They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the guy in a group chat. \n\nFirst, going through someone's phone without permission is a big no-no. Privacy is important in relationships, and that action alone can be a major breach of trust. Even if the person is jealous or feels insecure, invading someone's privacy isn't the right approach.\n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat. They were drunk, which might explain some of the impulsiveness, but that doesn't justify the action. Publicly calling out the girlfriend's friends and threatening to stop her from seeing them could be seen as aggressive and controlling. It might have escalated things unnecessarily, especially if the guy was just flirting but not doing anything inappropriate.\n\nThe girlfriend found out, leading to a big argument. The author still has her phone and is considering not returning it, which adds another layer of conflict. Holding onto someone's belongings as leverage isn't healthy and can make the situation worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions feeling justified because of the flirting they saw. But how they handled it was problematic. The right approach would be to talk to the girlfriend first, express their feelings, and address the issue together rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014privacy invasion, public confrontation, and withholding the phone\u2014are all wrong. They need to apologize and work on communication. The answer should be A.\n"
