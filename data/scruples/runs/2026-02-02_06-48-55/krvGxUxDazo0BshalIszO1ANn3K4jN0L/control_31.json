He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy whose girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends. Recently, after a reunion, she's been hanging out with them every weekend. The author found out that one of them is a guy, and he went through her phone to check her WhatsApp messages. He discovered that this guy was flirting with her using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" Then, he sent a message to the group chat, reminding them she has a boyfriend and saying she wouldn't go out with them again if he was there. He was a bit drunk and maybe did something extreme. They had a big argument, and he left. Now he's holding onto her phone, unsure if he should return it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the act of going through her phone without permission. That's a clear invasion of privacy. Even if he's concerned about her interactions, accessing her phone without her consent is a violation of trust. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and this action would likely breach that trust.\n\nThen there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat. He was drunk, which might affect his judgment, and his actions could be seen as confrontational. Sending a message to the group to assert his presence might be seen as overstepping, especially if he's accusing someone of flirting without giving her a chance to address it directly with him first. He didn't talk to her about his concerns before taking action, which could have been a more constructive approach.\n\nHe's also holding onto her phone, which is another issue. Keeping someone's belongings after a conflict isn't helpful and could be seen as trying to control or punish her. This could escalate the situation and show poor conflict resolution skills.\n\nOn the other hand, he might feel jealous and concerned about her spending time with someone he perceives as a threat. Jealousy is a common emotion, but acting on it in such a way without open communication is problematic. The right approach would be to express his feelings and discuss boundaries together rather than taking unilateral actions.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the key points are the invasion of privacy (checking her phone without permission), the public confrontation without discussing issues privately, and withholding her phone. These actions are generally considered wrong in a healthy relationship. The correct answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
