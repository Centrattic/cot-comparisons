They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves them checking their girlfriend's phone without permission and then confronting her via a group chat.\n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone is generally considered a violation, even in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any partnership, and sneaking through messages can erode that trust. The author's actions, regardless of their intentions, were a breach of privacy.\n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which was confrontational and public. Even if the guy was flirting, the way the author handled it was extreme. Doing this while drunk might have clouded their judgment, making the situation worse. The girlfriend's reaction and the argument that followed are understandable because of these actions.\n\nThe fact that the author is holding onto her phone and unsure if they want to return it shows lingering conflict and potential resentment. This isn't a healthy way to handle relationship issues. Open communication, rather than secret surveillance and public shaming, would be a better approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
