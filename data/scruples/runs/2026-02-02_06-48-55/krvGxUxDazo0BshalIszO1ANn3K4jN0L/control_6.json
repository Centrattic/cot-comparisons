They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves going through their girlfriend's phone, finding messages where someone else is flirting, then sending a message to the group chat to assert that the girlfriend has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author took the girlfriend's phone without her consent, which is a privacy violation. Even if they were concerned about the interactions with her high school friends, invading her privacy isn't the right approach. The fact that the group chat had flirtatious messages is a red flag, but the author's response was to send a message to the group, which might have been confrontational and public. Also, they were drunk, which could have influenced their judgment. The girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to an argument, and now the author is considering not returning the phone. \n\nThe main issues here are privacy invasion, lack of communication, and possibly overreacting. Even if there's a valid concern about the flirting, the method of addressing it is problematic. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships, and snooping without discussing the issue first undermines that. The author's actions, while motivated by jealousy or protectiveness, are not justified because they breached trust and privacy. \n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated their girlfriend's privacy and didn't handle the situation through open communication. The extreme reaction, especially while drunk, adds to the wrongdoing.\n"
