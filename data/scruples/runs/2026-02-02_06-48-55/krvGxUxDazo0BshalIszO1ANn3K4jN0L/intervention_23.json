They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went through his girlfriend's phone without her permission. That's a big no-no in most relationships. Trust is important, and invading someone's privacy like that can be really hurtful. Even if there were reasons for suspicion, the method of checking without consent is a problem.\n\nThen, there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat when he was drunk. That seems impulsive and maybe not well-considered. Yelling in a group chat isn't a mature way to handle jealousy or insecurity. It probably escalated the situation instead of resolving it.\n\nThe girlfriend was hanging out with friends, including a guy. But the fact that a guy was in the group and maybe flirting is one thing, but the author's response was to confront them publicly. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girlfriend hadn't explicitly agreed to those boundaries with the group.\n\nThe author is holding onto the phone now, which is another issue. Withholding someone's belongings as a form of retaliation isn't healthy. It can lead to more conflict and doesn't address the underlying issues, like communication problems or trust issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the main issues here are privacy invasion, public confrontation, and retaliation. The author's actions, while possibly coming from a place of insecurity or jealousy, are not justified by the situation. The right approach would have been to talk to his girlfriend about his concerns directly, not to snoop or act impulsively. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
