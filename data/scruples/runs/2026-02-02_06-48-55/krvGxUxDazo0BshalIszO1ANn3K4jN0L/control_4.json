They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author went through their girlfriend's phone. The girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found out by checking her messages, saw flirting, then sent a message to the group chat. They got into an argument, and now the author is holding onto the phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. Even if there was suspicion or jealousy, invading someone's privacy is generally considered a breach of trust. The author's actions were driven by their own feelings but don't excuse the violation of privacy. \n\nAdditionally, sending a message to the group chat while drunk might have been an overreaction. The justification of being \"a little drunk\" doesn't negate the wrongness of the action. The author is holding onto the phone now, which seems like retaliation, which is another issue.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about the concerns instead of checking her phone. The author's actions likely caused more harm by breaking trust and escalating the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for invading privacy and reacting impulsively. The answer should be A.\n"
