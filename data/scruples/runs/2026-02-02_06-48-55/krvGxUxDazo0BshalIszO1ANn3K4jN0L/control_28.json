They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about checking the girlfriend's phone and then confronting her via a group chat. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author went through his girlfriend's phone without her consent. That's a big red flag. Privacy is important in relationships, and invading someone's privacy like that is generally considered wrong, regardless of the situation.\n\nThen, when he found out there was a guy involved in the group chat, he sent a message to the group chat to confront them. He was drunk, which might have influenced his actions. But even if he was justified in feeling jealous, the way he handled it was extreme. Sending a message to the group chat to assert his presence and tell her not to hang out with them if the guy was there could be seen as controlling and not respectful of her autonomy.\n\nThe argument that followed and not returning the phone the next day suggests that the action was not just about confronting the issue but possibly about exerting power or punishment. Not returning her phone is a form of withholding something important, which can be considered emotionally abusive.\n\nThe key points here are privacy violation and the method of confrontation. Even if there was a legitimate concern about her interactions, the approach taken by the author was inappropriate. Healthy relationships involve communication, trust, and respect. Instead of secretly checking her phone and then making a public confrontation, he should have addressed his concerns directly with his girlfriend in a calm and respectful manner.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
