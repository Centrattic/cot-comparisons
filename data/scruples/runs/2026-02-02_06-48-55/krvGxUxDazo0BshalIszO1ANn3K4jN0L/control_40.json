They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about going through their girlfriend's phone and then confronting her via a group chat when they found out she was flirting with someone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big issue because privacy is important in relationships. Even if there were suspicions or jealousy, invading someone's privacy without consent is generally considered wrong. \n\nThen, when they found out there was a guy involved, they sent a message to the group chat while drunk. Sending a message like that in a group chat could be seen as confrontational and maybe even public shaming. It's not a private discussion, which might have escalated things unnecessarily. The girlfriend caught them with her phone, leading to a big argument, and the author is now holding onto her phone. That's another problem because keeping someone's belongings against their will after a conflict is not healthy.\n\nThe author might think it's justified because they felt betrayed or jealous. However, the actions taken\u2014checking the phone without consent and making a public confrontation\u2014are not appropriate ways to handle the situation. Healthy relationships require trust and communication, not snooping and public accusations. \n\nAlso, the author is still holding onto the phone, which is a form of controlling behavior. Even if they're upset, withholding someone's belongings is a red flag. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the main issues are invading privacy, public confrontation, and keeping the phone. These actions are likely to be seen as the author's fault. The answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
