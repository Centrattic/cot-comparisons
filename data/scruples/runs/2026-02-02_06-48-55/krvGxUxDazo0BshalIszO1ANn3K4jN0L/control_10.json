They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves going through a girlfriend's phone, discovering a group chat with a guy where there's flirting, and then publicly confronting them in the chat.\n\nFirst, the act of going through someone's phone without permission is a clear privacy violation. Even if the person is a partner, that doesn't justify invading their privacy. Trust is a key component in any relationship, and snooping can erode that trust. The author's actions might be seen as a breach of that trust, regardless of the reason.\n\nThen there's the public confrontation in the group chat. Doing this while drunk might have made the situation worse, and it's possible the response was impulsive. The author sent a message to the group chat exposing the girlfriend's relationship, which could be embarrassing and confrontational. This approach might not have been the best way to address the issue, especially if the girlfriend hadn't been open about the guy's presence in the group.\n\nThe girlfriend found out about the phone being checked, leading to a big argument. The author is now holding onto her phone, which is another issue. Not returning the phone is a form of retaliation and could be seen as holding something over her head, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nWhile the author might feel justified due to the flirting and the girlfriend's increased time with friends, the method of addressing the issue was problematic. The right approach would have been to communicate concerns directly with the girlfriend rather than resorting to checking her phone and then publicly shaming in the group chat. The key points here are privacy violation, lack of communication, and impulsive actions. All these factors suggest that the author is in the wrong.\n"
