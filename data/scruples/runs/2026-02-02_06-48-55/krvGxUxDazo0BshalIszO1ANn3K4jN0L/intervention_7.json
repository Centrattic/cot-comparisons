They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. They found out through these interactions that the guy was flirting with her, using terms like \"babe\" and \"darling.\" The author then took her phone, checked her WhatsApp messages, and sent a message to the group chat to confront the guy. Now they're holding onto her phone and are conflicted about returning it.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a big red flag. Privacy is important in relationships, and even if there's jealousy or suspicion, checking someone's phone without their consent is a violation of trust. The author might have had a reason, but the method they used is problematic.\n\nThen there's the part about sending a message to the group chat. The author was drunk, which could have influenced their judgment. Confronting the guy in a public group chat is aggressive and might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. It's possible that a private conversation with the girlfriend first would have been a better approach.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction and the resulting argument suggest that the author's actions hurt her. The fact that the author is still holding onto the phone indicates a lack of resolution and maybe an attempt to exert control, which is another issue. Trust and communication are key here, and the author's actions probably damaged both.\n\nHowever, the situation involves the girlfriend's interactions with someone else who was flirting with her. That's a valid concern for any partner. But the way the author handled it was inappropriate. Instead of confronting the issue directly with the girlfriend first, they took matters into their own hands, which led to a breakdown in their relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author had a reason to be upset, the actions they took\u2014without consent and in a confrontational way\u2014were wrong. The right approach would have been to communicate their feelings to the girlfriend and address the issue together, not through surveillance or public confrontation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
