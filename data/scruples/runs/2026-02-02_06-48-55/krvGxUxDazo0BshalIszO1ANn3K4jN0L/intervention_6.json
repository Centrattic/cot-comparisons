They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone is a big no-no in relationships. Even if they're in a relationship, people have the right to their own privacy. The author did this without consent, which is a problem. \n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat while drunk. That's impulsive and could have been handled better. Arguing with the girlfriend and not returning her phone adds to the conflict. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior of hanging out with her friends, including a guy she admitted to being with, might be concerning, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. Trust is important, and breaking into someone's phone undermines that trust. \n\nEven though the author felt justified because of the flirting in the chat, the method of confronting it was extreme. Instead of sending a public message, maybe a private conversation would have been better. \n\nSo, combining all these points: invading privacy, acting impulsively, and escalating the situation without proper communication. The answer seems to be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
