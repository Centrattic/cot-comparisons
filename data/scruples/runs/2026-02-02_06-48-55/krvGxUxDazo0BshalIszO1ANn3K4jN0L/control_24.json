They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found this out and, while drunk, checked her WhatsApp messages, discovered flirting, and sent a message to the group chat. They now have her phone and are considering not returning it.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without permission is a clear invasion of privacy, regardless of the reason. Even if there was a suspicion of something wrong, the method used (without consent) is problematic. The author's actions were a breach of trust. Also, sending a message to the group chat in a confrontational manner might have been impulsive and not the best way to address the issue. The fact that they were drunk adds to the impulsiveness, which doesn't excuse the behavior but explains the lack of judgment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable because privacy is a fundamental aspect in relationships. Trust is built on respecting each other's boundaries. The author might feel justified due to the flirting, but the right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend directly instead of snooping. Holding onto her phone as a form of punishment is also not a healthy way to handle conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of going through the phone without consent is a violation. So, the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
