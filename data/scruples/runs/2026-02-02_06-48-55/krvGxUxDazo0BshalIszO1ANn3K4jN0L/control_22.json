They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves checking their girlfriend's phone without permission and then confronting the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of going through someone's phone. That's generally considered a privacy violation. Even if they're in a relationship, people have the right to their own privacy. So the author took something that's not theirs and looked through private messages. That's a big no-no.\n\nThen, the author sent a message to the group chat, which escalated the situation. Even if they were upset, doing that publicly could be seen as aggressive and not the best way to handle things. The fact that they were drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it doesn't excuse the behavior entirely.\n\nThe girlfriend caught them with the phone, leading to an argument. The author is holding onto the phone, which is probably making things worse. Taking someone's phone and not returning it is a form of retaliation and could be seen as a power play, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was hanging out with someone who was flirting with her. The author felt justified in checking the phone because of the trust issues. But the right way to handle that would be to talk to the girlfriend directly, not invade her privacy.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author definitely violated the girlfriend's privacy and reacted in a way that caused more conflict. Even if the other person was at fault, the method used was wrong. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
