They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves him going through his girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with someone who's flirting with her. He then sent a message to the group chat confronting them and took her phone without returning it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of checking someone's phone without permission. That's generally seen as a violation of privacy. Even if there's jealousy involved, invading someone's privacy without their consent is usually considered wrong. Privacy is a big thing in relationships, and trust is important. If he didn't trust her, that might be an issue in the relationship itself.\n\nThen there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat. That seems like a public confrontation, which could be hurtful and escalate things. He was drunk, which might mitigate some responsibility, but it's still not an excuse for his actions. Also, keeping her phone without returning it is a form of withholding something important, which can be seen as manipulative or controlling.\n\nThe user mentioned that the girlfriend was hanging out with high school friends, including a guy who was flirting. The author's reaction was based on jealousy, but the way he handled it\u2014checking her phone and then publicly confronting\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. Healthy communication would be better than sneaking around and then acting impulsively.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author violated her privacy, acted impulsively, and is now holding her phone hostage. All these actions contribute to him being in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
