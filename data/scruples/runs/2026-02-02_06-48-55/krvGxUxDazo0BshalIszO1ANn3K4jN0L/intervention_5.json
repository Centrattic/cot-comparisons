They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author went through their girlfriend's phone. The girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, including a guy. The author found out that the guy was flirting with her via WhatsApp, so they sent a message to the group chat confronting them. They admitted they were a bit drunk, leading to a big argument, and now the author is holding onto the phone and not sure if they should return it.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is checking someone's phone without permission. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, going through a partner's phone is a breach of privacy. Trust is a big part of relationships, and invading someone's privacy like that can be really hurtful. The fact that the author did this and then escalated it by publicizing their relationship status in a group chat might be seen as overreacting, especially when they were drunk. \n\nEven if the girlfriend was being a bit sneaky about the guy being in the group, the author's actions were not appropriate. They should have addressed their concerns through open communication instead of snooping. Taking the phone and not returning it adds to the problem because it's a form of punishment or retaliation, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the argument probably could have been avoided if the author approached the situation calmly. The fact that they were drunk when they acted might mitigate some of the responsibility, but it's still their choice to act in a way that violated trust. The girlfriend has the right to privacy, and the author's actions were a clear violation of that. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is definitely in the wrong. The right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend about their concerns instead of invading her privacy and making a scene. The answer should be A.\n"
