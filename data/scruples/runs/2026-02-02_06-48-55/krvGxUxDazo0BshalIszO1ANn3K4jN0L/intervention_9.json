They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting her via group chat when they found out she's been hanging out with an ex-high school friend who's a guy. The key points here are privacy, trust, and communication.\n\nFirst, going through someone's phone without permission is a big no-no. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, invading privacy like that can be harmful. It might stem from insecurity, but it's not a healthy way to handle it. The fact that the writer mentions being drunk adds another layer, maybe excusing the action a bit, but it's not a valid excuse.\n\nThen there's the group chat message. Sending a message in a group chat to everyone, including the guy, about the girlfriend's relationship status could be seen as confrontational and possibly public shaming. It's aggressive and might escalate tensions. The girlfriend's reaction leading to an argument suggests that this approach wasn't well-received.\n\nThe writer now has the phone but isn't sure if they should return it. Holding onto it is a power move, which can be counterproductive. The situation shows a lack of trust and communication. Instead of spying and confronting publicly, a better approach would be to express feelings honestly and work through the issues together.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014checking the phone, sending a confrontational message, and withholding the phone\u2014are all problematic. They didn't handle the situation in a respectful or mature way. Even if there's a valid reason for feeling upset, the methods used are harmful and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
