They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, and one of them is a guy. The author found out that the guy was flirting with her via WhatsApp messages. They took her phone without permission, read the messages, then sent a message to the group chat confronting them. Now they're holding onto the phone, not sure if they should return it.\n\nSo, the main issue here is checking a partner's phone without their consent. I think that's a big no-no. Privacy is important in relationships, even if there's trust issues. By going through her phone, the author violated her privacy. Even if they were concerned about the flirting, the right approach would be to talk to her first instead of spying. The fact that they did this when she wasn't looking and then sent a message in the group chat without discussing it with her first makes it worse. Also, keeping her phone as leverage after an argument isn't healthy.\n\nThe author might feel justified because of the flirting, but using deception and invasion of privacy isn't the right way to handle it. Communication is key. They should have addressed their concerns directly with her, not through covert actions. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
