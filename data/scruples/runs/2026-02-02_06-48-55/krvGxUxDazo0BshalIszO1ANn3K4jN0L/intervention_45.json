They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, including a guy, and the author checking her messages and then confronting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general consensus on privacy in relationships. Most people would agree that checking a partner's phone without consent is a breach of trust. Privacy is important, so even if there's suspicion or jealousy, going through someone's phone is usually seen as a no-go. The fact that the author did this while drunk might add context, but it doesn't necessarily justify the action. \n\nThe author found out about the guy through their own investigation, which is problematic because it's based on unauthorized access. The group chat with obvious flirting could be seen as a reason, but the method of confronting them by sending a message to the group is extreme and public. That could be hurtful and disrespectful to the girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the author is holding onto the phone and not returning it, which is a power move and could escalate the conflict. The girlfriend might feel disrespected and invaded. Even if the author feels justified, the action of invading privacy is typically considered wrong in most relationships advice contexts. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They violated the girlfriend's privacy, acted out in a public manner, and are now withholding the phone. These actions are likely to damage the trust and respect in the relationship.\n"
