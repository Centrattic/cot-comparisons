They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who went through their girlfriend's phone is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend has been spending a lot of time with her high school friends. The author later finds out that one of them is a guy, goes through her phone, and sees flirtatious messages. Then he confronts them in a group chat while drunk. Now, they're arguing, and he's holding onto her phone.\n\nSo, the key points here. The main issue is invading privacy by checking the phone without permission. Even if there's jealousy or suspicion, going through someone's phone is a breach of trust. The argument is about whether that action justifies the means.\n\nThe author might feel justified because of the flirting, but the method of confronting them in the group chat while drunk could be seen as impulsive and extreme. The girlfriend might feel her privacy was violated, which can damage the relationship.\n\nAlso, holding onto her phone after the argument is another point. That's taking things further and could be controlling behavior. Even if there's a reason, the way it's handled matters. Trust and communication are important in relationships. Instead of spying, talking openly about the concerns might be better.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the act of checking the phone without consent is wrong regardless of the reason. The response in the group chat was harsh, and keeping the phone is a power move. So, the answer is likely A) Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
