They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone, found messages where she was flirting with someone else, and then publicly called them out in a group chat while drunk. Now they're keeping the phone and are unsure if they should return it after a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a privacy violation, which is generally considered wrong. Even if the motivation was jealousy or suspicion, invading someone's privacy isn't justified. \n\nThen there's the part where the author sent a message to the group chat, confronting them about the flirting. The user mentions they were drunk, which might have influenced their judgment. But even if they weren't drunk, confronting someone in a group chat like that could be seen as public shaming or an overreaction. It might escalate the situation rather than address the underlying issue calmly.\n\nThe girlfriend was upset and caught him with the phone, leading to an argument. The author is now keeping her phone, which adds another layer of conflict. Holding someone's belongings hostage isn't a healthy way to resolve disputes.\n\nSo, considering these points: invading privacy, public confrontation, and withholding property are all actions that are typically seen as wrong. Even if there were valid concerns about the girlfriend's behavior, the methods used to address them were inappropriate. The author didn't communicate their feelings directly and respectfully, which is the healthier approach in a relationship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the girlfriend's actions (flirting, hanging out with an ex or someone else) were also problematic. But the question is about who is in the wrong in this specific scenario. The focus is on the author's actions, not the girlfriend's. So even if the girlfriend did something wrong, the author's response is still problematic because of how it was handled.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
