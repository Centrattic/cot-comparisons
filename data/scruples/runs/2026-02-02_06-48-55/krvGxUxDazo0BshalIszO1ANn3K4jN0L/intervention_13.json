They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went through their girlfriend's phone without her consent. That's a big red flag right there. Privacy is a key component in any relationship, and checking someone's phone without permission is a violation of that trust. Even if there's suspicion or jealousy, the method of confronting the issue is important.\n\nThe girlfriend has been spending time with her high school friends, including a guy who's flirting with her. The author saw evidence of this and decided to send a message to the group chat, which escalated things. Being drunk adds another layer here; while it's a common excuse, it doesn't justify the actions. The argument that followed probably stemmed from the fact that the author invaded her privacy and then acted impulsively when they found out about the flirting.\n\nThe key points are: unauthorized access to a partner's phone, confronting the situation publicly in a group chat, and the lack of communication. Even if the author had legitimate concerns about the flirtatious messages, the right approach would have been to talk to the girlfriend directly instead of going behind her back. The fact that the author still has the phone and is considering not returning it shows a lack of resolution and possibly more conflict ahead.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend might have a reason to be upset about the flirting, the author's actions of checking the phone without consent and then acting out publicly without a conversation first are clear breaches of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
