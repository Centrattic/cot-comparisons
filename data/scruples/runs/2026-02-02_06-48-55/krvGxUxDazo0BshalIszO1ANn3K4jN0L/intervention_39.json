They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves going through their girlfriend's phone and sending a message to a group chat where she was flirting with someone else.\n\nFirst, the act of going through someone's phone without permission is a clear violation of privacy. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy, it's still an invasion of trust. Relationships require mutual respect, and checking a partner's phone without their knowledge breaches that. \n\nThe person mentions being drunk, which might explain some of the actions but doesn't excuse them. They also sent a message to the group chat, which is confrontational and could be seen as aggressive. The girlfriend was upset about the phone being taken, leading to an argument. The writer is considering not returning the phone, which is another issue because it's not their property to withhold.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of flirting in a group chat are problematic too, but that doesn't justify the writer's actions. The key points here are privacy violation, lack of communication, and using alcohol as an excuse. The writer's response was extreme and possibly damaging to the relationship. \n\nSo, even though there's a reason behind the actions, the method used was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
