They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the group chat. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend started hanging out with her high school friends, which turned out to include a guy. The author, without consent, went through her phone and found flirtatious messages. Then, while drunk, he sent a message to the group chat to assert their relationship and prevent future meetings. They had an argument, and now he's holding onto her phone.\n\nSo, the main points here are about privacy and trust. The author didn't ask before checking her phone. That's a breach of trust, right? Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even if the messages were inappropriate, the method of finding out was invasive. Maybe the guy has a point about being upset, but the way he handled it\u2014without communication\u2014could be seen as the problem. \n\nAlso, confronting the group chat while drunk might have been impulsive. The author didn't talk to his girlfriend first to address his concerns. Instead, he took matters into his own hands, which could have caused unnecessary conflict. Holding onto her phone afterwards seems like an escalation. \n\nSo, even if the girlfriend's actions were questionable, the author's actions violated her privacy. The right approach would have been to discuss his feelings with her first, not snoop. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
