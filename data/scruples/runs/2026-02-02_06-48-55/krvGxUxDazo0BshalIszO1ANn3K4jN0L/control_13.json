They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the text is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation is that the girlfriend has been hanging out with high school friends, and one of them is a guy. The author found out through the WhatsApp messages that there's flirting happening, so they confronted the group by sending a message.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether it's right to check a partner's phone without their consent. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. Even though the author might have felt jealous or concerned, invading the girlfriend's privacy by accessing her phone without asking is generally considered wrong. Trust is important, and checking someone's phone without permission can break that trust, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe author was drunk when they acted, which might have led to impulsive behavior, but that doesn't excuse the action. Being drunk could be a mitigating factor, but the act itself\u2014reading messages and sending a message to the group\u2014was a breach of privacy. The fact that there was actual flirting might make the author feel justified, but the method they used to address it is questionable. Instead of going through her phone, they could have talked to her first, expressed their feelings, and asked to see the messages if necessary, with her consent.\n\nAlso, holding onto the phone after the argument isn't a good idea. It's a personal item, and keeping it without returning could lead to more conflict. The author might be trying to hold onto it as a form of leverage, but that's not healthy. The justification based on the guy's messages doesn't negate the fact that the initial action was a violation of privacy. Relationships should be built on communication and mutual respect, not on snooping. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
