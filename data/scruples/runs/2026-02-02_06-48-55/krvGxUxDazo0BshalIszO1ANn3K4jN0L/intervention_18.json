They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if it's their fault for checking their girlfriend's phone. The girlfriend has been hanging out a lot with her high school friends, and one of them turned out to be a guy. The author went through her phone, saw the group chat with flirting, then sent a message to the group.\n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by going through their phone is a big issue. Even if there were suspicions, doing that without consent is a breach of trust. The girlfriend probably felt violated when she found out. The argument that followed and taking the phone without returning it also adds to the problem. Even if there was jealousy or anger, the method used was extreme and not the right way to handle it. The author should have communicated their feelings and concerns instead of acting impulsively. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
