They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who went through his girlfriend's phone after finding out one of her high school friends is a guy. He saw them flirting in a group chat, got drunk, sent a message to the group chat about her having a boyfriend, and now he's holding onto her phone. They had a big argument, and he's not sure if he should return it.\n\nHmm. First, the main issue here is privacy. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no. Even if he was suspicious or jealous, it's not right to invade her privacy. Trust is important in a relationship, and this action probably broke that trust. \n\nThen there's the part where he sent a message to the group chat. Even if the guy was flirting, confronting them publicly like that, especially while drunk, could be seen as aggressive. It might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. He didn't talk to his girlfriend first about his concerns, which is the mature approach. Instead, he took matters into his own hands, which can be seen as controlling or overstepping.\n\nAlso, holding onto her phone after the argument is another problem. That's taking things a step further by withholding her property, which isn't right. Even if he's upset, keeping her phone is a form of punishment and doesn't resolve the underlying issues.\n\nThe girlfriend was hanging out with her friends, which is her right unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. The fact that one of them was a guy doesn't automatically make it wrong. The flirting is a red flag, but the appropriate response would be to talk to his girlfriend about how he feels, not to snoop and act out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author violated his girlfriend's privacy, acted impulsively while drunk, and took retaliatory actions. These actions are not justified and are definitely in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
