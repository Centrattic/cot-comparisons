They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone and then sent a message to a group chat confronting her friends, including a guy who was flirting with her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issues here. The key points are: the author went through the girlfriend's phone without permission, found flirting messages, and then confronted the group, which led to an argument. \n\nGoing through someone's phone is a big breach of trust. Even if the author had concerns about her girlfriend hanging out with others, including a guy, the right approach would be to communicate openly rather than invade her privacy. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and snooping without consent is generally considered wrong. \n\nThe author's action of sending a message to the group chat, especially while drunk, might have been a reaction to the information found. However, that doesn't justify the initial act of checking the phone. The argument that followed and the refusal to return the phone the next day shows a lack of respect and maturity in handling the situation.\n\nEven if the author felt justified due to the flirting messages, the methods used were inappropriate. The right approach would be to discuss the concerns directly with the girlfriend instead of taking matters into their own hands. The fact that the author is still holding onto the phone suggests a lack of willingness to resolve the issue respectfully.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the main issue is the breach of privacy. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by jealousy, were not the correct way to handle the situation. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
