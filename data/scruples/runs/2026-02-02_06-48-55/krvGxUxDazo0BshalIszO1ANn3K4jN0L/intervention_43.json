They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for checking their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with high school friends, one of whom is a guy. The author found out through the phone that the guy was flirting, then confronted them in a group chat. Now, the girlfriend is upset, and the author is holding onto her phone.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. Checking a partner's phone without permission is a big no-no. Even if there's suspicion of something wrong, invading someone's privacy without their consent is a breach of trust. The author's actions, regardless of the reason, are a violation of that trust. \n\nThen there's the confrontation part. The author sent a message to the group chat, which might have been a way to address the flirting, but doing it publicly and while drunk could be seen as aggressive and immature. The girlfriend probably felt embarrassed or humiliated by being publicly called out, which could damage the relationship further.\n\nEven if the author felt justified because of the flirting, the method used was extreme. The argument and not returning the phone show that the situation has escalated, and the author is holding onto the phone out of spite, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, considering privacy violation, public confrontation, and the author's reaction, it's clear the author made mistakes. The right approach would have been to communicate with the girlfriend first, discuss the concerns, and address the issue without spying. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
