They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went through their girlfriend's phone and then confronted a group chat where someone was flirting with her. The key points here are about privacy and trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, invading someone's privacy by checking their phone without permission is generally considered a violation. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy or suspicion, that doesn't make the action right. The author mentions they were drunk, which might have influenced their judgment, but it's not an excuse for the behavior. \n\nThen there's the part where they sent a message to the group chat. That could be seen as an overreaction, especially since they didn't talk to their girlfriend about their concerns first. Confronting the situation directly with her and discussing boundaries would have been a better approach. \n\nThe girlfriend found out and there was a big argument. The author is holding onto the phone, which is a power move but not helpful. Taking her phone without returning it is another issue because it's her property and they should resolve things without holding onto her belongings.\n\nSo, considering all these aspects, the author's actions\u2014privacy invasion, confrontation via group chat while drunk, and withholding the phone\u2014seem to be their fault. Even if the guy was flirting, the method of handling it was problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable given the violation of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
