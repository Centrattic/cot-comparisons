They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, who is a guy, went through his girlfriend's phone. The girlfriend has been hanging out with her high school friends, and he found out one of them is a guy. He took her phone without her knowing, checked her WhatsApp messages, and saw that she was in a group chat with this guy where they were clearly flirting. Then he sent a message to the group chat, telling them she has a boyfriend and that she won't go out with them if that guy is there. He was a bit drunk, and now they had a big argument. He's still holding onto her phone.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the act of going through someone's phone without permission is a big no-no. Even if he was suspicious, invading someone's privacy like that is a breach of trust. It doesn't matter if he thought there was a reason; doing it without her consent is a problem. \n\nThen, when he found the messages, he didn't talk to her first. Instead, he acted on his own by sending a message to the group chat. That's pretty extreme. He should have addressed his concerns directly with her, not publicly in a group chat. That could have made the situation worse and possibly embarrassed her.\n\nAlso, he's holding onto her phone. That's another issue because it's a form of control or punishment, which isn't healthy in a relationship. Even if she did something wrong, keeping her phone isn't the right way to handle it. \n\nHe mentions he was drunk, which might have clouded his judgment, but that's not an excuse for his actions. The main issues here are privacy violation, not communicating properly, and overreacting. \n\nSo, even if the girlfriend was flirting, the way he handled it was wrong. He should have talked to her first instead of taking matters into his own hands. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
