They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. They found messages from a guy in a group chat where he was flirting with her. The author then sent a message to the group chat confronting them, leading to an argument. Now the author is keeping the phone, not sure if they should return it.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is invading privacy. Even if the author had concerns about their girlfriend's interactions, looking through her phone without consent is a breach of trust. Privacy is a big deal in relationships. People generally expect that their personal messages are private. The author's action of going through the phone, regardless of the context, is a violation. \n\nThen there's the part about sending a message to the group chat while drunk. That's another problem. Confronting them publicly might have been an overreaction, especially under the influence. It could have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From a general ethical standpoint, respecting a partner's privacy is crucial. Even if there were suspicions of flirting or jealousy, the method of addressing it should be through communication with the girlfriend herself, not through spying. The author's actions undermined trust and could cause more harm to the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a clue. She caught him with her phone, leading to a big argument. That shows she felt her privacy was invaded. The author now holding onto the phone as a \"lever\" isn't a healthy way to handle the situation either. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were wrong because they violated their girlfriend's privacy. Even if the motive was jealousy or concern, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
