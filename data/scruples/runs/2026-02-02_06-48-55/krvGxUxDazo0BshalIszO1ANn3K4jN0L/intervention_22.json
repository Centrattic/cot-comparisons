They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author going through his girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with someone who's flirting with her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has been spending time with her high school friends, including a guy who's clearly flirting. The author, after some alcohol, checks her phone and sends a message to the group chat. The girlfriend found out, they argued, and now the author is holding onto her phone.\n\nNow, considering privacy issues. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a big no-no in most relationships. Even if there's jealousy involved, invading privacy is a common problem but usually considered a mistake. The fact that the author was drunk might add some context, but it doesn't excuse the action. \n\nAlso, how the author handled the situation was extreme. Instead of talking to his girlfriend about his concerns, he took matters into his own hands by publicly shaming the group. That could have been hurtful and might have escalated things unnecessarily. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. She caught him with her phone, leading to an argument. The author holding onto her phone now is another problem because it's her property and he's withholding it, which isn't right regardless of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid feelings of jealousy because of the flirting messages. However, the way he addressed it was inappropriate. Healthy communication is key in relationships, and confronting issues through direct conversation instead of surveillance is the right approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong. He violated privacy, acted out of jealousy in an extreme manner, and withheld property. Even if the situation was tense, the methods used were not acceptable. So the answer should be A.\n"
