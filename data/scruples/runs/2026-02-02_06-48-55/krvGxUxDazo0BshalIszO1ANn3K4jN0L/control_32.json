They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone after finding out she's been hanging out with old friends, one of whom is a guy. The author went through her WhatsApp and found flirting messages, then confronted them in the group chat while drunk. Now they're holding onto her phone and considering not returning it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is the act of going through the girlfriend's phone without consent. Privacy is a big factor in relationships. Even if there's suspicion of wrongdoing, accessing someone's phone without permission is a violation of trust and boundaries. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by jealousy or insecurity, are ethically questionable. \n\nNext, the response in the group chat was extreme, especially considering the author was drunk. Confronting the group publicly might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The girlfriend had a right to privacy, and the author's actions could have caused her distress. \n\nAlso, holding onto the phone is a form of retaliation and isn't a healthy way to resolve conflicts. The author might feel justified due to the flirting, but the method used to address it was inappropriate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of sneaking through the phone, the author should have talked to the girlfriend about their concerns. The act of checking the phone breaches trust, which is a foundational element in any relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, though perhaps stemming from insecurity, are in the wrong because they violated privacy and handled the situation in an extreme manner. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
