They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about checking their girlfriend's phone and then confronting the group chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author went through their girlfriend's phone without permission. That's a privacy issue. Even if there were reasons like jealousy or suspicion, invading someone's privacy is generally not acceptable. \n\nThen, when they found out there was a guy in the group chat, they sent a message to the group. The user mentions being drunk and maybe being a bit extreme. Even if the content was inappropriate, the method of handling it\u2014without discussing it first\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend caught them with the phone, leading to an argument. The author is now keeping the phone, which adds to the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. Checking a partner's phone without consent can break that trust, regardless of the reason. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by feelings of insecurity, are still a violation of privacy. \n\nAlso, the response to the situation (publicly confronting in the chat) is not a mature way to handle it. Open communication would have been better than taking matters into their own hands, especially while under the influence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong. They violated privacy and handled the situation poorly. The answer should be A.\n"
