They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about checking their girlfriend's phone.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy. The author took the phone without permission, which is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there were reasons like jealousy or suspicion, that doesn't excuse the action. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping can break that trust. \n\nThen, when they found the messages, they publicly called out the guy in a group chat. That's pretty harsh and confrontational. It might have been a way to assert their claim, but it's not handling the situation maturely. The fact that they were drunk adds another layer because it suggests they weren't thinking clearly, which can lead to impulsive actions.\n\nThe girlfriend caught them with the phone, leading to a big argument and the author not returning the phone. Holding onto the phone after the conflict isn't helping the situation; it's more like holding a grudge. The author might be trying to hold onto some power in the situation, but that's not a healthy approach.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. Instead of checking the phone, the right approach would be to talk to the girlfriend about their concerns. If there were trust issues, addressing them directly would be better than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong. They violated privacy, acted impulsively, and didn't handle the conflict constructively. The answer should be A.\n"
