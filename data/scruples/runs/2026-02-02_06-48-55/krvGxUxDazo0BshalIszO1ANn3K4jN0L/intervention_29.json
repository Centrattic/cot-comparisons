They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves checking a girlfriend's phone without consent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author went through their girlfriend's phone, found messages where a guy was flirting with her, then confronted the group via WhatsApp. The girlfriend found out and there was an argument.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy. People generally have the right to privacy, even in relationships. Checking someone's phone without their permission is a big breach of trust. Even if the author felt jealous or insecure, the method of confronting the situation by sending a message in the group chat might have been impulsive, especially when drunk. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the invasion of privacy was worse than the flirting, which could have been discussed openly. The author's actions could lead to bigger trust issues in the relationship. The fact that the author still has the phone and is considering not returning it shows a lack of understanding of the harm done.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions might have been to protect the relationship, the method was clearly wrong. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong because violating someone's privacy is a significant issue regardless of the reason.\n"
