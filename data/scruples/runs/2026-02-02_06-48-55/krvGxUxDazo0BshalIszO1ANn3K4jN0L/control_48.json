They had a little reunion a could of weeks ago and she's been hanging out with them every weekend since.\n\nI thought these were just a bunch of girls, but last night she admitted that one of them was a guy. When I had the chance I took out her phone from her bag and went through her WhatsApp messages.\n\nShe was having a group chat with this guy OBVIOUSLY flirting with her. He was literally calling her babe and darling and other shit like that so I sent a message to the group chat just reminding them she had a boyfriend and saying she wasn't going out with them again if he was there. \n\nI was a little bit drunk, and maybe what I did was a bit extreme but I feel like it was justified. She caught me with her phone in my hands and we had a pretty big argument, and I went home alone. I just woke up now real hung over. I've still got her phone but I'm not sure I want to return it after last night lol\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for going through their girlfriend's phone. The situation involves the girlfriend hanging out with friends, which the boyfriend later found out included a guy. The boyfriend then checked her phone and sent a message to the group chat when he discovered flirtatious messages.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions taken. Going through someone's phone without their consent is a clear invasion of privacy. Even if there's a reason, like jealousy, that doesn't justify the action. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and snooping undermines that trust. The boyfriend could have approached the situation by talking to his girlfriend first, asking her about the guy, instead of taking matters into his own hands. \n\nMoreover, sending a message to the group chat while drunk might have been an impulsive and extreme reaction. It's possible the girlfriend felt disrespected and betrayed by both the snooping and the public confrontation. The fact that the boyfriend is now keeping her phone and hesitating to return it suggests he's aware of the seriousness of his actions. \n\nWhile the girlfriend might have been spending time with others, including someone the boyfriend didn't know about, the response from the boyfriend was inappropriate. The right approach would have been communication, not intrusion and confrontation. So, the author is in the wrong because his actions violated trust and privacy, regardless of the reasons.\n"
