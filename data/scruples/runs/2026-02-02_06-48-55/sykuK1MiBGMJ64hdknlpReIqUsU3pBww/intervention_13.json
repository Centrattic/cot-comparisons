I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The situation is about a man who won the lottery, wants to give his ex a significant sum, and his girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The key points are: he had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives. He wants to give her money to show he cares, maybe as a way to make up for his past mistakes. His girlfriend is angry, thinking he's still in love with the ex or at least being disrespectful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the ex is the mother of his children, and he wants to support them and her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job. The lawyer and parents support this, so maybe there's some legal or familial agreement. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected. The act of giving a large sum to an ex without consulting the current partner could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for the current relationship.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, from a relationship perspective, not consulting his girlfriend is a valid point. Even if his intentions are good, involving the current partner in major financial decisions is important. However, since the ex is the co-parent, there might be reasons he doesn't need her permission, like child support or shared custody arrangements. But he's giving her extra beyond that, which could be seen as a personal gesture. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling undermined. If he's not in love with the ex but still values her as a parent, maybe the girlfriend's issue is more about insecurity or perceiving him as still emotionally connected.\n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complicated. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and not discussing it with her shows a lack of respect for the relationship. Even if his intentions are positive, the impact on his current partner matters. So, while his actions might be understandable from his perspective, the failure to communicate with his girlfriend could be where he's in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and respect for his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
