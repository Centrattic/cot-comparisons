I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author cheated on his ex-wife with his current girlfriend. That's a major point. He acknowledges he was in a bad place when he cheated. Now, after winning money, he wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, the mother of his kids. His reasons include wanting to show he's not a complete failure, helping her financially since she works a low-paying job, and supporting their kids. \n\nHis girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with his ex or at least disrespecting her. The author says he's not in love with the ex anymore but still loves her as a parent and co-parent. The girlfriend threatens to break up if he goes through with this. The author feels relieved about the threats, indicating some conflict here.\n\nNow, considering the situation, several factors come into play. Legally, in many places, after a divorce, you might not have an obligation to support your ex unless there are child support arrangements or alimony. But this is a voluntary gesture, not a legal requirement. However, the author's decision to give money without consulting his girlfriend is causing strain. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Being in a new relationship and finding out the partner is giving a substantial amount to an ex, especially after a past affair, can feel like a betrayal. It might make her question the author's commitment to the current relationship. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the action could be perceived as favoring the ex, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons: helping his ex-wife who's struggling financially, supporting their kids, and showing gratitude for her past kindness. The ex-wife is a positive figure, and the author's intentions seem genuine. \n\nBut the key issue here is the relationship with the current girlfriend. The author didn't consult her, and this decision is causing serious conflict. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend before making the decision, maybe they could have found a compromise. However, moving forward without her input, especially when it's a significant life decision, can be seen as disrespectful to her feelings and the current relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. His intentions are good, but the method of handling it without considering his girlfriend's perspective is problematic. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's decision to proceed despite her anger could be seen as prioritizing his ex's well-being over his current partner's feelings, which might not be fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong not because of the act itself, but because of how it's affecting his current relationship and the lack of communication with his girlfriend.\n"
