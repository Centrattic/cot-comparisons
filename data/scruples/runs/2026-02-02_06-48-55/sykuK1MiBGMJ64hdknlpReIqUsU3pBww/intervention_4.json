I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery winnings, despite his current girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from his ex-wife. Now, he's won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. His reasons include wanting to show he's not a complete failure, helping her financially (as she works a low-paying job), and benefiting the children. He's discussed this with his parents and lawyer, who support it. However, his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex, and he feels relieved by her breakup threats.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points are the legality, the relationship dynamics, and the fairness to all parties. The author isn't legally obligated to give the ex-wife money unless ordered by the court, but they divorced 6 years ago. Since the lawyer is on board, it's probably legal. The main conflict is with the girlfriend. The author's actions might be disrespectful to his current relationship if he didn't discuss it with her first. However, he has the right to manage his money as he sees fit. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because he didn't consult her, but the author's reasons are personal and related to his children and past. \n\nThe question is whether his decision is wrong. If he's using his money to help the mother of his children and he's not in a relationship with her anymore, some might argue it's right. But if he's doing it to appease his ex-wife or because he's still emotionally attached, that could be problematic. However, the author claims he only loves his ex-wife as a mother and co-parent. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid concern. However, the author isn't in the wrong if he's making a personal decision with his money, even if it causes conflict in his current relationship. So the answer might be B (No). But I need to consider if there's an obligation to consult his girlfriend first. Since it's his money and not part of their shared assets (assuming it's his personal win), he's not wrong to decide to give it away. Still, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
