I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger. So, the situation is that he won a significant amount of money, and he wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. He mentions that he had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives and being respectful post-divorce. The girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still being in love with the ex, even though he claims he's not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user says he discussed this with his lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So legally, it might be okay. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nEthically, giving money to an ex can be a gray area. The author feels it's a way to show appreciation and support, especially since the ex works a low-paying job and has the kids. However, his current girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected. In a relationship, partners have expectations about how shared resources are used. Even if the money is won by the author, his girlfriend might see it as part of their shared life now, especially if they are in a committed relationship. \n\nThe author might not have consulted his girlfriend before making the decision, which could be seen as a breach of trust or communication. Even if the ex is a good co-parent, giving a large sum without discussing it with the current partner could cause conflict. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her feelings and the relationship's dynamics are being ignored. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is to support his children's mother and improve her life. The ex's role in the kids' lives is significant, and the author might genuinely want to make amends for past mistakes. The question becomes whether the method of doing so is appropriate. \n\nIn relationships, financial decisions can be sensitive. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that the author is prioritizing his ex over their relationship. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex anymore, the gesture could be perceived as a betrayal. \n\nOn the other hand, if the money is given to ensure the children's well-being and support the ex in her role as a parent, it's a noble intent. The author might be acting in the children's best interest. But the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered as well. The lack of communication here is a key factor. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are seen as respectful to both his ex and his current partner. If the ex is the children's mother and the author is paying child support, maybe this is an additional gesture beyond that. But if the girlfriend feels it's unnecessary and disrespectful, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is solely trying to do good by his ex and children, and the girlfriend is overreacting, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, the situation is complex, and the author's failure to communicate with his girlfriend could be a mistake. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are positive, the method of proceeding without discussing it with his current partner might be where he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have considered her perspective before making such a significant decision.\n"
