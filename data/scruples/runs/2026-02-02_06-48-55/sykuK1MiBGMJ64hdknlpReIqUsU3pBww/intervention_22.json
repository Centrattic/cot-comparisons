I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where someone is considering giving their ex-wife a large sum of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend's anger. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person had an affair and left their ex-wife, who's the mother of their two kids. The ex-wife is portrayed as saint-like, allowing the relationship with the kids and handling the divorce amicably. Now, they want to give her a significant amount of money to help her out, especially since she works a low-paying job. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves the ex. He's not in love with the ex anymore but still loves them as a co-parent and for their good qualities.\n\nSo, the main question is whether giving this money is wrong. From a legal standpoint, the lawyer is on board, so maybe there's no legal issue. But the girlfriend's reaction is based on emotional hurt. Even if the man isn't in love anymore, the act of giving a large sum to an ex after an affair might be seen as crossing a line in the relationship with his current partner. Relationships typically require open communication about finances, especially when it comes to sharing with others. The girlfriend might feel that he's not being transparent or is showing favoritism to his ex, which is understandable because the ex is the mother of his children. \n\nHowever, the intention here is to help the kids and support the ex's well-being, which is commendable. The man is trying to make amends for his past mistakes, which could be seen as noble. But the problem arises in how he communicated this. Telling the girlfriend after making the decision could be a breach of trust. In a healthy relationship, major financial decisions involving others, especially an ex, should be discussed before being made. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that her partner didn't consider her feelings or the potential impact on their relationship. \n\nThe ex-wife's reaction isn't mentioned, but the man hasn't discussed it with her yet. The girlfriend's threat to break up if he goes through with it adds another layer. The man is relieved by these threats, which is a red flag. It suggests that he's more conflicted about the girlfriend's disapproval than about the act itself. \n\nOn one hand, the man is trying to do something good for the ex-wife and children. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected and possibly betrayed. The key factors here are the lack of communication and the girlfriend's emotional response. Even if the intention is good, the way it was handled (not consulting his current partner) could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the action was communicated properly and if the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Since he didn't talk to his girlfriend before deciding, and she's reacting strongly, he might be in the wrong for not being transparent. But if the primary goal is the well-being of the kids and the ex, maybe there's some justification. However, the ethical aspect here is about respecting the current partner's feelings. Without that communication, it's hard to say he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that the man's decision affects their relationship, which he should consider.\n"
