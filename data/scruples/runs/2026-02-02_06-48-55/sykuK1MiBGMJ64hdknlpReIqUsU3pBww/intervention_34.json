I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, despite his current girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, and they divorced six years ago because of his affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife handled the divorce amicably, allowing him to see the kids and keeping things civil. The man wants to give her the money as a gesture of appreciation and to help her out financially since she works a low-paying job. His girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and accused of him still being in love with the ex.\n\nNow, evaluating the morality here. On one hand, the man is trying to right past wrongs, showing gratitude towards his ex for being a good co-parent, and helping her financially. His parents and lawyer support him, which adds some weight. On the other hand, his girlfriend is upset because she feels this action is a betrayal, especially given the history of infidelity. The man also mentions that the ex-wife refuses to talk to his girlfriend, which might complicate things further.\n\nLegal aspects: The man is giving the money out of his own winnings, so unless there are legal restrictions (like if the money is shared property), he has the right to give it away. The ex-wife's acceptance of the money might be an issue if it affects her relationship with the girlfriend, but he hasn't discussed it yet.\n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels disrespected. Even if the man isn't in love with the ex, giving a large sum could be seen as prioritizing the ex over his current partner. The fact that he's considering going through with it despite her reaction might hurt her more, especially if the relationship is still ongoing.\n\nSocial norms might play a role here. While some might see the gesture as generous, others might think it's inappropriate to give such a gift without the current partner's consent, especially post-fidelity. The man's parents and lawyer being on board doesn't necessarily negate the emotional impact on his girlfriend.\n\nIn conclusion, while the man's intentions are noble, the act of giving a large sum to an ex without considering the current partner's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend has a right to feel hurt, and the man might be in the wrong for not prioritizing their relationship dynamics.\n"
