I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving a large amount of money from their lottery win to their ex-wife, despite their girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had an affair with their current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from their ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is described as amazing, and the author feels guilty for the affair. Now, after winning a large sum, they want to give some of it to the ex-wife as a gesture of appreciation for her being a good co-parent and mother.\n\nThe girlfriend is angry, thinks it's disrespectful, and accuses the author of still loving the ex. The author says they're not in love with the ex anymore but still love her for the kids' sake. The ex works a low-paying job, and the author wants to help her and the kids. The parents and lawyer support the idea.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? From a moral standpoint, maybe not. They're trying to make amends for past mistakes. However, ethically, giving a large sum to an ex without the current partner's input could be problematic. Financial decisions involving large amounts typically require mutual agreement. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because such a decision affects the relationship. The author hasn't discussed it with the girlfriend, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nBut then, the author's intentions are positive\u2014to support their kids and ex-wife. The ex-wife didn't expect or ask for it, but the author feels a sense of responsibility. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or undervalued. \n\nLegally, the money is the author's to do with as they please unless there's a legal obligation. Since they're in a different country, but generally, you can give money to whomever you want. However, relationship-wise, it's a different matter. The key issue is whether the author considered the girlfriend's feelings and discussed it. \n\nThe answer might hinge on context. If the author is in a committed relationship, making such a big financial decision without consulting the partner can be seen as neglecting their input. But the author's intent is to right past wrongs. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because it shows a lack of communication. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally but could be in the wrong relationally by not involving their girlfriend in such a significant decision.\n"
