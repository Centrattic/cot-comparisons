I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife despite the girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a large portion to his ex-wife, who he feels was wronged by his affair with the current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as being a good co-parent and has shown forgiveness despite the pain caused. The author hasn't discussed this with his girlfriend yet, and she's furious, seeing it as a betrayal and disrespect. The author feels relieved about the possible breakup, indicating some underlying issues in the current relationship.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The ex-wife is the mother of his children and they have a positive co-parenting relationship. The author's intention is to show appreciation and support, given her financial situation. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense, possibly because she feels disrespected or not considered. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is now in a new relationship, and the girlfriend is part of his current life. Giving a significant amount to an ex, especially after a harmful past action (the affair), could be seen as prioritizing the ex over the new partner. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex anymore, the girlfriend might feel neglected or that her worth is being undermined. Relationships often require consideration of each other's feelings, and the author might have overlooked that by not discussing the plan with his girlfriend first.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's relieved about the possible breakup. This could suggest that there are existing problems in the relationship with the girlfriend, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. He should have communicated his intentions and considered his girlfriend's perspective, especially since such a large financial decision affects their current partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention to support his ex-wife, who has been a good co-parent and endured significant pain from his infidelity, might be seen as a noble gesture. However, the way he's handling it\u2014without considering his girlfriend's feelings\u2014could be problematic. The key point is whether the author acted in a way that is respectful to both his current partner and his past.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual respect are crucial. By not consulting his girlfriend about such a major financial decision, the author may have caused unnecessary hurt. Even if his intentions are good, the execution might be flawed. The girlfriend's anger is a valid reaction because she might feel that her opinion matters in her partner's life, especially regarding financial commitments.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate towards his current partner's feelings, which makes him at least partly in the wrong. The decision to give the money without discussing it first with his girlfriend shows a lack of respect for her position in his current life.\n"
