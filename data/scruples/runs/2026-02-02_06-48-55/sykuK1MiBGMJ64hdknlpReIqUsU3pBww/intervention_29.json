I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend's anger. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife. The ex-wife is portrayed as being gracious, allowing co-parenting, and not being hostile. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to the ex-wife as a gesture of appreciation and to help her out financially. The girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author still loves the ex-wife. The author claims they don't love the ex-wife anymore but still appreciate her.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they're giving a large sum to an ex-spouse without consulting their current partner. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which could be a valid reaction. In relationships, major financial decisions usually involve mutual agreement. By not discussing this with the girlfriend first, the author might have breached trust or violated an unspoken boundary. The girlfriend's anger is not just about the money but about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing that the author hasn't fully moved on from the ex-wife.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to acknowledge the ex-wife's role as a mother and to support the kids. The ex-wife is described as gracious despite the past. However, the key point here is the decision to give the money without considering the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the action could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's threat to break up might indicate that this action is a deal-breaker for her, which the author should take seriously.\n\nThe author's parents and lawyer support the decision, but the girlfriend is the one directly affected in the current relationship. The author might need to recognize that their actions impact their current partner's trust and feelings. Even if the author's intention is good, the method of handling it (not discussing with the girlfriend first) is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and acted unilaterally on a significant financial decision.\n"
