I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author won millions and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as amazing and gave him the chance to stay close to their kids. The author feels he needs to do this to show he's not a complete mess, that he still cares, and to help her financially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support it, but his girlfriend is furious, accusing him of still loving the ex-wife, even though he says he's not in love with her anymore, just loves her for being a good co-parent.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's reasoning for the gift, the history with the ex-wife, the current relationship with his girlfriend, and the reactions from others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a legal standpoint, he's giving money to his ex-wife, which might not be an issue if it's his own money and there are no legal restrictions. Emotionally, he's trying to make amends, but the girlfriend is upset. The key here is the relationship between the author and his current girlfriend. If he had discussed this with her first, maybe the situation would be different. However, he didn't, which led to the conflict.\n\nMoral judgment is subjective. The author feels it's a personal choice to help his ex-wife, especially considering her past support. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel disrespected or neglected. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for his current partner's feelings. \n\nBut also, the ex-wife's role as the mother of his children adds another layer. Providing financial support for the kids could be justified, but the amount given and the manner in which it's done might matter. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that the author is prioritizing his past over his present relationship. \n\nThe author's parents and lawyer support him, which might indicate that from a family and legal perspective, it's acceptable. However, the girlfriend is the one directly affected in the current relationship. The author's decision to proceed without discussing it with her first is a point of contention. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the cultural or personal values of the situation. In some views, giving to an ex for the sake of children is understandable, but in others, it's about respecting the current partner's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all angles, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if his intentions are genuine, but his failure to communicate with his girlfriend could be seen as a mistake. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid as she might feel disrespected. The answer might be a mix of both perspectives, but since the user asks for a yes or no, I need to decide based on the most common viewpoint. In many cases, relationships require open communication, and the author's decision to proceed without that could be seen as the wrong move, even if his intentions are good. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the action is seen as a personal choice, then B. Hmm.\n"
