I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the guy won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which is causing conflict with his current girlfriend. The key points here are the history between the guy and his ex-wife, the current relationship status with his girlfriend, and the ethical implications of his actions.\n\nFirst, he had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce. The ex-wife is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives despite the hurt. Now, after winning the money, he wants to give her a large sum as a way to make up for his past mistakes. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking he still loves the ex-wife.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, does he have a responsibility to his ex-wife? He acknowledges his past wrongdoing and wants to make amends. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and he wants to improve her life. But his current relationship is suffering because of this decision. The question is whether giving money to an ex-spouse, especially for past wrongs, is appropriate when it causes conflict with the current partner.\n\nOne angle is that he's trying to right past wrongs, which is commendable. He's taking responsibility for his actions. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel neglected or that he's still emotionally tied to his ex-wife. The fact that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds another layer\u2014maybe there's ongoing tension there.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as excessive if the money is a way to help his children's mother. But then again, using the current partner as a secondary support system while prioritizing the ex-wife might not be fair. The girlfriend could feel that her feelings and the new relationship aren't being respected.\n\nI think the key here is whether the decision to give the money was made without the girlfriend's input. While he has the right to spend his money as he sees fit, the emotional impact on his current partner is significant. The girlfriend's anger stems from feeling disrespected, which is a valid emotion. However, the author's intention is to make amends, which is also a valid action. \n\nIt's a tough call. Legally, he can give the money, but ethically, it depends on the context. If the girlfriend feels that this is a major decision affecting their relationship and he didn't consider her feelings, then he might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if he's acting out of genuine remorse and the ex-wife deserves it, then he's not in the wrong. The fact that he hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet might also play a role\u2014maybe she would decline, or maybe she needs it. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to make amends for past mistakes, and the ex-wife is the mother of his children. However, the way he handled it with his girlfriend could be seen as insensitive. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the act of giving money to an ex-spouse for amends isn't inherently wrong, even if it causes issues with the current partner, the answer is B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here because he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more. However, the primary ethical consideration is his responsibility to his children and former spouse, so B might be the correct answer.\n"
