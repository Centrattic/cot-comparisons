I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. Now, he wants to give his ex a significant portion of his lottery winnings. His reasons include showing appreciation for her being a good co-parent, her financial situation, and wanting to make amends for his past mistakes.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and thinking he still loves his ex. He mentions that he doesn't plan to change his decision, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up. The author is seeking advice on whether he's at fault.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Financial Responsibility in Relationships**: Giving away a large sum of money to an ex might be seen as neglecting the current partner's needs or expectations. However, the ex was the mother of his children and a supportive co-parent. \n\n2. **Intentions vs. Perception**: The author's intent is to acknowledge his ex's sacrifices and improve their children's lives. However, the girlfriend might perceive this as preferential treatment or emotional attachment. \n\n3. **Communication Issues**: The author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first, which might have been a misstep. Even though he consulted his parents and lawyer, the girlfriend's feelings were overlooked. \n\n4. **Emotional Impact**: The ex is described as someone who handled the divorce gracefully. The gift could be seen as a form of atonement, but it might also complicate their current relationship dynamics.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: If the money is his to give (i.e., not part of shared assets), then it's his decision. However, in some jurisdictions, there might be implications if the girlfriend is a co-owner of the assets, but the author mentions the lawyer is on board, so maybe that's settled.\n\n6. **Partner's Reaction**: The girlfriend's anger is valid because unexpected financial decisions can feel like disrespect. Even if the author has good intentions, not involving his partner in such a major decision could be a breach of trust or consideration.\n\n7. **Personal Relationships**: The author's continued relationship with his ex as co-parents is positive, but giving money might blur boundaries or create expectations. The ex's refusal to talk to the girlfriend adds tension, but that's part of their existing dynamic.\n\nWeighing these factors, the author's primary wrong might be not communicating with his girlfriend about such a significant financial decision. While his intentions towards the ex are commendable, the way he handled it with his current partner could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected are valid because financial decisions, especially large ones, often require mutual discussion in a relationship. Even if the author feels it's the right thing to do, not involving his partner in the decision-making process can be a point of contention. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and not discussing the matter with her first. However, the act of giving the money itself might be justified by his reasons, but the method of handling it is questionable.\n"
