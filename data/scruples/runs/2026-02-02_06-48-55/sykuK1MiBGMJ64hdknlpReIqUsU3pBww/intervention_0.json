I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend being angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. Now, he wants to give his ex a significant portion of his lottery win. His reasons are that she's a good mother, he feels guilty for the affair, and he wants to help her financially. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex.\n\nFrom the ex-wife's perspective, she was wronged in the divorce. The author had an affair, which is a serious betrayal. Now he's giving her money, which might be seen as a way to make amends. But the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend, which could mean she's not ready to let go of the past. The author might be trying to do the right thing by helping her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected. She might see this gift as a sign that he still has emotional ties to his ex-wife, even if he claims it's just about the kids and guilt. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first, that could be a problem. He might have considered his ex-wife's needs, but the girlfriend's feelings were also valid. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author wrong anyone by making this gift? The ex-wife might appreciate it, but the girlfriend feels betrayed. Was the author obligated to consult his girlfriend? In a relationship, major financial decisions that affect the partner's feelings should be discussed. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if he didn't consider how it would impact his current partner. Even if his intentions are good, the way he handled it without her input might be the issue.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong not because of giving the money, but because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend. Relationships need mutual respect and transparency. Even if he believes he's doing the right thing by helping his ex-wife, he should have talked to his girlfriend first to explain his reasons and see how she felt. Her reaction shows that this decision has significant emotional implications for their relationship. Therefore, the author's mistake was not involving his girlfriend in the decision-making process, leading to her feeling disrespected and possibly causing unnecessary conflict.\n"
