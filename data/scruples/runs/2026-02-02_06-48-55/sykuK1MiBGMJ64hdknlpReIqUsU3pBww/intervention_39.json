I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money they won, despite their girlfriend being angry. Their ex is the mother of their kids, and they had a messy divorce because of an affair with their current girlfriend. Now, the author wants to give the ex money to help her out financially and as a way to show they care. The girlfriend is upset and might break up, but the author feels relieved.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are the relationship dynamics. The author cheated on their ex-wife with their current girlfriend. They divorced six years ago, but the ex allowed a smooth co-parenting situation. Now, they want to give her a significant amount of money. The girlfriend is angry, thinking it's a sign the author still loves the ex, which he denies. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They mention they still love their ex-wife but not in a romantic way. They want to help her financially because she works a low-paying job and to show they care. The lawyer and parents support this. But the girlfriend doesn't like it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, the girlfriend might feel disrespected or that the author is prioritizing the ex. Even if the author doesn't have romantic feelings, giving a large sum could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for the current partner's feelings. However, the author's intention is to help the ex's financial situation and co-parenting, which could be seen as a positive act.\n\nBut, in terms of the current relationship, did the author consult the girlfriend before making this decision? It seems like they didn't, which could be a big factor. Even if the motivation is good, not discussing it with the girlfriend might come off as dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction shows that this is a significant issue for her, possibly because it brings up past hurts or insecurity about the relationship's future.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions feeling relieved about the breakup threats. That could indicate underlying issues in the relationship. However, the main question is about the act of giving the money. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might be perceived as emotionally or financially irresponsible in the context of their current relationship. The ex-wife is entitled to support for the children, but giving more than necessary could be seen as favoritism or a lack of boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife's situation (working a low-paying job) might justify the help, especially if the author feels a moral obligation. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid too. It's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. However, considering that the author didn't discuss this with their girlfriend and the girlfriend's feelings are hurt, perhaps the author is in the wrong for not respecting their partner's feelings. The decision to give the money without consulting the girlfriend shows a lack of consideration for the current relationship's impact. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
