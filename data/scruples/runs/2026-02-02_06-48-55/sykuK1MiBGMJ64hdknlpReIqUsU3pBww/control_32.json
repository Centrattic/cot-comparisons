I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which his girlfriend is upset about. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and they had a divorce six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. He feels guilty about the affair and wants to make amends by giving her money. The ex-wife is portrayed as being forgiving and cooperative in co-parenting despite his mistake. The author still loves her, but clarifies he's not in love with her anymore.\n\nHe hasn't discussed this with his ex-wife yet, but his parents and lawyer support him. However, his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with his ex. The main question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to give the money.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, wanting to help the mother of his children could be seen as a positive act, especially since she's in a low-paying job. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The act of giving a large sum without discussing it with his current partner might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Financial decisions involving such large sums usually require communication and mutual agreement, especially in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a duty as a parent to support his children, and providing for the ex-wife could indirectly benefit the kids. The fact that the ex-wife is a good co-parent supports this. But the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly feeling that the author hasn't considered her perspective in this decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to do something good for his ex-wife and kids, but his actions may have disregarded his girlfriend's feelings. The key issue is communication. If he had discussed this with his girlfriend before making the decision, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since he didn't, and she's upset, it's a problem. However, his intentions are to support his children and make amends, which is commendable. The girlfriend's anger might be more about feeling left out of a major financial decision rather than the act itself.\n\nIn relationships, partners often expect to be involved in major financial decisions, even if they aren't legally required. So, while the author's motives are good, not involving his girlfriend could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not communicating with her, even if the action itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
