I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about someone who won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife, which upsets their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The man had an affair with his current partner, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. Now, the ex is close to the kids and has been a good co-parent. He wants to give her money as a way of showing gratitude and making amends. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her or still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man's intentions, the girlfriend's reaction, and the ethical considerations of giving money to an ex. The ex is a good co-parent, and the money would help her improve her life. He hasn't told the ex yet but discussed it with his parents and lawyer. The girlfriend is threatening to break up because of this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give, then he can do so. But emotionally, the girlfriend might feel betrayed. Even if the man isn't in love with the ex anymore, giving such a large sum could be seen as prioritizing past relationships over current ones. There's also the issue of the affair\u2014the man's past mistake caused the divorce. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex is the mother of his children, and showing her care and support might be justified. The man is using the money to help her improve her life, which is a positive action. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because financial decisions involving ex-partners can be sensitive. The man didn't consult his girlfriend, which could be a point against him. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a grey area. The man's intentions are good, but the way he's handling it without considering his current partner's feelings might be problematic. The girlfriend's anger is about feeling disrespected, and even if the man isn't in love with the ex, the action could undermine the trust in the current relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's debatable. Since the question is about being in the wrong in a social context, the answer might hinge on the impact on the current relationship versus the ex's needs. Given that the girlfriend is threatening to break up, the man's action is causing significant conflict. Even if his intentions are good, not considering his girlfriend's perspective could be seen as a mistake. So, maybe answer A (Yes), but there's a case for B too. However, the common advice in such situations is to communicate and consider current relationships' feelings. Since he didn't consult his girlfriend, he's in the wrong. So, A.\n"
