I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery, which causes conflict with the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had an affair with his current partner, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife. Now, after winning a substantial amount of money, he wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, who he still has affection for but isn't in love with. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of still loving the ex. He's considering going through with it despite her anger.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether giving money to an ex-wife is wrong, especially when the current partner is upset. Let's consider different angles. Legally, if the money is his to give, he can do so, right? But emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. The ex-wife is a good co-parent, and he wants to show his appreciation. However, his girlfriend's feelings are hurt, and he might be risking the relationship.\n\nOn one hand, he's trying to make amends and help his children's mother, which is noble. On the other, his girlfriend might feel neglected or not respected if he gives money to an ex without discussion. The fact that he hasn't discussed it with his ex yet but has with his parents and lawyer suggests he's considering legal and family opinions, but maybe not the emotional impact on his current partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, which might indicate deeper trust issues or insecurity. The author feels relieved by the breakup threats, which is concerning because it shows he might be prioritizing his wants over the relationship's stability. However, he also has a duty toward his children, and supporting their mother could be in their best interest.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a moral dilemma. Legally, he's not in the wrong if it's his money. Ethically, it's more about the impact on relationships. If the girlfriend feels disrespected, giving the money could be seen as dismissing her feelings. But if the ex-widow deserves the support and it's for the children's benefit, it's justified. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's justification is valid. He claims it's not about still loving her but showing care. However, the girlfriend's perspective is crucial. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. By not discussing it with his girlfriend, he might have breached trust, even if his intentions are good. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on balancing personal responsibility towards ex-spouse and current partner's feelings. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a case for both sides. If he proceeds without considering his girlfriend's perspective, he could be seen as inconsiderate. However, his actions towards his children's mother might be seen as responsible. \n\nBut since the question is about being in the wrong, and the girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected, the author's decision might be seen as neglecting the current relationship's needs. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (wrong) for not considering the current partner's feelings, even if his intentions are good.\n"
