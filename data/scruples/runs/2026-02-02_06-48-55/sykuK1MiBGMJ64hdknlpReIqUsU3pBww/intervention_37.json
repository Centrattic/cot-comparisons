I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person won a large sum and wants to give a significant amount to their ex-wife. The ex-wife is described as good and supportive, even after the affair with the current girlfriend. The author feels a sense of obligation to her because she's the mother of their kids and he wants to make amends for his past mistakes.\n\nThe main issue here is the conflict with the current girlfriend. The girlfriend is angry and feels disrespected, thinking the author is still in love with the ex-wife. The author clarifies they aren't in love but still care as a co-parent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by giving the money despite the girlfriend's anger.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author's lawyer is on board, so there's no legal issue. The parents support it too. But relationships often involve more than just legality. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because sudden large financial gestures to an ex can be seen as emotionally significant. Even if the author isn't in love, the act might be perceived as a betrayal of trust. The girlfriend's feelings matter here; her reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing emotional neglect or commitment issues.\n\nThe author's intention is noble\u2014to help his children's mother and correct past wrongs. However, not considering the girlfriend's perspective and feelings could be a mistake. Communication is key in relationships, and involving the girlfriend in the decision-making process would have been better. The author's relief at the girlfriend's breakup threats also suggests underlying issues in their relationship, which might indicate that the decision isn't just about the ex-wife but also about the current relationship dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the way he handled the situation without considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential emotional impact might make him at fault. The act of giving money to the ex-wife without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust in their current relationship.\n"
