I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of their kids, and they divorced because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The author feels they need to do this as a way to show they care and to help the ex-wife, who works a low-paying job. The girlfriend is upset and threatening to break up, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author still loves the ex-wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention is to make amends, but they didn't consult their current partner. That's a big red flag. Even if the author has good intentions, involving a significant financial decision without discussing it with their partner could be seen as disrespectful. Relationships require communication, especially when it comes to major life decisions that affect both partners. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because this is a substantial amount of money, and she might feel that her partner is prioritizing someone from their past over their current relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife is the mother of their children and has been handling the divorce with grace. The author might feel a sense of responsibility towards her and the kids. But the key issue here is the lack of communication with the current partner. The author's actions could be perceived as betraying the trust of the girlfriend, especially since the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend. This situation might also complicate the co-parenting dynamic if the ex-wife and the girlfriend can't get along.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. Giving away a large portion of the winnings could impact the author's and their partner's future. The girlfriend might be worried about financial security and feel that the author isn't considering their shared future. The author's parents and lawyer being on board isn't a substitute for the girlfriend's input, especially since they're in a romantic relationship now.\n\nThe author's lawyer was surprised but on board, so there's no legal issue. The main problem is emotional and relational. The author's decision to give the money might be seen as a personal choice, but in a relationship, major decisions should involve mutual discussion. The girlfriend's anger is valid because she's part of the present and future of the author's life now. The author might have good intentions, but not involving the girlfriend in such a big decision is a breach of trust and communication.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their current partner about a significant financial decision that affects both of them. The girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship are important factors here. Even if the ex-wife deserves help, the way the author is handling it without discussing it with their current partner is where the mistake lies.\n"
