I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife after winning the lottery, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from different angles. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is described as a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping things amicable. The author wants to give her a significant sum because she works a low-paying job and he feels it's a way to show he cares, even after his mistakes. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex-wife.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the money is his to do with as he pleases, right? He's not legally obligated to give it to his ex unless there's a prenuptial agreement or child support involved. Since they're divorced, he isn't required to give her money. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, so he might feel a paternal obligation to help them both. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. She might feel that giving his ex-wife money is a betrayal, especially considering the past affair. But the author says he's not in love with her anymore, just loves her as a parent and co-parent.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for conflict between the author and his girlfriend. If the girlfriend is threatening to break up over this, it shows that their relationship has issues. The author's decision might be seen as a personal choice, but if he's in a committed relationship now, he should consider his partner's feelings. However, he hasn't discussed it with the ex-wife yet, only with his parents and lawyer. Maybe he should have involved the girlfriend in the decision-making process to avoid hurt feelings.\n\nBut on the other hand, the ex-wife's situation is legitimate. She's working a low-paying job and the author might feel guilty from the past. Using his winnings to help her could be seen as a noble gesture. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since there's no legal obligation, it's more about moral and relationship boundaries.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's debatable. The author is using his money to help someone who was wronged by him. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, the girlfriend might feel hurt, but that's about their relationship dynamics. The author might need to explain his reasoning more clearly to his girlfriend, but the act itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
