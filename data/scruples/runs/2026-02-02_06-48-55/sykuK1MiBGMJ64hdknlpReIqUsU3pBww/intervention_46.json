I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing in giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man won a significant amount of money, around millions. He wants to give a large portion to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as kind and has been a good co-parent. He didn't mention the amount to his girlfriend yet, but she found out and is upset, accusing him of still loving his ex. He's considering going through with it anyway, and his parents and lawyer agree.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, giving money to his ex-wife, especially for the kids' benefit and her financial situation, might be seen as a noble gesture. He's trying to make amends for his past mistake (the affair) and ensure the kids have a good life. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so the money could help her pursue hobbies and provide for the kids better.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because he didn't discuss this with her. She feels disrespected and believes he's still in love with his ex. Even if he's not, not consulting his current partner about such a big decision could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships often require communication about major financial decisions, especially when it involves a significant amount of money and an ex-partner.\n\nHis parents and lawyer support him, which might validate his decision from a legal and family perspective. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about emotional respect and transparency. By not involving her in the decision-making process, he might be prioritizing his feelings towards his ex over his current relationship. The fact that he's \"relieved\" by her breakup threats is concerning because it shows he's not considering her feelings adequately.\n\nSo, the key points are: the ex-wife is being given money for practical reasons, but the girlfriend's feelings are hurt due to lack of communication and perceived disrespect. Legally and morally, he might have a case, but in terms of relationship ethics, he might have a responsibility to his current partner. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether giving the money was a personal decision that should have included his partner. Since he didn't discuss it with her and she's now upset, it's possible he's in the wrong for not being transparent. Even if his intentions are good, the way he handled it could be problematic. So, he might be in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
