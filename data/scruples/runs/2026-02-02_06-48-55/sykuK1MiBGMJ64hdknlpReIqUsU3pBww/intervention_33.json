I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife, despite the girlfriend's anger, makes the author at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man won a large amount of money, around millions. He wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, the mother of his children. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as a saint, handling the divorce amicably for the kids' sake. He feels he needs to do this as a gesture of appreciation for her past behavior and to help her financially since she works a low-paying job.\n\nHis girlfriend is furious, thinks he's still in love with the ex, and threatens to break up. The author feels relieved but still plans to go through with giving the money. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the ex-wife is the mother of his children and handled the divorce well. The man might feel a sense of duty or gratitude. On the other hand, his girlfriend is his current partner, and he's about to make a major financial decision without her input, which could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. Even if he's not in love with the ex-wife, giving her a large sum could be perceived as giving preferential treatment over his current partner.\n\nLegal aspects might be on his side since the lawyer approved, but the emotional impact on his girlfriend is significant. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because such a decision affects their relationship and financial future. Even if the author's intentions are good, the action might be seen as selfish or disrespectful to his current partner.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is relieved by the girlfriend's threats suggests he might have mixed feelings or unresolved issues. However, the ex-wife's role as a co-parent is important. The key points are the context of the relationship with the ex and the girlfriend's reaction. The author didn't consult his girlfriend, which is a problem in a relationship, especially with such a big decision. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he made a decision that affects his current partner without discussing it, regardless of good intentions.\n"
