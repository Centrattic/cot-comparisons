I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he won a large sum of money, and he wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, the mother of his kids. The ex-wife is described as a saintly figure who allowed a pain-free divorce despite his affair with the current girlfriend. The girlfriend is angry and threatening to break up because she feels disrespected. The author is considering going through with the plan regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author is the parent of the children, so he has a responsibility towards them, and the ex-wife is their mother. Giving money to her might be seen as helping co-parenting, but is it his decision alone? If the money is his, he can technically do with it as he pleases. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend isn't a legal stakeholder in the children's upbringing. The ex-wife is the mother, so her role is more legally and emotionally tied to the kids. The author is trying to make amends, which is commendable, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid because they are in a relationship. The author didn't consult her before making this decision, which could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. However, the ex-wife was the first person he called, but the author didn't mention discussing the money gift with her yet. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife is portrayed as having handled the divorce gracefully, so the author's gesture might be seen as a way to show appreciation. But the girlfriend's reaction is about the emotional impact. The author mentions that the girlfriend is threatening to break up, and he feels relieved. That might indicate some unresolved issues in the relationship, but the main question is whether giving the money is wrong.\n\nLegally, the author can give the money, but ethically, in a relationship, major financial decisions that involve ex-partners can be problematic. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing his ex over her. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the girlfriend might interpret it as a betrayal. The author's intention is to help the ex-wife and the kids, but the method might be causing harm in the current relationship.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. He might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, by not discussing the decision with his girlfriend, he's causing conflict. However, there's also the argument that the ex-wife is the mother of his children and deserves support. The answer might depend on the balance between these factors. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could be A (wrong) because he didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings, but also B (not wrong) because he's helping his ex and children. But since he chose to do it without consulting the girlfriend, which led to conflict, maybe A is more appropriate.\n"
