I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author won a large sum of money, millions. They want to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their kids. They divorced six years ago because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife was hurt but handled things amicably, allowing co-parenting and maintaining a respectful relationship. The author feels guilty for the affair and wants to show the ex-wife they care by giving her money, to help her financially and as a gesture of goodwill. The current girlfriend is furious, thinks it's disrespectful, accuses the author of still loving the ex-wife, and is threatening to break up. The author is considering going through with it and is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ex-wife situation. The author's ex-wife is a parent to their children, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. The author feels a sense of responsibility to provide for the kids and maybe to make amends for past mistakes. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so the money could improve her life. The author's parents and lawyer support the idea, which adds some validation from others.\n\nOn the other hand, the current girlfriend is upset. She feels disrespected because the author is giving money to an ex, even though they acknowledge they're not in love with the ex anymore. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, suggesting that this gesture might be crossing a line in their current relationship. The author is considering going through with the gift despite this, which could lead to a breakup.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the ex-wife is the mother of their children, and there's a financial aspect for co-parenting. It's common for parents to consider their children's well-being when making financial decisions. However, giving a large sum of money to an ex-spouse might be seen as a separate issue from child support or shared expenses. The author is doing it out of guilt and a desire to make amends, which is understandable, but the current partner's feelings are also valid. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing past relationships over their current one, leading to trust issues.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't discussed this with the ex-wife yet. They just plan to give the money, which could be a surprise. That might not be respectful to the ex-wife either. Maybe the ex-wife didn't expect or want the money, even though she was happy to hear about the win. The author's intentions are good, but the method might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the affair was the author's fault, which led to the divorce. The current relationship is based on the fact that the author had an affair. The girlfriend's insecurity here is understandable. If the author gives the ex-wife a large amount of money without considering the partner's feelings, it could be seen as dismissing her concerns. However, the author's motivation is to support the kids and help the ex-wife, which is a separate issue from the relationship with the current partner.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, the lawyer is on board, so maybe it's not a legal issue. But emotionally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. The author might be in a position where their actions are causing harm to their current relationship. While the intention is positive towards the ex-wife and children, the impact on the current partner is negative. The author needs to balance these responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend is the current partner, her feelings matter. The author's decision affects their current relationship. Even if the action is well-intentioned, not considering the partner's perspective could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be in the wrong morally towards the ex-wife, but in terms of the current relationship, they might be neglecting their partner's feelings. Therefore, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because they are causing harm in their current relationship by not respecting the partner's feelings, even with good intentions towards the ex.\n"
