I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he won a large sum of money and decided to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which upset his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had an affair with his current partner, which caused the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is described as still being a good co-parent despite the pain. The author feels he wants to make amends by giving her money, but his girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and thinking he still has feelings for the ex.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intention to show appreciation and make amends to his ex, the girlfriend's reaction, and whether the author's actions are justified. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that supporting his ex-wife is a way to acknowledge her past sacrifices and help their children. His parents and lawyer support him, which suggests some level of validation. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she might perceive the gesture as a betrayal or a lack of commitment to the current relationship. \n\nBut did the author consult his girlfriend before making this decision? The answer is no. He only discussed it with his parents and lawyer. That's a problem. In a current relationship, especially involving significant financial decisions, communication is key. Even if the ex is a co-parent, giving her a large sum without discussing it with the new partner can be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's anger is a reaction to being excluded from this decision, which affects their financial dynamics. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not in love with the ex anymore, but still loves her for the kids. However, the girlfriend might feel that the emotional ties are still strong, leading to insecurity. The author's relief at her threats to break up adds another layer, indicating possible unresolved issues in their relationship.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might be noble, the way he handled it is problematic. The main issue is not informing his girlfriend about such a significant decision that impacts their shared finances and emotional well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the implications of his actions on their relationship.\n"
