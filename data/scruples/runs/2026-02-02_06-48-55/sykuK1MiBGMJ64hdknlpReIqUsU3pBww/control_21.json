I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, which has upset their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author has for giving the money. They mention that the ex-wife is the mother of their children and that they feel it's a way to show they're not a complete \"fuck up.\" They also note that the ex-wife works a low-paying job and this might help her pursue her hobbies. The author is still in contact with the ex-wife and says she's been a saint during the divorce, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives despite the affair.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves the ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with her anymore, but still loves her as a co-parent and mother. The girlfriend is threatening to break up, and the author feels relieved about that.\n\nSo, the question is whether giving the money to the ex-wife makes the author at fault. Legally, the author is giving money to someone else, but since it's his own money, he might have the right to do so. However, relationships often involve trust and communication. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, especially since the author's past affair caused the divorce. Even if the ex-wife is a good co-parent, the girlfriend's feelings about the financial gesture could be hurt or feel like a betrayal.\n\nBut the author's intentions seem genuine: supporting the ex-wife's well-being and the kids. The ex-wife was already supportive, and others like the parents and lawyer approved. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, and the author isn't hiding his feelings for the ex-wife but is trying to make amends.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's tricky. The author isn't forced to give the money, but they choose to because of their past actions and current relationship with the ex-wife. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to help someone who's been good to their kids and has a valid financial need. However, the author might have a responsibility to their current partner to consider her feelings more, perhaps discussing it before making the decision. But since the money is his, and the ex-wife's situation is valid, maybe it's not wrong.\n\nSo, leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intentions are good and the money is his to give. But there's a balance between personal responsibility to the ex-wife and the current relationship. But the key here is that the author isn't legally or ethically bound to consult the girlfriend, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
