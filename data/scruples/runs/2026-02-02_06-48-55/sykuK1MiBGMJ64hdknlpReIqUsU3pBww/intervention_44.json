I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author won a significant amount, around millions. He wants to give his ex-wife a substantial portion. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and he left her for his current girlfriend. She was very gracious during the divorce, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives. The girlfriend is furious, accusing him of still loving the ex and disrespecting her. The author says he still loves the ex for being a good co-parent but isn't in love with her anymore.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, when does giving money to an ex-wife become problematic in a current relationship? The ex-wife is the mother of his children, so there's a legal and emotional responsibility there. The author feels he needs to compensate her for past wrongs and to help her and the kids. However, the girlfriend is hurt and sees this as a betrayal.\n\nLegal aspects: The author consulted his lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So maybe there's no legal issue here. The money is his to give, unless there are specific alimony or child support obligations. But since the ex-wife works a low-paying job, maybe he's trying to help her financially beyond legal requirements.\n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend is in a new relationship where the partner is giving a significant amount to the ex. Even if it's for good reasons, could it be seen as disrespectful to the current partner? The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing his past relationship over the current one, especially since the divorce was his fault. The author might not see it that way, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend. This adds another layer. By giving money to the ex-wife, is the author indirectly supporting a relationship that excludes his current partner? It might make the girlfriend feel further alienated.\n\nThe author's intentions are good\u2014trying to make amends and help his ex-wife and kids. But the context of the current relationship is important. The girlfriend is his partner now, and major financial decisions involving an ex could strain trust and mutual respect. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the act of giving a large sum might be perceived as a betrayal of trust in the current relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author didn't consult the girlfriend about this decision, which is a problem. Even if he feels justified, not discussing such a significant financial move with his partner could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's anger is a valid reaction to being kept in the dark about such an important decision.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are noble, the way he's handling the situation could be considered wrong from the girlfriend's perspective. It's a matter of respect and communication within the current relationship. The author might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically and emotionally, he's causing harm to his current partner, which is a significant issue.\n"
