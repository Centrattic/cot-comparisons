I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset about this, thinking he's being disrespectful to her and maybe still in love with the ex. The author says he's not in love with the ex anymore but still loves her as a parent and wants to help her out because she works a low-paying job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author cheated on his ex-wife with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce. Now, he's trying to give money to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is portrayed as a good co-parent and a saint for allowing him to see the kids despite the betrayal. The author's intentions are to show he's not a complete failure and to help her financially. But his girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected, especially if the ex-wife refuses to talk to her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, giving money to an ex-wife, especially after a divorce that involved cheating, could be seen as a sensitive matter. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because it might feel like the author is prioritizing his ex-wife over his current relationship. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex-wife, the act of giving a large sum without the girlfriend's input could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the current relationship. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's intention is to acknowledge his past mistakes and support his children's mother. The ex-wife's financial situation is poor compared to the author's new wealth. However, the key point here is that the author is in a current relationship, and major financial decisions involving an ex should ideally be discussed with the current partner. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that her partner isn't considering her feelings or the impact on their relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds another layer. If the author is giving money to the ex-wife, it might create tension in his current relationship if the ex-wife isn't accepting of the girlfriend. The author's parents and lawyer support him, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right in the eyes of the current partner. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual respect are crucial. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before making this decision, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's threat to break up is a strong reaction, but her feelings are valid in this context. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might be careless regarding the current relationship dynamics. \n\nTherefore, even if the author's intentions are good, the act of giving a large amount of money to an ex-wife without discussing it with his current girlfriend could be considered inconsiderate. The wrong here might lie in not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
