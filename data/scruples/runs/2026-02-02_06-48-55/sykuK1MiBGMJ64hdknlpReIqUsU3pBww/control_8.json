I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery, which causes conflict with the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with the current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from the ex-wife. The ex is described as a saint, allowing the author to see the kids and keeping the divorce amicable. Now, the author wants to give her a significant amount of money from the lottery winnings. The girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected and accused the author of still loving the ex.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The ex is the mother of their children, and the author feels a sense of responsibility or guilt from the past. The money is intended as a way to make amends. But the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and the author's current relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for giving the ex money? Well, the ex is entitled to whatever the author decides to give, especially since they have children together. The author hasn't done anything illegal here. The girlfriend's reaction is about emotional pain and jealousy. However, the author's actions might be seen as unfair to the current partner if they haven't discussed or agreed on financial decisions. \n\nBut the author hasn't given the money yet and is discussing it with others. The girlfriend's threat to break up is a relationship issue. The question is whether the author's plan is wrong. Legally, no. Morally, it's complex. The ex is a parent, so supporting the children's well-being is a justifiable reason. However, the girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing past obligations over current relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to support their children's mother, especially if it's for their benefit. However, the approach might not have considered the current partner's feelings, which is a relational issue. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the action is unethical. The author's intention is to make amends for past mistakes, which is understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a caveat about relational communication issues.\n"
