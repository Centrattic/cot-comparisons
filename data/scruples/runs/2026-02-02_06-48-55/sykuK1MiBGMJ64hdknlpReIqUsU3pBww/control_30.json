I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife, despite his girlfriend's anger. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex is described as a good person, and the author feels a sense of responsibility towards their kids. The ex works a low-paying job, and he wants to help her out. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he still loves the ex.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention to do something noble for his ex, the girlfriend's reaction, and the context of the divorce. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by proceeding with this plan despite the girlfriend's disapproval.\n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, he can probably do it. Emotionally, though, it's a relationship issue. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or that he's not valuing her feelings. The author argues he's not in love with the ex but still loves her for the kids. But the girlfriend might see this as a betrayal or that he's not over her.\n\nIt's important to consider both perspectives. The author's gesture is well-intentioned, but relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he didn't consult his girlfriend beforehand, that could be a problem. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Disregarding her emotions could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the gift is perceived as showing more affection to the ex than to the current partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe he's doing the right thing by supporting his children's mother and acknowledging past wrongs. But in a new relationship, such actions can create tension. The fact that the girlfriend is threatening to break up suggests that this issue is significant for her. The author's relief at her threats complicates things, indicating possible unresolved issues in their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on intentions and communication. If he made the decision without discussing it with his girlfriend and she feels disrespected, then he might be at fault for not considering her feelings. However, if he's acting out of genuine care for his children's well-being and past mistakes, his intentions are good. But in relationships, actions that affect the partner's feelings should be discussed. Therefore, the author's decision to proceed without her input might be seen as wrong, even if the act itself is noble. The answer could be A (yes, he's wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's feelings and the relationship dynamics.\n"
