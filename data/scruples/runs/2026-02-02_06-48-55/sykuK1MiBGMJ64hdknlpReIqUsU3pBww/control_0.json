I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from their lottery winnings, despite their girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, the user won a significant amount of money. They've been divorced for six years because the user had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as a good person who handled the divorce gracefully, allowing the user to stay in their kids' lives. The user wants to give her a significant sum to show appreciation and help her out, as she works a low-paying job. They've discussed it with their parents and lawyer, who agree. The girlfriend is furious, thinks it's disrespectful and that the user still loves the ex-wife. The user isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the user's intentions. They want to help their ex-wife and kids, and they've already taken steps to formalize it with their lawyer. Their girlfriend is upset over jealousy or feeling disrespected. The user feels relieved that the girlfriend is threatening to break up because they might have issues with the decision.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the user has the right to give away the money (assuming it's their own winnings), then they can do so. Morally, it's a bit more complex. The user's ex-wife is the mother of their children, and providing support could be seen as a responsible act. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests there's tension here. The user might be in a position where their actions are legally and ethically justified if the ex-wife benefits from it and the money is rightfully theirs to give. The girlfriend's anger could stem from feeling that the user is prioritizing the ex-wife over her in a personal matter, even if the user's reasons are noble.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? If they're supporting their children and ex-spouse appropriately, perhaps not. However, involving the current partner in such a major decision might be important for maintaining trust. The user didn't consult the girlfriend, which led to conflict. But since the money isn't being given to the ex-wife in a romantic context, but rather as a financial gesture for the kids and her betterment, it might be justified. The girlfriend's reaction could be an issue if she feels her partner isn't respecting her feelings by making such a unilateral decision. However, the user's actions are towards the well-being of their children and former spouse, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's intentions are positive, and unless there are legal issues with the money, they might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is a personal issue, but the act itself seems ethically sound. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
