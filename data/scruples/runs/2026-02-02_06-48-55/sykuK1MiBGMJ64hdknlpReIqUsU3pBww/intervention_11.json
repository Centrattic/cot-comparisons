I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money he won, despite his girlfriend being angry about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large portion to his ex-wife, who he divorced six years ago after an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as being kind and cooperative during the divorce, even though she's still hurting and doesn't talk to his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accusing him of still loving the ex-wife.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check. I need to weigh the arguments. On one hand, the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and he wants to support her and the kids. He's also given his parents and lawyer the okay. On the other hand, the current girlfriend feels disrespected and is threatening to break up because of this decision.\n\nIs there a legal issue? The man is giving the money to his ex-wife. If the money is his to give, then legally he can do that. But maybe there are other factors, like if the money is from a joint account or if there's a prenuptial agreement. However, the scenario doesn't mention that. The lawyer's surprising but being on board suggests that it's legally permissible.\n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend is feeling hurt and disrespected. The man says he's not in love with the ex-wife anymore, but he still cares for her as a co-parent. The girlfriend might feel that this act undermines their relationship, especially since the affair was a past mistake. The man's actions could be seen as not respecting his current partner's feelings.\n\nCommunication is key here. Did he consult with his girlfriend about this decision? If he made this decision without her input, that could be a problem. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Even if he has other people's support, his partner's feelings matter. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her partner is giving preferential treatment to his ex, which can create resentment.\n\nBut then again, supporting the children's mother is a valid reason. However, the man might have a responsibility to his current partner's well-being too. The fact that he feels relieved by her breakup threat complicates things. It suggests that maybe he's not as invested in the relationship, which could be a red flag.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the money is his to give and there's no legal issue, perhaps not. But ethically, in terms of the relationship with his girlfriend, he might be. He didn't consider her feelings before making such a significant decision. The girlfriend's reaction shows that this is a major issue for her, and not discussing it could be a breach of trust or respect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the man's intentions might be good, the way he handled the situation\u2014without considering his girlfriend's perspective\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. So, he might be in the wrong.\n"
