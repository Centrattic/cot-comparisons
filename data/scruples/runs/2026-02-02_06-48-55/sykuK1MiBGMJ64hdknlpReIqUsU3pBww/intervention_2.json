I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend being angry about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author won a significant sum (millions) from the lottery. He plans to give a large amount to his ex-wife, who is his kids' mother. The divorce was six years ago due to his affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as having handled the divorce gracefully, prioritizing the kids and maintaining a respectful relationship. The author mentions he still loves her but clarifies he's not in love. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accusing him of still being in love.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main issue is whether it's appropriate to give a large sum to an ex-spouse without the current partner's knowledge or approval. Financial gifts between partners are a big deal because they involve shared resources, even if the money is personal. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because such a gift could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if they are in a committed relationship. The author's lawyer and parents support him, but that's not the point; the focus is on the relationship with his girlfriend.\n\nThe author's intention is to show appreciation for his ex-wife's role in the kids' lives and to help her financially. However, the girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship are crucial. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the girlfriend might feel neglected or that her relationship is undervalued. The fact that the ex-wife refuses to talk to his girlfriend adds another layer of tension. The author might not realize how this gift could exacerbate those feelings or be perceived as favoring the ex over his current partner.\n\nIn many relationships, big financial decisions without mutual discussion can lead to conflict. The girlfriend's anger could stem from feeling that her partner is not being transparent or is still emotionally tied to his ex, even if that's not the case. The author's relief at her threat to break up might indicate he's aware of the relationship's issues, but the act itself could still be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, while the author's motives are good, the execution might be problematic. It's about respecting the current partner's feelings and the boundaries of the new relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not including his girlfriend in this decision.\n"
