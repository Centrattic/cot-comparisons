I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger. The answer needs to be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The man won a significant amount of money, and he wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as saint-like, handling the divorce gracefully and being a good co-parent. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with the ex. \n\nThe key points here are: the man's intention to give money to his ex-wife as a gesture of appreciation and to help her, considering her sacrifices and the ex's current financial situation. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious and threatening to break up. He's conflicted but plans to go through with it.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Is he in the wrong? Well, he's not legally obligated to give her money. The ex-wife isn't his responsibility anymore financially, unless there are child support obligations. He's giving it as a gift, which is his right. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly the man's emotional attachment to the ex. \n\nThe man argues he's not in love with the ex, just respecting her role as a mother. But the girlfriend's perception is that he's still emotionally connected. The man's decision might be seen as a personal choice, but relationships often involve mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is part of his current life, giving a large sum to a former spouse without her consent could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nHowever, the man isn't legally or ethically bound to consult his girlfriend before making donations or gifts. The question is whether his action is wrong in the context of their relationship. If the girlfriend feels disrespected, maybe the man should have discussed it with her. But the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and the man's desire to acknowledge her past sacrifices might be valid. \n\nThe answer hinges on balancing personal ethics with relational dynamics. If the girlfriend is part of his life, causing her distress without a compelling reason could be seen as wrong. But if the man's intent is genuine and the ex-wife deserves it, then he's not in the wrong. The line is thin here. \n\nConsidering the \"AITA\" context, often the community looks at intent and fairness. The man's intent is to show appreciation and help, which is positive. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The man might be in the right for his actions but in the wrong for not considering the impact on his current partner. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's giving a gift to someone who deserves it, even if it causes conflict. However, another angle is that he's causing harm to his current relationship, which could imply he's partly at fault for not handling it more sensitively. But the core action of giving money isn't inherently wrong. So, leaning towards B.\n"
