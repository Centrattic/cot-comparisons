I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person who wrote this is considering giving a large sum of money to their ex-wife after winning the lottery. The ex-wife is the mother of their two kids, and they divorced because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife has been supportive post-divorce, allowing the author to maintain a relationship with their children. The author feels a sense of gratitude and wants to give her the money as a way to show appreciation and help her out, especially since she can use it for her hobbies and to better their kids' lives. \n\nThe girlfriend is furious about this, thinking it's a sign the author is still in love with the ex. The author clarifies they're not in love but still love her as a parent. The author is considering going through with it despite the girlfriend's anger.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider a few angles. Legally, if the money is the author's to give, they can do so. The lawyer's approval suggests there's no legal issue. Emotionally, the girlfriend feels disrespected, which is valid. The author's ex is a co-parent, and supporting co-parents financially can be a touchy subject. Some might see it as a kind gesture, others as a potential conflict of interest, especially if it makes the current partner feel neglected or unappreciated. \n\nThe author's intention is to make amends and support the ex-wife, which is understandable given the past. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected in the relationship. The author should have discussed this with the girlfriend before making the decision. The fact that the girlfriend is threatening a breakup and the author is relieved adds another layer. The author might be prioritizing their past relationship over the current one, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut the author isn't giving the money for romantic reasons; it's about gratitude and their children's well-being. The ex-wife's financial situation is also a factor. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In a relationship, major financial decisions involving ex-partners can cause tension, especially if the current partner feels overlooked. The key issue is communication. The author didn't discuss it with the girlfriend, leading to her feeling blindsided. Even if the author's intentions are good, the lack of communication could be a mistake. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings, given the context. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the author's actions are causing significant distress to their current partner without prior discussion, it could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, the author's actions might be justified by their desire to support their ex-wife and children. \n\nI think the answer is nuanced, but given the girlfriend's strong reaction and the lack of communication, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their partner in this significant decision. However, the author's intentions are not malicious. The core issue is the failure to communicate, not necessarily the act itself. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong for not discussing it with their girlfriend first, even if the action isn't inherently wrong.\n"
