I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author winning a large sum of money and deciding to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which upsets his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is portrayed as being forgiving and a good co-parent. He wants to give her money to help her financially and as a gesture of goodwill. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accusing him of still loving his ex.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and he's trying to make amends for the past. He hasn't consulted her yet but has discussed it with his parents and lawyer. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author feels relieved by her threats. \n\nLegally, there's no issue if he's giving the money as a gift and not under any legal obligation. Ethically, it's about intentions. He's trying to do the right thing by his ex and kids. His girlfriend's jealousy might be a personal issue, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her feelings over his children's mother. \n\nHowever, the affair was his fault, so maybe he's trying to correct that. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid if they had an agreement about handling money, but the post doesn't mention that. The author hasn't broken any rules, and the ex is accepting the money as a gift. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a thoughtful decision to help his ex and kids, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's anger is personal and not a justification for the author being in the wrong.\n"
