I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is giving a large sum of money to their ex-wife despite their current girlfriend's anger. The main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife. The ex-wife is portrayed as a caring mother who allowed the author to stay in their kids' lives. The author feels they owe her this money as a way to make amends, given her financial situation and the previous betrayal.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected and believes the author still has feelings for the ex-wife. The author clarifies they're not in love with the ex but still love her as a parent and want to support the kids. \n\nNow, considering the context, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate towards their current partner. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the author is giving a significant financial gift to an ex without discussing it with their current partner. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of giving away such a large amount could be seen as a breach of trust in the relationship. The girlfriend has a right to feel that her partner is prioritizing another woman over their current relationship, especially given the history of infidelity. \n\nHowever, the ex-wife is the mother of their children, and the author's intention to support the kids is understandable. But the key point is communication. The author didn't consult their girlfriend before making this decision, which could be seen as a lack of respect for her feelings and the existing relationship. The girlfriend's threat to break up is a significant consequence the author is ignoring, which complicates the situation further.\n\nIn relationships, financial decisions involving ex-partners can be tricky, especially when there's a history of infidelity. The author's actions might be viewed as a mistake because they didn't consider their current partner's perspective and feelings. Even if the intention is noble, the execution lacks mutual respect and communication in the current relationship.\n"
