I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large sum of money after winning the lottery, which has upset their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is now a supportive co-parent, and he wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery winnings. The girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and that he's still in love with the ex. The author says he's not in love with his ex but wants to show he cares for the kids and her well-being.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about respect and communication. The author made a big financial decision without consulting his girlfriend. Even if his intentions are good\u2014to support his ex-wife and kids\u2014it's important to consider how such a gesture affects his current partner. The girlfriend feeling disrespected is a valid reaction because the sudden, large gift could be seen as prioritizing past relationships over the current one. Especially since the affair was his fault, it might come across as unfair or dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nHowever, the author's reasons are also understandable. He wants to provide for his children and support the mother who's been a good co-parent. But the way he's handling it might be careless. The girlfriend's reaction is a red flag that this action could harm their relationship. Even if the author's intentions are good, not discussing it with his partner first could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual respect are crucial. The fact that the author's parents and lawyer are on board doesn't negate the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's threat to break up is serious and suggests that this action is a deal-breaker for her. The author might be making a mistake by not considering the impact on their current relationship. While his motives are noble, the execution might be flawed, leading to the conclusion that he's in the wrong.\n"
