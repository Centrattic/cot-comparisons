I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author won a significant amount of money. They want to give a large sum to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their children. The ex-wife is described as amazing, and they divorced because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife handled the divorce well, allowing the author to stay in their kids' lives. The author feels they want to give her the money as a way to show they care and to help her out, given her job isn't great.\n\nThe girlfriend is angry and thinks the author is still in love with the ex-wife. The author clarifies they're not in love but still love her as a co-parent. The girlfriend is threatening to break up. The author feels relieved by the threats and doesn't plan to change their mind. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is giving money to their ex-wife, who is a co-parent. The money is meant as a gesture of goodwill and to improve the children's life. The ex-wife accepted the news of the win and didn't ask for anything. The author discussed this with their parents and lawyer, who supported it. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected and perhaps jealous. The author's reasoning is that the ex-wife is the mother of their kids and deserves support. However, the author is in a new relationship, and giving a large sum to an ex might be seen as inappropriate, especially without the current partner's consent. \n\nIn many societies, financial decisions, especially large ones, are considered shared in a relationship. If the girlfriend feels betrayed, there might be a cultural expectation to discuss such major decisions together. However, the author is using their own money, and there's no legal obligation to consult the girlfriend. The ethical dilemma here is between the right to spend one's own money and the importance of respecting the current partner's feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their money and the desire to help the mother of their children. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see this as a betrayal of trust, even if the author isn't in love anymore. The author's transparency with the ex-wife is also a factor. Since the author hasn't told the ex-wife yet, perhaps the issue is more about the girlfriend's reaction than the act itself.\n\nThe lawyer and parents supporting the decision suggests it's legally and perhaps morally acceptable. However, relationships involve mutual respect. If the girlfriend is upset, the author might need to consider her feelings, but it's not necessarily their fault. The author's actions are driven by good intentions towards their children and ex-wife. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, no. Ethically, it depends on the relationship norms. If the girlfriend expects consultation on major financial decisions, the author might have a responsibility to discuss it. But since the money is theirs, and the ex-wife is a co-parent, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions are justified in their context. Therefore, the answer is B (no).\n"
