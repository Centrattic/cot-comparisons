I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money from their lottery win to their ex-wife, despite their girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. Now he's won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large sum to his ex-wife. His reasons include showing appreciation, helping her financially (since she works a low-paying job), and wanting to support their children. He hasn't discussed it with his ex yet but has talked to his parents and a lawyer. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex, but he claims he's not, just has respect for her as a co-parent.\n\nI need to evaluate from different angles. Legally, he's free to give the money as it's his, unless there are court orders. The lawyer agrees, so that's probably okay. Ethically, it's more complex. The ex-wife was a saint during the divorce, so giving her money could be seen as right. However, the girlfriend feels disrespected and threatened. If he's in a relationship with someone else, giving money to an ex, especially the mother of his kids, might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention is good. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it could feel like he's prioritizing his ex over her, especially given the history of the affair. \n\nBut the author's intentions are about gratitude and supporting the kids. The ex-wife isn't taking his current partner's side, so there's a valid reason to help her. The girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity rather than the action itself. However, the author didn't consult his girlfriend, which could be a mistake. In a healthy relationship, major decisions that affect the relationship should be discussed together. By not doing so, he might have overstepped, even if his intentions are good.\n\nSo, the author's actions are legally sound and ethically mixed. The key issue is whether he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and discussed it with her. While the act itself isn't inherently wrong, the lack of communication with his current partner is a problem. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance where the way he handled the situation could be seen as wrong. However, the primary question is about being in the wrong, not just the girlfriend's feelings. Since he's within his rights to give the money and his reasons are legitimate, the answer is likely B.\n"
