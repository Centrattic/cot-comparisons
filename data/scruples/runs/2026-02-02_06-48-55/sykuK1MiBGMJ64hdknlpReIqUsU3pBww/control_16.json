I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum from his lottery win, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as a good person who handled the divorce amicably and is a good co-parent. The author still has feelings for her, not romantic, but respects her as a mother and wants to show he cares. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex, and the author is considering breaking up with her.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's intentions towards the ex-wife, the nature of his relationship with his current girlfriend, and the impact of his actions on both.\n\nThe author argues that he's not in love with the ex, but wants to help her and their kids. He also mentions that his parents and lawyer support him. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so this could improve her life. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected and is threatened by this action, which is causing their relationship to deteriorate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the ex-wife hasn't agreed to take the money yet, so he hasn't given it to her. But the intention is there. The key issues are: 1) whether giving money to an ex is inappropriate, especially when in a current relationship, and 2) if it's disrespectful to the current partner.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, the girlfriend feels that the author is showing more loyalty to his ex, which is a valid emotional concern. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the act of giving her a large sum might be perceived as a betrayal. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling undervalued, which is a common issue in relationships when a partner shows preferential treatment to an ex.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to support his children's mother and acknowledge his past mistakes. There's a public aspect here\u2014by posting on AITA, he's seeking validation. The ex-wife's reaction isn't mentioned, so it's unclear if she would accept the money. If she does, it's a personal choice, but the act of giving without her consent might be problematic.\n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, he can do so. But ethically, it's about the impact on current relationships. The author's actions are causing significant stress in his current relationship, which he seems to be okay with. But the girlfriend's well-being is a factor here. The author's lawyer is okay with it, but that's about legalities, not emotions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If the act of giving the money is causing harm to his current partner without her input, then yes. The girlfriend has a right to feel disrespected if she perceives this as favoritism. Even if the author's intentions are good, the effect on his relationship is negative. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his ex's needs over his current partner's feelings, which is a breach of respect. However, there's also an argument that helping a former spouse can be justified, but the context of the current relationship's reaction makes it a yes.\n"
