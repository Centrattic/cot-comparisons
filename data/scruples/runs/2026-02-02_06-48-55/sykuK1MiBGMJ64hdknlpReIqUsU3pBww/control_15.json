I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex-wife was gracious, allowing him to stay involved with the kids and kept things amicable. Now, after winning a significant amount of money, he wants to give her a portion to help her out, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex and that he's being disrespectful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex-wife was hurt by his affair but handled things with dignity. The author feels a sense of responsibility and gratitude towards her, especially as the kids' mother. The girlfriend feels disrespected, leading to potential breakup threats. The author is relieved about the threats, suggesting he might be conflicted.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, giving money to an ex-wife, especially after a divorce where there might be financial agreements, could be legally or ethically questionable. His ex-wife might have legal rights, but since he's consulting his lawyer who approved, maybe that's covered. The money is his to give, so from a legal standpoint, he's probably okay. \n\nEthically, the author's reasoning is based on gratitude and wanting to make up for past mistakes. He's not in love with her anymore but respects her. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, possibly due to insecurity or feeling that the ex-wife is being prioritized over their current relationship. \n\nThe author hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet, which might be a problem if she didn't expect or want the money. However, his intention is to do something good. The girlfriend's anger might be valid in that relationships require mutual respect and communication. By giving the money without discussing it with his girlfriend, he might have overlooked her feelings, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong if he believed it was the right thing to do.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's acting in good faith, considering his ex-wife's situation, and has legal support, then maybe he's not wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too, and maybe he should have discussed it with her first. But the author feels relieved by her threats, indicating he might not value her opinion as much here. That could suggest he's prioritizing his ex-wife's needs over his current partner's feelings, which could be seen as the wrong choice in the relationship context.\n\nSo, considering all angles: legally and ethically, the author might not be in the wrong. But in terms of relationship dynamics, he might be neglecting his girlfriend's feelings. The answer depends on whether the question focuses on moral/ethical/legal aspects or the relational aspect. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which could imply a mix of both. However, since his lawyer and parents support it, and the ex-wife was the first person he told, it seems he's acting with good intentions. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
