I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The context is that he won a significant amount of money, and he wants to give some to his ex-wife, who he still loves but isn't in love with. His ex-wife is a good co-parent, works a low-paying job, and he feels this is a way to show he cares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the author, his ex-wife, and his current girlfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. **Intentions of the Author**: He wants to give money to his ex-wife as a gesture of appreciation for her past kindness, to help her financially, and to show he's not a complete failure despite his past mistake (the affair). He's not in love with her anymore but still loves her as a mother.\n\n2. **Girlfriend's Reaction**: She's furious, accuses him of still being in love with the ex-wife and feels disrespected. He's considering not changing his plans, and the girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\n3. **Legal and Parental Support**: His parents and lawyer are on board with his decision, suggesting it's legally and ethically acceptable from their perspectives.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author's intentions seem genuine. He's trying to make amends for his past actions and support his children's mother. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter here. The act of giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife might be seen as neglecting the current partner's feelings, especially since the relationship is new (though the affair was the reason for the divorce). The girlfriend could perceive this as a betrayal of trust, especially if the author is still maintaining a close relationship with the ex-wife.\n\nBut the author isn't currently in a romantic relationship with the ex-wife, and the money is intended for the kids and her financial well-being. However, the girlfriend's emotional reaction is valid because she might feel that the author is prioritizing a past relationship over their current one. The fact that the ex-wife is close to the author's parents and respects him, but refuses to talk to the girlfriend, adds another layer. It might suggest that the ex-wife's actions could indirectly affect the girlfriend's relationship with the family.\n\nEthically, the author's decision to give money without discussing it thoroughly with his girlfriend could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the intentions are good, the communication and consideration of the girlfriend's perspective are important. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that the author is not fully committed to their relationship or that he's still emotionally entangled with his ex-wife.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions towards the ex-wife are framed as altruistic and for the benefit of the children. If the money is used to improve the ex-wife's life and their kids' upbringing, it's not inherently wrong. The legal support also indicates that there's no legal issue with the transfer.\n\nIn terms of relationship boundaries, giving a significant amount of money to an ex, especially after a divorce, can be sensitive. It's a matter of mutual respect and understanding between the author and his girlfriend. If the author had discussed this more carefully and considered her feelings, maybe the situation could have been handled better. But the author's stance is that he's not in love with the ex and that his actions are for the right reasons.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a nuanced situation. If the girlfriend feels that her partner is giving more emotional and financial support to an ex, it's natural for her to feel hurt. The author's lack of communication about this plan with his girlfriend is a problem. While his intentions may be good, the way he went about it without considering the girlfriend's feelings might be where he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's part of the current relationship, and such a significant decision should involve mutual discussion and agreement.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings when making a decision that affects their relationship, even if his intentions towards the ex-wife are positive.\n"
