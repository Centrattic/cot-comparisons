I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, which is causing conflict with his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is described as a good person, allowing him to see his kids and keeping the divorce amicable. The author feels a sense of guilt for his past actions and wants to make amends by giving her money. His parents and lawyer support this decision, but his girlfriend is angry and threatening to break up.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's trying to right a past wrong by helping his ex-wife, who works a low-paying job. He's also the father of their children, so supporting their mother could benefit the kids. His intentions seem genuine, driven by love for his children and gratitude for his ex's grace during the divorce.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend feels disrespected. She might perceive the gift as a sign that the author still has feelings for his ex or isn't fully committed to their relationship. The fact that the author hasn't discussed this with his ex yet could also be a point of contention, as it might come off as secretive. However, the author clarifies that he's not in love with his ex anymore, just loves her as a co-parent.\n\nLegally, since it's his own money, he can give it away as he sees fit unless there are specific restrictions from the divorce agreement. The lawyer's support suggests there's no legal issue. Ethically, it's a matter of personal relationships and boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, possibly feeling betrayed or unimportant. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if he didn't communicate his intentions more clearly with his girlfriend before making decisions that affect their relationship.\n\nBut the key points are the author's intentions to make amends and the support from his parents and lawyer. The ex-wife's willingness to accept the money without any strings attached also plays a role. The girlfriend's threat to break up over this could indicate deeper issues in their relationship, such as trust or insecurity. However, the author's decision is about his past and his children's well-being, which might not directly involve his current partner.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a personal choice to address his past mistakes, and as long as it's legal and consensual with the ex-wife, it's his money to give. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in the sense that she might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her feelings over his family responsibilities. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
