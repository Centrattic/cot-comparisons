I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author has a valid point: they made a mistake by having an affair, leading to the divorce. They still have kids with their ex-wife, who they describe as amazing and forgiving. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the author wants to help her out, which seems like a noble gesture. They also mention their parents and lawyer agree, which adds some legitimacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and maybe even jealous. She might see the ex-wife as a threat or feel neglected. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing their ex over their current partner. The question is whether the author is justified in their decision despite the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFactors to consider: The author's reasons are heartfelt, aiming to show appreciation for the ex's support and to help her financially. However, the girlfriend's emotional response is valid too. The author didn't consult her, which could be seen as a lack of respect for the current relationship. But since it's their money, they have the right to decide how to use it. However, relationships often require mutual respect and consideration. The author might have a point, but they should also consider how their actions affect their girlfriend. \n\nIn some cultures or relationship norms, giving money to an ex without the current partner's knowledge might be frowned upon, especially if it causes conflict. The author's intention is good, but the execution might have been flawed. They should have discussed it with their girlfriend first. Since the money is theirs, technically they can do what they want, but emotionally, it's a sensitive issue. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are respectful to both their ex and current partner. While the financial gesture is well-meant, the lack of communication with the girlfriend is a problem. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's their money and their decision, especially considering their ex's role as a parent. But they should have communicated better. The options are A or B. Given that the author isn't legally or morally bound to their girlfriend's approval, but their actions caused hurt, it's a bit of a gray area. The key point is whether the author's reasons are sufficient. Since they're trying to make amends and support their children's mother, and they've already considered legal advice, it's more about relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's reaction might be about insecurity, but the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
