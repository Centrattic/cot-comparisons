I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to his divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is described as having handled the divorce gracefully, allowing the author to maintain a relationship with their children, even though there's lingering pain. The author recently won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife, which is causing conflict with his current girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's intentions and the implications of his actions. He wants to express gratitude and provide financial support to his ex-wife, who he feels helped him through the difficult divorce. His ex-wife works a low-paying job, so this could improve her life. The author's parents and lawyer support this decision, which might indicate it's legally and socially acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and possibly believing the author still has feelings for his ex-wife. The author clarifies that he's not in love with his ex but still cares for her as a mother and co-parent. The girlfriend might feel that this gesture undermines their relationship, especially given the past affair.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is using his own money, which he's entitled to. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because sudden large financial decisions involving an ex can cause trust issues. Even if the author's intentions are good, the girlfriend might see it as a betrayal or a lack of respect for their current relationship. \n\nThe ex-wife's situation is also important. She's the mother of their children, and financial support for the kids' benefit could be seen as responsible. But since it's a large sum, there might be concerns about how the ex-wife would use it and whether there are any strings attached. \n\nLegal aspects are covered since the lawyer is on board, so there's no legal issue. The parents support the decision, which adds to the social aspect. However, the girlfriend's emotional response is a personal relationship issue. The author might be prioritizing his feelings towards his ex-wife over his current partner's feelings, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend beforehand, maybe they could have addressed her concerns. The fact that he didn't and is going through with it despite her anger might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though the money is his, how it affects the relationship matters. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be considered wrong in the context of his current relationship because he didn't communicate properly and his girlfriend feels disrespected. However, from a different angle, he's using his money to right past wrongs and support his children. It's a tricky balance. \n\nOverall, while the author's intentions may be good, the way he's handling the situation without considering his girlfriend's perspective might be where he's in the wrong. The key issue is the impact on his current relationship versus his past. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the relationship dynamics and lack of communication, even if the act itself isn't legally or ethically wrong.\n"
