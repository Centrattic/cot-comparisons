I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of their children, and they divorced six years ago because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. Now, the current girlfriend is angry and wants to break up because of this decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to reconcile with the ex-wife by giving her money, possibly to make amends for the past. The ex-wife is portrayed as having been gracious during the divorce and allowing the author to stay close to the kids. On the other hand, the current girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected, thinking the author might still be in love with the ex-wife, even though the author clarifies they're not in love but still have feelings of love and respect.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's intention to give money to the ex-wife as a gesture of goodwill and to support their kids, 2) The ex-wife's positive reaction when contacted, and 3) The girlfriend's reaction leading to potential breakup.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to make amends for past mistakes. However, there's the aspect of the current relationship. If the girlfriend feels disrespected, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings more. But since the author hasn't actually given the money yet and is seeking advice, maybe they're making a decision based on their own values. Also, the ex-wife is the mother of their children, so supporting her could be seen as responsible parenting.\n\nBut there's also the question of whether giving money to an ex could be problematic. The author's lawyer is on board, so maybe there's no legal issue. The girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity or feeling that the author is prioritizing the ex-wife over her. However, the author's intention is to support the kids and the ex-wife's financial situation, which is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to do what's right for their children and their ex-wife, who has been a good co-parent. The girlfriend's reaction is part of the conflict, but the author's actions are driven by past mistakes and a desire to correct them. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. Did the author consult their girlfriend before making this decision? They mentioned not discussing it with the ex yet, but their parents and lawyer are on board. If the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she wasn't included, that's a relationship issue. However, the core action of giving money to the ex-wife for the children's sake might not be wrong. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
