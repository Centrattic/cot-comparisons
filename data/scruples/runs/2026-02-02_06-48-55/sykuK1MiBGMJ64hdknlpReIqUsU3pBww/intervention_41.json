I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with her. The ex-wife is a good co-parent, and he feels a sense of guilt from his past affair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The author and his ex-wife are divorced, but he has kids with her. He wants to help her financially, which is understandable given her job and his guilt. But giving a large amount without her consent might be an issue. However, the ex-wife was happy for him and didn't push for anything. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is emotional, accusing him of still loving his ex. The author clarifies he doesn't, but the girlfriend sees it as a betrayal. The key here is whether the author is obligated to the girlfriend in terms of consulting her about financial decisions. Since it's his money, he's not wrong for wanting to give it away, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. However, the author's reasoning is about making amends and helping his ex-wife, not romantic feelings. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author can give the money as he sees fit. The girlfriend isn't a legal claimant. Emotionally, the author might be wrong in not considering his girlfriend's feelings before making such a big decision. But the core issue is whether the act of giving the money is wrong. The author isn't obligated to consult his girlfriend, so he's not in the wrong. His intentions are more about responsibility and guilt rather than romantic entanglement. The girlfriend's reaction is about insecurity, not a valid claim on his assets. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
