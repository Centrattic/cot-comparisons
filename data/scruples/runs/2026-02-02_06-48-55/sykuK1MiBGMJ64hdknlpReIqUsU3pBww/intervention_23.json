I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author is considering giving a large amount of money from their lottery win to their ex-wife, which is causing conflict with their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was unfaithful to their ex-wife, leading to a divorce six years ago. Now, they've won a significant amount of money and want to give a substantial portion to their ex-wife. The ex is described as a good co-parent, and the author feels a sense of obligation or guilt for their past actions. The current girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and threatened with a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's past infidelity, their current relationship, the financial gesture to the ex-wife, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel they're doing the right thing by helping the ex-wife and showing they're not a \"complete fuck up.\" However, giving a large sum of money to an ex, especially without consulting their current partner, can be seen as problematic. It could be considered a breach of trust in the current relationship, as the girlfriend might feel her partner is prioritizing someone from their past over their present relationship.\n\nLegal aspects: The author consulted their lawyer, which is good. If the money is their own (as in, it's a personal lottery win not tied to shared assets), then legally they have the right to give it away. But emotionally, in the context of their current relationship, it's a different matter.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger is understandable. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex anymore, the gesture could be perceived as still having emotional ties. The girlfriend might feel that the author is not respecting her by making such a significant financial commitment to someone else without her input.\n\nThe author mentions feeling relieved about the girlfriend's threats to break up, which adds another layer. That could indicate underlying issues in the relationship that the author isn't fully addressing. Maybe the relationship has issues that this situation is just bringing to light.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong. But ethically or in terms of relationship dynamics, they might be. It's about the impact on the current relationship versus their sense of duty to the ex. The author's intention is to help the ex-wife and the kids, which is commendable, but the method might be flawed because it's causing harm to the current partner.\n\nSo, considering both the legal and emotional aspects, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are respectful to their current partner. Since they didn't consult the girlfriend and the gesture is causing significant distress, it could be seen as wrong in the context of their current relationship, even if it's well-intentioned towards the ex.\n"
