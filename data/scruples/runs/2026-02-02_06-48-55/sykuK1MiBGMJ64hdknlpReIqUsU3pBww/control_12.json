I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend being angry about it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. He won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large sum to his ex-wife, who's a good co-parent. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with his ex, even though he says he's not. The ex works a low-paying job, and the author feels this money would help her and their kids. His parents and lawyer support it, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. Legally, if the money is his to give, then he can probably do that. But there's an emotional aspect here. His girlfriend feels disrespected, maybe because he's giving money to an ex, even if it's for valid reasons. The ex is the mother of his children, so supporting them could be seen as responsible. But the girlfriend might feel he's prioritizing his ex over her, especially since the affair was his mistake originally.\n\nMoral perspective: The author wants to make amends for his past actions by helping his ex-wife and kids. That's noble. However, he didn't consult his girlfriend, leading to her feeling ignored. Communication is key in relationships, so maybe the problem isn't the act itself but the lack of discussion. If he had talked to his girlfriend first, maybe she would have understood. But he didn't, so is he at fault?\n\nSocial norms: People might look at this as him trying to do the right thing by his kids and ex, but also as being unfair to the current partner. Relationships often require both parties to feel valued. If the girlfriend feels undermined, that's a valid concern.\n\nAnother point: The ex-wife is a saint-like figure here, which adds to the author's justification. But the girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or feeling that he's not committed to the current relationship. The author mentions feeling relieved by the breakup threats, which might indicate he's not fully committed either.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are good, but the lack of communication with his girlfriend is a problem. However, since the money is his and he's supporting his children, maybe he's justified. But from a relationship standpoint, he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer could be either A or B depending on the perspective. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering both the legal right to give the money and the relational harm caused, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's acting in the best interest of his children and ex, even if communication was lacking. But maybe A if the focus is on the girlfriend's feelings. Hmm.\n"
