I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. Now, the girlfriend is angry because he's giving the money to his ex, which makes her feel disrespected. The author feels he's trying to make amends and help his kids by providing financial support, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is giving money to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is a good co-parent, and the author has a strained relationship with his current girlfriend. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for giving the money to his ex.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to do something good for his ex-wife and their kids. He's showing responsibility towards his children and acknowledging his past mistake by helping his ex. The lawyer and parents support him, which might indicate that there's some legal or familial consideration. Also, the ex-wife was understanding during the divorce and the affair, so the author might feel a sense of obligation to her.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected. If the author is in a current relationship, giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife, even for good reasons, might be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend might feel that he's not prioritizing her or the current relationship, especially if the financial commitment is significant. Also, the author mentions that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend, which could be a red flag that the current partner isn't fully accepted in the family dynamic, which might add to the tension.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own feelings. He says he's still in love with his ex-wife in a way, but not romantically. However, the girlfriend might not see the difference, especially if the author is still financially and emotionally connected to his ex. The act of giving a large amount of money could be perceived as maintaining a close relationship with the ex, which the girlfriend might find unacceptable.\n\nAlso, from a relationship standpoint, major financial decisions that affect a partner should be discussed with them. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about this, which might be a key point. Even if the money is his own, the girlfriend has a right to feel involved in such significant decisions, especially since they are in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling that her needs and feelings are being overlooked.\n\nBut then again, the author's intentions are to help his kids and ex-wife. If the money is meant for the children's benefit, that's a different matter. However, the way the author presents it, it's both for the ex-wife's benefit (since she works a low-paying job) and the kids. The girlfriend might feel that the author is favoring his ex over her, especially if the money could also be used for their future together.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has valid reasons from a family and moral perspective, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. The key here is whether the author's actions are respectful to both his ex-wife and his current partner. Since he's giving the money to an ex without consulting his current partner, it could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the amount is large enough to impact his ability to support the current relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger might be justified if she feels that the author is not being transparent or is prioritizing his past relationship over their current one. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the act of giving a large sum of money could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for the current partner's position.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about such a significant decision. While his intentions are good, the way he's handling it could be hurting the current relationship. The girlfriend has a right to feel that her input is necessary in major financial decisions that involve the author's life, especially when it affects their relationship dynamics.\n"
