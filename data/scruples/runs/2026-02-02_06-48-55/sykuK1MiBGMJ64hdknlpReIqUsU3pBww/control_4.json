I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery, which has caused tension with the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points in the scenario. The person is giving money to their ex-wife who is the mother of their children. They had a messy divorce due to an affair with the current partner. The ex-wife has been cooperative in co-parenting and has shown forgiveness. The money is intended as a gesture of goodwill, to help her financially, and to show care despite past mistakes. The lawyer and parents support the decision, but the girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and possibly seeing this as a sign the person still loves the ex.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, since the lawyer is on board, there's probably no legal issue. But ethically and relationally, it's more complex. The author's motivation seems genuine: to support the ex-wife and the kids. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because giving a significant amount of money to an ex can be seen as a betrayal, especially if it wasn't discussed. The girlfriend might feel that the author is still emotionally tied to the ex, which could strain their current relationship.\n\nThe author didn't consult the girlfriend, which is a problem. Relationships often require communication and mutual respect. Even if the author's intentions are good, not considering the girlfriend's feelings in this decision could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, the author's desire to support their children's mother isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it's handled might be. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected are legitimate, and the author's relief at the breakup threats suggests underlying issues that might need addressing.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author is in a complicated situation. While their intentions are good, the action of giving the money without considering the current partner's feelings could be seen as wrong. The answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate with their girlfriend, which is a key part of any relationship. But some might argue it's not the author's fault if they prioritized their children's well-being. However, the girlfriend's perspective is important here, and the author's decision to proceed despite her reaction could be seen as dismissive.\n"
