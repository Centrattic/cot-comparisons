I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person (author) won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, who's the mother of his kids. The ex-wife is portrayed as having been gracious during the divorce, even though he cheated. He hasn't told the ex-wife yet but has discussed it with his parents and lawyer.\n\nHis current girlfriend is furious, accusing him of still loving his ex and disrespecting her. The author says he doesn't love his ex anymore but still cares about her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the ex-wife situation. He wants to help her financially because she works a low-paying job and he feels guilty for the affair. He's trying to show appreciation for her being a good co-parent. Is it wrong to give her money? It might depend on their agreement during the divorce. If there's no legal obligation, and he's using his own money, maybe not. But if they had a settlement, giving her a large sum could be an issue. However, the author mentioned talking to a lawyer, so maybe that's sorted.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's reaction. She's upset because he's giving money to his ex. If he's giving away a significant portion of his winnings without discussing it with her, that could be a problem in their relationship. Even if he has the right to give the money, not considering her feelings could be a relationship mistake. The girlfriend might see this as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for their future together.\n\nThe author mentions feeling relieved about the break-up threats, which suggests he might be using this as a way to justify leaving the relationship. That could be seen as selfish. However, his intentions with the money seem genuine\u2014helping his ex-wife and kids.\n\nSo, is he wrong? If the money is his to give, and he's acting on good intentions, he might not be in the wrong. But if the action is hurting his current partner and he's not considering her feelings, that's a problem. The answer hinges on whether the act of giving the money to his ex is his right and if it's affecting their relationship negatively. The situation is complex, but since he hasn't done anything illegal and is trying to do the right thing by his ex and kids, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, his disregard for his girlfriend's feelings could be an issue. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
