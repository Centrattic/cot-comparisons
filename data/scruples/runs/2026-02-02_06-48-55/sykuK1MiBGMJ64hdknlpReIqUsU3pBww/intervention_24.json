I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of his two kids. They divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend (gf). The ex is described as kind, allowing him to see the kids and keeping the divorce as painless as possible. The author feels he needs to give her the money to show he's not a complete jerk, despite his past mistakes. His parents and lawyer support him. However, when he told his current girlfriend, she got very angry, thinking he's still in love with the ex and that this is disrespectful. The author says he's relieved by her threats to break up but still plans to give the money.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions seem genuine. He wants to acknowledge the ex-wife's sacrifices, help her improve her life, and support their children. The ex-wife worked a low-paying job, so the money could help her pursue hobbies and provide better for the kids. The author's parents and lawyer support him, suggesting that there's no legal issue, and the ex-wife didn't show any objections when he told her.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex-wife, giving her a large sum could be seen as undermining their current relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because she's his partner now, and big financial decisions, especially involving a past spouse, can be hurtful. The author didn't consult with his girlfriend before making this decision, which could be a breach of trust or respect.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication in the current relationship. The author made a significant decision that affects his current relationship without discussing it with his girlfriend. Even if his intentions are good towards the ex-wife, the action could be perceived as a betrayal or lack of respect towards his current girlfriend. The girlfriend's anger is a legitimate reaction to being excluded from such a major decision.\n\nBut then again, the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and supporting them is in the kids' best interest. However, the issue isn't just about the kids; it's about the author's relationship with his current partner. The author might not have considered how this would affect his girlfriend's feelings, which is a valid point. In relationships, discussing major financial decisions is important to maintain trust and mutual respect.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not considering the impact on his current relationship, even if his intentions towards the ex-wife are good. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not being transparent and respecting his girlfriend's feelings first. However, the ex-wife's situation is also valid, but the author's approach might have been too abrupt without considering his current partner's perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are noble, the way he handled the situation\u2014without discussing it with his girlfriend first\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate towards her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong in this scenario.\n"
