I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author cheated on his ex-wife with his current girlfriend, which led to their divorce six years ago. Now, he's won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. The main conflict is with his girlfriend, who's upset and threatening to break up.\n\nThe author's reasons for giving the money are mixed. He mentions that he still loves his ex-wife, she's a good co-parent, and she works a low-paying job. He wants to show her he cares despite his past mistakes. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with the ex.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give, he can probably do so. But ethically and emotionally, it's tricky. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she's his current partner, and she might feel betrayed or neglected. The fact that he had an affair in the past complicates things further. Even if he's not in love with the ex anymore, giving her a large sum could be seen as prioritizing his past relationship over his current one.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife was a good co-parent, and he wants to provide for the kids. But there's no mention of consulting the ex-wife about the money or ensuring it's needed. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which is a significant issue in any relationship.\n\nThe author's parents and lawyer being on board doesn't necessarily mean it's the right choice for the relationship. The key here is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. He didn't discuss it with his girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a mistake.\n\nSo, while the author has his reasons, the main issue is not respecting his current partner's feelings. Relationships require communication and consideration. By giving the money without discussing it with his girlfriend, he might be seen as neglecting her perspective, which could lead to valid feelings of betrayal even if there's no romantic attachment anymore.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his current partner's feelings and acted on a personal decision that caused her significant distress without considering their relationship dynamics.\n"
