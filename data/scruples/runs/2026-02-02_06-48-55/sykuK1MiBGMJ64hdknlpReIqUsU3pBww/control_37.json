I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, which is causing conflict with his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. He mentioned involving his lawyer, who was on board. So legally, there might not be an issue. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and he's providing for them, which is part of his responsibility. But he's giving money to her specifically, not just for the kids. That could be a point of contention.\n\nEmotionally, he's still connected to his ex-wife because of their children. He wants to show her he cares and make up for past mistakes. His feelings are valid, but does that justify giving her a large sum? It depends on the relationship with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected. Even if he's not in love anymore, giving a large amount to an ex can be seen as a betrayal, especially if it's not discussed and agreed upon in the current relationship.\n\nThe fact that he didn't consult his girlfriend before making the decision is a problem. In any relationship, major financial decisions that affect the partner should be discussed. His girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing that he's prioritizing his ex over her. Even if his intentions are good, the action could be seen as crossing a line in their relationship. \n\nAlso, the ex-wife works a low-paying job and he wants to help her, but is it his place to give her money? He's responsible for the kids, but giving her money beyond that might be a personal choice that doesn't need to be at the expense of his current partner's feelings. The girlfriend might feel that he's not considering their future together, which is a valid concern in a new relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong from the perspective of his girlfriend. He's making a significant financial commitment without discussing it with her, which can be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the trust in the relationship. Even if his intentions are good, the action is causing harm to his current relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other angle I'm missing. The legal aspect is covered, but the emotional and relational aspects are more about personal boundaries and respect in the new relationship. So yes, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
