I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his current girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce with his ex-wife. Now, after winning a large amount, he wants to give money to his ex-wife to help her and their kids. The girlfriend is upset and threatening to break up, feeling disrespected.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention to give money to his ex-wife, the history of the affair that caused the divorce, and the current relationship dynamics with his girlfriend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this decision.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that he's righting past wrongs by supporting his ex-wife and children. He acknowledges his mistake with the affair and wants to show care for his kids' mother. His parents and lawyer support him, which adds weight to his side. Also, the ex-wife is a positive figure, working a low-paying job, and the money could improve her life.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She might feel neglected or disrespected because the author is giving significant money to his ex-wife. The affair was a major betrayal, and this action could reopen old wounds or make her feel undervalued. The author's decision without discussing it with her first could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's intention is to support his children and ex-wife, which is commendable. However, the way he's handling it might overlook the girlfriend's emotions. He should have communicated better, perhaps involving her in the discussion to address her concerns. Even if he decides to proceed, transparency and mutual understanding are important in a relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If he respects his girlfriend's feelings and communicates, maybe not entirely. But by not considering her perspective and acting unilaterally, he might be at fault. The girlfriend's reaction is a red flag he should not ignore. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, so moving forward without her input could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't adequately address his girlfriend's feelings before making the decision, even if his intentions are good. But there's also a case for B if the action is seen as a personal choice for his children and ex-wife's well-being. However, the main issue lies in the communication and respect for his current partner's feelings.\n"
