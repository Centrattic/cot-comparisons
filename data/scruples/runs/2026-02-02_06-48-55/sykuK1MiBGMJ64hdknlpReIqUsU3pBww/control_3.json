I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to their ex-wife despite their girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the author is giving money to the ex-wife, who is the mother of their children. The ex-wife allowed a painless divorce after the author's affair with the current girlfriend. The money is intended as a way to show appreciation and provide financial stability, especially since the ex-wife works a low-paying job. The author's parents and lawyer support this, but the girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of the author still loving the ex-wife. The author clarifies they aren't in love with the ex anymore, just respect her.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the ex-wife's role as the kids' mother and her past forgiveness are important factors. The author's intention is to make amends and help, which could be seen as responsible and generous. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she feels her partner is prioritizing the ex-wife over their current relationship. But since the author isn't in love with the ex, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. The author hasn't discussed it with the ex yet, but the planning with parents and lawyer suggests they've thought it through. \n\nBut there's a potential conflict of interest. The girlfriend's resentment might lead to a breakup, which the author is relieved about. Is the author wrong for not considering their girlfriend's feelings? The act itself\u2014helping the ex-wife\u2014could be justified as a parental responsibility, but maybe the author should have communicated better with the girlfriend first. However, the author's reasons are genuine and aimed at supporting the kids and the ex-wife. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly projecting her insecurities. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action isn't inherently unethical. The ex-wife is part of their children's lives, and providing financial support could be seen as a responsible decision. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't obligated to consult her on every financial decision. However, the author might need to address the communication gap with their girlfriend to resolve the tension. So, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the actions are motivated by genuine reasons and supported by their parents and lawyer, despite the girlfriend's anger.\n"
