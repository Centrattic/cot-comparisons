I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife after winning the lottery, despite his current girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a large sum to his ex-wife, the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he cheated on his ex with his current girlfriend. The ex is portrayed as a good person who handled the divorce well, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives. Now, after the win, he wants to give her money as a way to show he cares and to help her and the kids. His girlfriend is furious, thinks he's disrespecting her and that he's still in love with the ex. The author is considering if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the question is whether giving this money is wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, after a divorce, unless there are specific alimony or child support arrangements, he might not be obligated to give her money. The lawyer he consulted is on board, so maybe there's no legal issue. Ethically, it's more complicated. He's in a relationship now, and giving away a large sum without discussing it with his current partner could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships typically involve mutual decisions about major financial matters. His girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling disrespected or that her current relationship isn't valued as much as his past one.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to make amends for his past mistake (the affair) and to support his children's mother, who's been a good co-parent. The ex is in a low-paying job, so this could improve her life. The man still loves her as a parent, not romantically. However, the girlfriend might feel that this gesture implies lingering romantic feelings, even if he says he's not in love with her anymore. The fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds tension here. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the man's responsibility to his current partner. Major financial decisions can affect both partners' lives, even if it's given to someone else. Not discussing it with her could be seen as selfish or disrespectful. However, if there's no legal or prior obligation, it's his money to do with as he pleases. The girlfriend's threat to break up might be a sign that their relationship has issues with trust or communication, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the man's actions are unethical given the context. If he's fulfilling his parental responsibilities and making amends, it could be justified. However, the lack of communication with his current partner is a problem. But since the money is his, and the ex is the mother of his children, it's a gray area. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the man's not considering her feelings in his decision. \n\nI think the key here is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Ethically, it's debatable. The main issue is the communication with his girlfriend. If he had discussed it with her first, maybe they could have found a compromise. But by not doing so, he's making a unilateral decision that affects their relationship. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he's ignoring his current partner's feelings and not considering the impact on their relationship. But some might say B (not in the wrong) because it's his money and he's helping his ex and kids. However, the ethical responsibility in a relationship includes transparency. So, I'm leaning towards A.\n"
