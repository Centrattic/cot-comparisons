I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a portion to his ex-wife, who he admires as a mother and for her grace during the divorce. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and he wants to help her out. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex, but he clarifies he's not in love anymore, just has respect.\n\nHmm, so first, is there any legal issue here? He mentioned consulting his lawyer, who was on board, so probably the distribution of funds isn't violating any legal agreements. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and he wants to support them both. That seems reasonable, but does his intention matter? He's giving it out of respect and to correct past wrongs, not because he's still in love. But the girlfriend feels disrespected. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, giving a large sum to an ex might feel like betrayal, even if there's no romantic intent. Relationships often have unspoken boundaries, and this might cross one. The author might not realize the emotional impact of his actions on his current partner. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife is a significant figure in his kids' lives, and supporting her could benefit the children. The author is trying to make amends for his past mistake (the affair). But is it his responsibility to support her financially beyond child support? That's a gray area. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, no. Emotionally, maybe he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings enough. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because sudden large financial gestures to an ex can cause tension. The author should have communicated better with his girlfriend beforehand. However, his intentions are good, but the execution might be hasty. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He's not legally wrong, but emotionally and relationally, he might have made a mistake by not addressing his girlfriend's feelings first. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he's causing distress to his partner, even if his intentions are good. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if we prioritize his reasons and the lawyer's approval. But given the context, the relational harm might tip it towards A. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
