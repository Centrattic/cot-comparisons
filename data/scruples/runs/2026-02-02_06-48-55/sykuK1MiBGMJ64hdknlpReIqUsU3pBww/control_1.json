I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money he won. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. He feels guilty and wants to show his ex he cares by giving her money. The ex is described as a good mother and handled the divorce gracefully despite his betrayal. She works a low-paying job, so the money would help her.\n\nHis girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves the ex. The author says he doesn't love the ex anymore but still loves her as a parent and wants to help. He's considering going through with it despite the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is it wrong to give money to an ex to make up for past wrongs when in a new relationship? Legally, the lawyer approved, so maybe that's okay. Emotionally, the girlfriend feels disrespected. The ex is a good mother, and the author wants to support the kids. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author did wrong by having an affair, but now he's trying to make amends. However, giving a large sum without the girlfriend's input could be seen as irresponsible. Some might think it's selfish to make such a decision without considering the current partner's feelings. Others might see it as a sincere effort to right past wrongs.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is obligated to the ex-wife beyond the financial aspect. Since the divorce was six years ago, and there's no legal obligation, the decision is more about ethics. The author's intentions are good, but the execution might be poor, especially if it's causing major conflict in the current relationship. However, since the ex is a good co-parent, helping her could benefit the kids. \n\nSo, there's a balance between personal ethics and the impact on the current relationship. The author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to do something positive, but he also didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective. However, it's his money, and he has a right to decide how to use it. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected rather than a legal or moral issue. \n\nOverall, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's acting on his own conscience and trying to make amends, even if it's causing tension. But some might argue that he should have discussed it more with his girlfriend. Since the user is asking for AITA, the answer leans towards B.\n"
