I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to their ex-wife. Their girlfriend is furious and threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, the ex-wife is the mother of their kids and was a saint during the divorce. The author feels guilty for the affair and wants to make amends. The ex works a low-paying job, so this money could help her. The author's parents and lawyer support this decision. But the girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author still loves the ex.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they did cheat on their ex-wife with their current girlfriend, which was their mistake. Now, giving money to the ex might be seen as favoring her over the current partner. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here. The author might not be in love with the ex anymore, but giving a large sum could be perceived as a betrayal, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand. Relationships often require mutual respect and consideration for each other's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction shows she feels disrespected. The author's relief at the breakup threat is a red flag too. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to make amends and help their ex-wife, who's been good with co-parenting. The ex might need the help. But the action of giving a large sum without the current partner's input could be impulsive. It's about balancing past obligations with current relationships. The author might be prioritizing past ties over present ones, which can cause conflict. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their girlfriend's feelings and made a significant decision that could be seen as unfair to her. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected in the relationship. The author's actions could undermine the trust and equality in their current relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
