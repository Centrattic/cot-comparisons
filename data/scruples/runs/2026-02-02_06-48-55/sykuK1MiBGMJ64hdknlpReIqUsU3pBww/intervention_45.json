I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex. The author says he's not in love, just wants to show appreciation for her parenting and help the kids. The ex worked at a low-paying job, so giving her money could improve her life.\n\nFirst, is it wrong to give money to the ex-wife? Well, the ex is the mother of their kids. He might feel a responsibility to support them both. But he's now in a new relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014angry, accusing him of still loving the ex. The author hasn't discussed it with the ex yet, but the lawyer and parents think it's okay. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend is part of his current life. Did he consider her feelings? Maybe he should have discussed this with her first, even if he wasn't in love with the ex anymore. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or that he's prioritizing the past. However, the author's intentions are good\u2014helping the ex and kids. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex agreed to keep things amicable after the affair. The author is trying to make amends. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because unexpected large gifts can cause jealousy or insecurity. The author didn't consult her, which might be a breach of trust. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intention is noble, but the way he handled it (without consulting his girlfriend) might have been inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective and made a big decision without discussing it with her. Even if his intentions are good, the method could be flawed.\n"
