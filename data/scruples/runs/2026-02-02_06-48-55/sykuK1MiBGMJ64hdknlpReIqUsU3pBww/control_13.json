I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife after winning the lottery, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the context: The man had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. His ex is described as a saint, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives and being respectful. He wants to give her money as a way to show he's not a complete failure and to help her financially. His girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves the ex. The man says he doesn't love the ex anymore but still loves her as a parent.\n\nSo, considering the facts, the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and he's providing for them. He's not in a relationship with her anymore, but he's trying to make amends for past mistakes. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected. But the man's intentions are to support his ex-wife and children, which is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also important. But since the money is for his ex-wife and kids, it's his money to give, right? Unless there's a legal issue, but the lawyer was on board, so that's probably covered.\n\nThe key points here are: legal clearance from the lawyer, his ex-wife is happy with the gesture, and he's acting in the best interest of his children. His girlfriend's threat to break up is a personal issue, but the man's actions are about family and past commitments. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling insecure or not respected, but the man isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to provide for his ex-wife and kids. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because his actions are reasonable and justified given the circumstances.\n"
