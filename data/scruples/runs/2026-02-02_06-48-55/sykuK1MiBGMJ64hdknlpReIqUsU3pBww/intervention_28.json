I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to their ex-wife after winning the lottery, despite their girlfriend being angry about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex-wife was a saint, allowed him to see the kids, and stayed respectful. The author won a large sum and wants to give a significant amount to the ex-wife as a way to show appreciation and help her. However, the girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with the ex-wife. The author says he's not in love anymore but still loves her for the kids.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and he's trying to make amends for his past mistakes. He hasn't discussed it with her yet, but his parents and lawyer agree it's a good idea. On the other hand, his girlfriend feels betrayed and disrespected. The author's actions might be seen as a way to reconcile with his past, but it's causing tension in his current relationship.\n\nI need to think about the relationship dynamics. The author ended the previous marriage through an affair, which is a major betrayal. Now, giving money to the ex-wife might be perceived as another betrayal to the current partner. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's a significant gesture that could imply ongoing emotional ties. Even if the author isn't in love anymore, the act of giving a large sum of money could be seen as prioritizing the past over the present partner.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the money would help her. But the author has a responsibility to his current partner as well. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are being neglected. The author's decision to go ahead without discussing it more with his girlfriend could be a misstep. Communication is key in such situations, and maybe the author didn't consider how it would affect his current relationship.\n\nAlso, the mention that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds another layer. The author is trying to maintain a relationship with his children, which is important, but his actions might be complicating the current relationship. The girlfriend's anger could be justified if she feels she's being sidelined in favor of the ex-wife.\n\nHowever, the author's intentions are good\u2014he wants to help his ex-wife and the kids. But the way he's handling it might be problematic. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and not addressing them properly could lead to the breakup. The author's relief at the threats might indicate that he's not fully aware of the emotional impact on his girlfriend.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions, while well-intentioned, may be inconsiderate of his current partner's feelings. He made a significant decision that affects both his ex-wife and his girlfriend without adequately addressing the concerns of his current partner. So, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ex-wife's needs over his girlfriend's feelings without proper communication and consideration.\n"
