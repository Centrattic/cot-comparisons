I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that he won a large sum of money, maybe millions, and he wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset about it and might break up with him. The question is whether he's doing the right thing.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. He admits he did wrong by his ex-wife. Now, he wants to give her money, not out of obligation but to show he cares and to help her. He hasn't discussed it with her yet but talked to his parents and lawyer, who support it. His girlfriend is angry, thinking he still loves his ex-wife, though he says he's not in love with her anymore, just respects her as a mother and co-parent.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is he in the wrong? Well, he's choosing to help someone from his past, who has been a good co-parent and has shown forgiveness. He's not giving the money for selfish reasons but to make amends and help her out. On the other hand, his current girlfriend feels disrespected and maybe betrayed. Relationships require communication and mutual understanding. But he hasn't given the money yet, so maybe he should have discussed it with his girlfriend first. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether he should have communicated better.\n\nLegally, unless there's a court order or some restriction on the lottery money, he can give it to whomever he wants. Emotionally, his ex-wife might appreciate it, given her history with him. His girlfriend's reaction is valid because being left out of such a big decision could hurt. But if he's not in love with his ex-wife and is just doing this out of respect and a desire to help, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe key points are: his intentions are good, he's helping someone who's been important in his life, and there's no legal issue. The conflict is with his current partner, but that's more about their relationship dynamics than his right to give the money. So, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
