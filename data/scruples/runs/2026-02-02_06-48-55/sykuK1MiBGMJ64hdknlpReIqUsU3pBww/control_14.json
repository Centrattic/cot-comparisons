I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who gave their ex a large amount of money from their lottery winnings is in the wrong, especially considering their girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the guy had an affair, which led to a divorce. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping the divorce amicable. Now, he wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery money. His reasons include showing appreciation for her past support, helping her financially since she works a low-paying job, and ensuring the kids have a better life.\n\nThe girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with the ex. He says he's not in love, just loves her as the mother of their kids. The girlfriend is threatening to break up, and he's relieved but doesn't plan to change his decision.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, financially supporting an ex, especially for co-parenting, isn't inherently wrong. The ex is a co-parent, and providing for the kids' benefit is a valid reason. Also, she's in a better position now to support the kids. However, giving a significant sum without informing the girlfriend might strain the current relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because sudden financial decisions involving an ex can make a partner feel disrespected or undervalued.\n\nBut the key points here are that the ex was receptive, and the money is for the kids and her well-being. The author is being transparent with his parents and lawyer, which shows he's considering legal and familial aspects. The girlfriend's anger seems more about feeling slighted than any legal or ethical issue. The author isn't obligated to share money with his ex, but his intentions seem genuine.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of commitment. Giving a large sum to an ex might imply ongoing financial ties or emotional attachment that the girlfriend isn't comfortable with. The author claims he's not in love, but the girlfriend's reaction is about the gesture itself. The question is whether this gesture is appropriate given their current relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are positive, the action of giving a large sum to an ex without the girlfriend's consent might be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings, even if it's for the right reasons. So, there's a case for him being in the wrong, but it's not a clear-cut issue. The answer hinges on the balance between his good intentions and the impact on his current relationship.\n"
