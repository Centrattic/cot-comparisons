I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving a large amount of money to an ex-wife after a lottery win, which has caused conflict with the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex is a good co-parent and has been supportive despite the betrayal. The author wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery winnings to show appreciation and help her financially. However, the girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of the author still being in love with his ex.\n\nKey points to consider: The author's intentions are to acknowledge his ex's past support and to help her financially. The ex works a low-paying job, so this could improve her life. The author is consulting with his parents and a lawyer, which suggests he's considering legal and family perspectives. However, the girlfriend is his current partner, and giving away a large sum to an ex without her knowledge or consent could be seen as a breach of trust in their relationship. Even if he's not romantically involved with the ex anymore, the fact that the girlfriend is his current partner and the money is a shared resource (if it's a joint account or if they have certain financial commitments) could be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is prioritizing his ex over her, especially if they have ongoing financial dependencies or if the author's actions are perceived as a lack of commitment to their relationship. The author mentions that he's \"feeling relieved\" by the breakup threats, which might indicate underlying issues in the relationship that need to be addressed, but that's a separate issue from whether giving the money is the wrong move.\n\nLegally, if the money is considered separate property (since it's a lottery win, which is typically individual, unless the state has community property laws), the author might have the right to give it away. However, in a relationship, financial decisions can have emotional implications beyond legal rights. The author's ex is the mother of his children and a co-parent, which adds another layer of responsibility. On the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings and the trust in the relationship are important too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. From a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give, he might not be. But from a relational and ethical standpoint, giving a large sum to an ex without discussing it with the current partner could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's anger is a valid reaction, even if the author's intentions are good. The key here is whether the author considered the girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship before making the decision. Since he didn't discuss it with her and she's now threatening to break up, it's possible that he overlooked the emotional aspect of their relationship, even if the action was intended to be kind to the ex. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from a relational and ethical perspective, even if legally it's permissible. \n\nBut wait, the author's intention is to do the right thing by his ex, who has been a good co-parent. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected, which is a valid concern in a relationship. The author might be prioritizing past obligations over current relationship boundaries. The fact that he's relieved by the breakup threats suggests that maybe the relationship had existing issues, but that doesn't justify the action. The core issue is whether it's appropriate to give a large sum to an ex without consulting the current partner, especially when it's a significant financial decision. In many relationships, sharing major financial decisions is expected as a sign of trust and respect. By not involving his girlfriend, the author might have acted unilaterally, which could be seen as the wrong move regardless of his intentions.\n"
