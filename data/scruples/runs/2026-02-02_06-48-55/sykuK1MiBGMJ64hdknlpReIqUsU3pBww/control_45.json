I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery, despite the current girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man had an affair with his current partner, which led to the divorce. His ex-wife was understanding and allowed him to stay in his kids' lives. Now he wants to give her a significant amount of money, which his ex might use to improve her life. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her and still being in love with the ex.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. Legally, he might not have an obligation to give her money unless there's a prenup or court order, but he's consulting a lawyer who's on board, so maybe that's settled. Emotionally, he feels he needs to do this as a gesture of goodwill towards the ex and for the kids. However, his current partner feels disrespected, which is a relationship issue.\n\nHe says he's not in love with the ex anymore, just loves the kids and respects her. The ex is using the money to help the kids' lives, which he sees as a positive. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, even considering breaking up. The author is relieved about the breakup threats, which might indicate some underlying issues in their relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, showing generosity to an ex, especially a co-parent, can be seen as right if it benefits the children and honors past relationships. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. Did he consider discussing this with her before making the decision? If he didn't involve her in the decision-making process, that could be a point against him. But if he had a legitimate reason related to the kids and the ex's circumstances, it's more about balancing two important relationships.\n\nThe ex worked a low-paying job, so the money could genuinely help her. His parents and lawyer support it, which adds weight to the idea that it's a reasonable gesture. However, the girlfriend feeling disrespected is a valid concern. Maybe he should have communicated better. But ultimately, his actions don't seem malicious. He's trying to make amends in a respectful way. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's acting in good faith, not out of lingering love but to support the kids and ex-wife, and the legal aspects are okay, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's feelings were neglected without a good reason, that could be an issue. But since the main motive is positive and the legal side is covered, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
