I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money after winning the lottery, despite their girlfriend being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife. The ex-wife has been a saint, allowing the father to see the kids and keeping things civil. The person wants to give her a significant sum to show appreciation and help her out, especially since she works in a low-paying job. Their parents and lawyer support this, but the girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and a sign of lingering feelings.\n\nNow, the key points are about the ethics of giving money to an ex-wife after a divorce caused by infidelity. The user's ex-wife is being generous and still cares about the kids. The person wants to give her money as a gesture of goodwill. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, feeling disrespected and possibly insecure.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's a court order preventing them from giving money to the ex-wife, it's their money to do with as they please. Emotionally, the person might feel it's a way to make up for past mistakes. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because the money is coming from their relationship, and she might feel it's a betrayal. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex-wife is the mother of their children and has been cooperative, giving her money could be seen as a responsible action. However, the girlfriend's reaction is part of the dynamic. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent is purely to support the kids and ex-wife. But if the ex-wife was still in contact and the girlfriend feels it's a conflict of interest, maybe there's a social expectation to consider the current partner's feelings more. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the person is trying to right past wrongs and support their children's mother, especially with the lawyer and family's approval. The girlfriend's anger is a personal conflict, but the ethical responsibility to the ex-wife and children might outweigh that. However, there's a nuance here where the current partner's feelings should be considered, but unless there's a legal or moral obligation to the girlfriend, the author's action is their choice.\n"
