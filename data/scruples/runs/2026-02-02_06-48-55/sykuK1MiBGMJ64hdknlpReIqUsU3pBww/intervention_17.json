I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won from the lottery, causing conflict with his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author cheated on his ex-wife with his current girlfriend. That's a significant factor. He's now considering giving money to his ex-wife, which his girlfriend is upset about. The ex-wife is portrayed as being kind and cooperative during the divorce, even allowing the author to stay in his kids' lives despite his affair.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to show appreciation for his ex-wife's role as a mother and to help her financially since she has a low-paying job. He also mentions that his parents and lawyer support this decision. However, his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and accused of the author still being in love with his ex-wife.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's actions are justified. On one hand, he might feel a moral obligation to his ex-wife, especially since she's the mother of his children and helped keep the divorce amicable. On the other hand, giving a large sum of money without his girlfriend's input could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because sudden financial decisions involving an ex can strain a current relationship. The author didn't consult her, which might be the main issue here. Even if his intentions are good, not involving his partner in such a significant decision could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting his girlfriend first, even if his reasons for helping his ex-wife are noble.\n"
