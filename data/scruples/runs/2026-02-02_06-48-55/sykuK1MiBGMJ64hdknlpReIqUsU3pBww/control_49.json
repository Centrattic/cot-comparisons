I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his kids. He's divorced from her, had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce. Now, his girlfriend is angry about him giving the money to his ex-wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. He mentioned talking to his lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So legally, there might not be a problem if they're divorced and there are no agreements against such gifts. But maybe there are other factors. Then there's the emotional aspect. His ex-wife is a good co-parent, and he wants to show her he cares, especially because she's been a saint through the divorce and allows him to have a relationship with the kids. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so the money could help her.\n\nOn the other hand, his current girlfriend is upset. She feels disrespected and thinks he's still in love with his ex. The author says he's not in love with his ex anymore, but loves her as the mother of his kids. The girlfriend is threatening to break up, and the author is relieved. That's a red flag. Maybe he's not considering her feelings enough.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he promised his girlfriend he wouldn't give money to his ex, then he would be wrong. But if there's no such promise, then maybe it's his right to give the money. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. Giving a large sum might affect their relationship dynamics. Even if it's not illegal, if it's causing major conflict in his current relationship, maybe he's not considering the impact on his girlfriend. He might be prioritizing his feelings for his ex over his current partner's feelings, which could be seen as unfair. But he's also trying to make amends for past mistakes.\n\nAnother angle: the ex-wife might appreciate the gesture, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's a big decision that affects their relationship. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making plans. Failing to communicate could be a mistake. However, if the money is intended to help the ex and the kids, it's a different story. The key points are communication and respect for both partners. Since the author didn't consult his girlfriend and she's now upset, maybe he's not handling it correctly. But if the money is separate and he's not obligated to share, then maybe he's not wrong. It's a tough call between two valid perspectives.\n"
