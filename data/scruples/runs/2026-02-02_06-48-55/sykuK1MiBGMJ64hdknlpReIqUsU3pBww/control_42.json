I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who gave their ex-wife a large sum of money from a lottery win is in the wrong, given that their current girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is divorced from his ex-wife, they have kids together, and the divorce was because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. Now, after winning money, he wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His reasons include wanting to make her life better since she works a low-paying job and to show appreciation for her handling the divorce well. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is angry and wants to break up.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give (like a personal injury settlement or a lottery win that's his alone and not part of marital assets from the divorce), then he can technically give it to whomever he wants. But there's the emotional aspect. The girlfriend feels disrespected because he's giving a large sum to his ex, which might make her feel like he's still emotionally involved or not considering her feelings. The author clarifies he's not in love with the ex anymore, just loves the kids and wants to do something nice.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is valid too. She's his current partner, and big financial decisions can impact their relationship. Even if the money is his, giving away a large portion might not have been discussed first, leading to hurt feelings. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons rooted in gratitude and wanting to support his kids' mother. On the other, the girlfriend's emotional response is hurt, which is a significant part of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamics. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate his intentions with his girlfriend earlier, or maybe not, if he's within his rights to spend his money as he likes.\n\nHmm. The key points are: Did he wrong her by not respecting her feelings? Or is he justified in doing something for his ex-wife? The girlfriend's threat to break up is a strong indicator of the tension here. The author seems to feel that his actions are justified, but the girlfriend feels disrespected. In relationships, respecting each other's feelings is crucial, even if the action is legally or morally okay. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider how his action would affect his current partner, even if the action itself isn't illegal or unethical. But others might argue that he's within his rights to give the money. So it's a bit of a gray area. But in AITA scenarios, the focus is on social norms and interpersonal relationships. Since the girlfriend is the one who is upset and the author is relieved by her threats, it might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not addressing her feelings properly. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if it's about the right to his money, then he's not. But the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, which involves the girlfriend's reaction. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
