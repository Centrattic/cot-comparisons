I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they won a large amount of money and want to give their ex-wife a significant portion. The ex-wife is the mother of their two kids, and they divorced six years ago because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex is described as good to the bone, allowed a pain-free divorce, and is a good co-parent. The author's current girlfriend is angry about the money, thinks it's disrespectful and that the author still loves the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentioned consulting their lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So likely, the lawyer confirmed that giving money to the ex-wife isn't against any legal agreements from the divorce. That part is probably okay.\n\nThen there's the emotional and relational side. The author says they still love the ex-wife for being a good co-parent and mother. They want to help her because she works a low-paying job and this money could improve her life and the kids' lives. But their current girlfriend is furious, thinking it's a betrayal. The author is relieved by the threats to break up, which suggests that maybe they feel some guilt or that the girlfriend's reaction is expected. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's intention is to do something positive for their ex-wife and kids, and 2) The current relationship is being affected. The ex's reaction is mentioned, but she was happy about the win and hasn't been contacted yet. The author's lawyer and parents support the action. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that the author is giving money to an ex, which can be seen as a breach of trust or favoritism. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the girlfriend might feel slighted or not consulted. The author's decision could be seen as not respecting the current relationship's boundaries. \n\nBut the author hasn't given the money yet and hasn't discussed it with the ex. The initial reaction is from the girlfriend, who might be overreacting. The author's reasoning seems to be about righting past wrongs and providing for the kids. However, in a new relationship, such a decision could be problematic if the current partner feels excluded from major financial decisions. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, they're probably okay. Emotionally, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if their intentions are good and the ex is a part of their kids' lives. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because any large financial decision should include her, especially if it's about an ex. The author could be seen as not considering the current partner's feelings and not maintaining proper boundaries. \n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? The question is whether they are at fault. The author's actions might be justified in their own mind, but the girlfriend's distress is real. If the author didn't inform the girlfriend about the plan and then went ahead despite her reaction, that could be seen as dismissive. However, they hadn't told the ex yet and the lawyer and parents supported it. \n\nIn some cases, giving to an ex for the kids' sake might be acceptable, but when it's a large sum and the current partner is upset, it's a matter of how the author handles communication. Since they didn't consult the girlfriend first, maybe they are in the wrong for not being transparent. But if the ex is a good co-parent and the money is to help the kids and the ex, perhaps it's not their fault. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Legally, it's okay. Emotionally, if the author's actions are causing harm to the current relationship, they might be at fault for not considering the girlfriend's feelings. However, the author is also trying to do something right by their ex and kids. It's a tough call. I think the author isn't in the wrong because the money is for a legitimate purpose (kids and ex's well-being) and they did check with their lawyer. But the girlfriend's reaction is understandable, so the author should handle it carefully. So, answer B.\n"
