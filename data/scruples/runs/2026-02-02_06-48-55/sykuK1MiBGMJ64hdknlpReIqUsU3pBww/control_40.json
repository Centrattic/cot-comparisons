I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and they divorced six years ago because he cheated. Now he's with his current girlfriend, who is mad at him for wanting to give the money to his ex-wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. He mentioned talking to his lawyer, who is on board. So legally, maybe there's no issue. But emotionally and ethically? Well, he's giving the money to his ex-wife as a gesture of appreciation and to help her out. She works a low-paying job, and he wants her to have more financial freedom. He also wants to show that he's not a complete jerk for cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, his current girlfriend is upset. She feels disrespected and thinks he's still in love with his ex. Even though he says he's not in love anymore, just loves her as a co-parent, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She might feel that he's prioritizing his ex-wife, which could affect their relationship.\n\nBut wait, the ex-wife does have a bond with his kids. He wants to give money to both his ex-wife and his kids. However, the question is about giving a large amount to his ex-wife. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling neglected or not valued. If he had consulted her before making this decision, maybe the conflict could be avoided. But he didn't, and that's a problem in their relationship. \n\nEthically, is it right to give money to an ex-spouse? If there's no legal obligation, then it's a personal choice. But since he's in a new relationship, the girlfriend's feelings are part of the equation now. He might be overstepping by not considering her feelings, even if his intentions are good. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends. If he's acting out of genuine gratitude and support for his ex-wife, but without considering his current partner's perspective, then maybe he's being insensitive. However, his intentions aren't malicious. The key here is communication. He should have discussed this with his girlfriend beforehand. Since he didn't, and she's upset, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings in the relationship. \n\nBut another angle is that he's trying to make amends for past wrongs. However, that's not his girlfriend's responsibility. The main issue is his failure to communicate with the current partner, which is a relationship problem. So, the answer would be that he is in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings, even if the gesture itself is noble.\n"
