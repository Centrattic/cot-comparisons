I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money they won, despite their girlfriend's anger. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The man won a significant amount of money. He's considering giving a large sum to his ex-wife, the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex is described as saint-like, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives and keeping the divorce amicable. The ex works a low-paying job, and he wants to help her. His girlfriend is furious, thinks he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, the main points here are about financial responsibility, emotional loyalty, and whether it's appropriate to give such a gift. The author feels he's doing the right thing to show appreciation and support, but the girlfriend sees it as a betrayal.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the ex is the mother of his children, and he's trying to make amends for past mistakes. The ex's actions post-divorce support the idea that she's been cooperative and kind. Giving her money could be seen as a way to provide for the kids and support her financially, which might be a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is his current partner, and giving away a large sum without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships often involve shared financial decisions, especially when it comes to major expenditures. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling unvalued or disrespected, especially given the history of the affair. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex anymore, the girlfriend might perceive this action as prioritizing the ex over her.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author consulted with the ex first. He mentioned he hasn't discussed it with her yet, but his parents and lawyer are on board. However, the girlfriend is the one who's currently in the relationship, and her feelings are valid. The author's plans could disrupt their relationship, which is a significant factor.\n\nAlso, the amount of money is \"a fuck you amount,\" which is substantial. Decisions about such money typically require careful consideration of all stakeholders. The author might be right in wanting to support his ex and kids, but he needs to consider the impact on his current relationship. If the girlfriend feels betrayed, this could lead to long-term issues or a breakup, which might not be fair to her.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between familial obligations and the expectations within a current relationship. The author's intentions are good, but the method\u2014giving a large sum without discussing it with his partner\u2014might be problematic. It's possible he's in the right for wanting to support his ex and children, but the way he's handling it could be seen as wrong because it disregards his girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action itself is wrong versus the manner in which it's executed. If he were to communicate better and maybe find a way that satisfies both his desire to help the ex and respects his girlfriend's boundaries, that would be ideal. But as it stands, he's causing conflict by making a major financial decision without considering his partner's perspective.\n"
