I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he won a large amount of money, and he wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. His current girlfriend is really upset about this. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the ex-wife and the girlfriend. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and the divorce happened because he had an affair with his current partner. That's a big deal. The ex-wife was understanding and let him maintain a relationship with the kids, even though it was painful for her. Now, he wants to give her money as a gesture of appreciation and to make up for his past mistakes.\n\nBut the girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected, and might break up with him. The author says he doesn't love the ex-wife anymore, but he still cares about her. The question is whether giving her a large amount of money is wrong.\n\nFrom one perspective, the ex-wife is part of his life because of the kids. Supporting her could be seen as a responsible gesture, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer agree with him, so there's some external validation. But his current partner is upset, which adds to the tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is his current partner, and she's the one he's in a relationship with now. Giving a large sum to an ex-wife could be seen as prioritizing past relationships over the current one. Even if there's no romantic intention, the girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her by making such a decision without her input. Financial decisions like this can be sensitive in a relationship, especially when it affects how resources are allocated.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the author and the impact on the current relationship. He wants to do something good for his ex-wife, but he hasn't discussed it with his girlfriend, leading to her anger. The question is whether the act itself is wrong or if the way he handled it (not discussing with his girlfriend) is the issue. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for giving the money, not the communication.\n\nIf the author's actions are considered wrong, it might be because he's giving a large amount to an ex, which could be seen as inappropriate in the context of his current relationship. However, if his intentions are genuine and to support both his ex-wife and his children, some might argue it's not wrong. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that it's causing harm to their relationship. \n\nIn relationships, financial decisions can be a big deal. Even if he has good intentions towards his ex-wife, the fact that it's causing conflict with his current partner is significant. It's possible that the author is being selfish by not considering how this would affect his girlfriend, even if his reasons are noble. \n\nBut then again, the ex-wife's role as the mother and the author's desire to make amends for past mistakes complicates things. There's a balance between responsibility to the ex-wife and the current partner. The author's decision might not be malicious, but the act of giving a large sum to an ex, especially after an affair, might be seen as problematic by the current partner. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because the action, while well-intentioned, is causing significant distress to his current partner without her consent or consideration of their relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in the sense that she might feel disrespected or that her partner is not prioritizing her in a meaningful way. The author didn't take her feelings into account, which is a relationship issue. Therefore, even if the action is understandable, the way it's handled without communication could be where the wrong lies.\n"
