I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a large amount of money to their ex-wife after a lottery win, which is causing conflict with their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is a good co-parent and works a low-paying job. He wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery winnings to help her out. His girlfriend is furious, thinks it's disrespectful and that he's still in love with his ex. The author says he's not in love with his ex anymore but still cares. The parents and lawyer support him, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is trying to make amends for past mistakes by helping his ex-wife financially. The ex-wife is in a better position to help the kids, which is a valid reason. However, the author is in a new relationship where this decision is causing conflict. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid emotion. \n\nBut the author hasn't consulted his girlfriend about this decision, which could be seen as a lack of communication. However, the ex-wife is a parent of his children, and providing financial support for them could be justified. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the ex is being prioritized over her, even if the author isn't in love with his ex anymore. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to do something good for his ex-wife and their children, which is understandable. But he might have failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings. However, the main issue is whether he's obligated to consult his girlfriend before making such a decision. Since the ex-wife is a parent, it's a matter of child support or ensuring the kids' well-being, which the author is entitled to consider. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong in giving to his ex-wife, especially since it's for the kids and the ex's benefit. The lawyer and parents supporting it suggest it's a legal and family-approved action.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is making a morally good choice to support his children and ex-wife, even though the communication with his girlfriend could be better. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't ethically wrong for doing something good for the kids and the ex.\n"
