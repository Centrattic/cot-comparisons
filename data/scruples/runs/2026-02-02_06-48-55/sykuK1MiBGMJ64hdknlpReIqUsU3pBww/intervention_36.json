I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author giving a large sum of money to their ex-wife despite their girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is described as a good person and a good co-parent, but she doesn't talk to the girlfriend. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large portion to his ex-wife, mostly out of guilt and to help her and their kids. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex-wife and feels disrespected. The author's parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's intention is to make amends for past mistakes and support the kids, which is commendable. However, the issue here is that the ex-wife is married to someone else now (the author is with his current girlfriend). By giving money to the ex-wife, is he interfering in their current relationships? The ex-wife and the author are divorced, but the girlfriend might feel that the author is still emotionally attached or treating the ex-wife preferentially. \n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's perspective. She might feel that the author is prioritizing his ex-wife over her, especially since the ex-wife doesn't even talk to her. The author's actions could be seen as unfair or disrespectful to his current partner. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex-wife, the act of giving a large sum could be perceived as a breach of trust or emotional disloyalty, especially in the context of their ongoing relationship.\n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, then he might have the right to do so. But the social and emotional implications are different. The girlfriend's anger is valid because the author's decision affects their relationship dynamics. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before making this decision, which shows a lack of communication and consideration. \n\nThe ex-wife's situation is also important. The author wants to help her financially, but she might not need or want the money. Plus, there's a risk of the ex-wife and girlfriend's relationship being further strained, which could complicate co-parenting.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is making a personal choice, but relationships involve mutual respect and communication. By not discussing this with his girlfriend and proceeding despite her objections, he's being inconsiderate towards her feelings. Even if the author's intentions are good, the execution lacks transparency and respect for his current partner's emotions.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be noble, the way he handled the situation could be seen as wrong because it disregards his girlfriend's feelings and the potential consequences on their relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
