I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author won a large sum of money and decided to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, which made his current girlfriend very upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex. The ex has been cooperative and kind post-divorce. Now, the author wants to give her money as a gesture of appreciation and to help her out financially. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a sign the author still loves the ex.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's ex is the mother of his kids, and he's trying to show gratitude for her role in the children's lives and her forgiveness. Financial support could help her with her job and allow her to pursue hobbies. The ex was the first person he called, showing a positive relationship. The author is consulting with his parents and lawyer, which adds a layer of legitimacy to his decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected and possibly jealous. The author hasn't discussed this with her, leading to her anger. The key here is whether it's wrong to give money to an ex-spouse without consulting the current partner. Relationships often require communication, so not discussing such a significant decision with the partner is a red flag. However, the author's intentions seem genuine and not about romantic feelings but about appreciation and responsibility towards his children's mother.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are morally wrong. From a moral standpoint, helping someone who has been a positive co-parent might be seen as right. However, in the context of a current relationship, not involving the partner in such a major decision could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because it affects their relationship dynamics and trust.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: if the author's intention is purely to support his ex and children, it's understandable. But causing his current partner distress by making a unilateral decision might be where the mistake lies. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to help his ex, but he's in the wrong for not considering his partner's feelings and not involving her in the decision-making process. The girlfriend's reaction is valid as it affects their relationship, and the author's failure to communicate is a key issue here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about such a significant financial decision, which is crucial in a relationship, even though his intentions towards his ex were good.\n"
