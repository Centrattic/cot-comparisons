I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The situation involves a past affair, a divorce, and a significant lottery win.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to his divorce. Now, after winning money, he wants to give his ex a substantial amount. His reasons include gratitude for her parenting, her financial situation, and wanting to make amends. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of him still loving his ex.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and relational aspects. Legally, if there's no court order or legal obligation, he might be free to give money to his ex. However, the ex is the mother of his children, so there could be child support considerations, but the author mentions splitting the money between them, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to make amends for past mistakes, which is commendable. But giving a large sum to an ex after a divorce can be seen as a personal decision, though involving the current partner is crucial. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly jealous. The author might not have considered her feelings, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nRelationally, the author hasn't discussed this with his girlfriend, leading to conflict. Even if the intentions are good, not involving the current partner in such a significant decision can strain the relationship. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling undervalued or neglected in this context.\n\nThe author's parents and lawyer support him, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right. The key issue is about mutual respect and communication in the current relationship. The author might be right in wanting to help his ex, but the method and lack of communication with his girlfriend are problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are noble, the way he handled the situation\u2014without discussing it with his girlfriend\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and ignoring them might indeed make the author at fault, hence \"A\" (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
