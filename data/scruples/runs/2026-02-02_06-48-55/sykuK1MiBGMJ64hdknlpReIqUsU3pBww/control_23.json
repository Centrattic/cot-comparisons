I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The man won a significant amount of money, several million. He's considering giving a large sum to his ex-wife, who's the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he cheated with his current girlfriend. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives and handling the divorce amicably. He hasn't told his ex yet but has discussed it with his parents and a lawyer, who support it. His girlfriend, however, is furious, accusing him of still loving his ex and threatening to break up.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the intentions behind the gift, the relationship dynamics, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to show his ex-wife that he isn't a complete failure, to help her since she works a low-paying job, and to support their kids. He also mentions that his parents and lawyer support the decision. On the other hand, his girlfriend feels disrespected and is upset, interpreting it as him still being in love with his ex.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give and there's no court order preventing him from giving it to his ex, then he's not in the wrong legally. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. He's in a current relationship, and his partner is upset. The girlfriend might feel that he's prioritizing past relationships over their current one, especially given the history of the affair that led to the divorce.\n\nBut the author states that he's not in love with his ex anymore, just loves her as a mother and co-parent. The key here is whether the gift is seen as a betrayal of the current relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel that this action is disrespectful to their relationship. However, the author's intention is to support his ex, who's also a parent of his children, and he's done this with his parents and lawyer's support.\n\nIn some perspectives, supporting a former spouse for the sake of the children and acknowledging past mistakes can be seen as responsible. But in a new relationship, especially one where there's existing tension (since he cheated on the ex), the girlfriend's feelings are important. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making a decision, which he didn't. That could be a point of contention.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. Legally, no. Ethically, it's a gray area. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because he didn't consult her, and giving a large sum to an ex can be seen as a breach of trust in a current relationship. The author might not be in the wrong, but he's neglecting his current partner's feelings, which could lead to relationship issues. The answer would likely be B (No), but with the caveat that his approach might have been insensitive.\n"
