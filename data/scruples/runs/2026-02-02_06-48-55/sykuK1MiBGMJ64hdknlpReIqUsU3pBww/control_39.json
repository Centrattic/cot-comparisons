I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which his girlfriend is really upset about. He's also considering breaking up with her because he feels relieved by her threats. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. He had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex-wife is characterized as a saint, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives and keeping the divorce amicable. He wants to give her money to show he cares and because she works a low-paying job. His girlfriend is angry, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves his ex. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's trying to make amends for his past mistakes by helping the mother of his children. He's considering their well-being, and his parents and lawyer support him. On the other hand, his girlfriend feels disrespected. The act of giving a large sum to an ex-wife might be seen as a breach of trust or boundary in the current relationship. \n\nHe mentions he's not in love with his ex anymore but still loves her as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because unexpected big financial decisions can cause jealousy or insecurity. However, his intention is to support the kids and ex-wife's financial situation. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of current relationship dynamics. If he didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first, maybe he should have, as it's a major life decision that affects both partners. However, the ex-wife already agreed to amicable terms, and the money isn't for him but for her and the kids' benefit. \n\nI think the key here is whether he respected his girlfriend's feelings and communicated properly. Since he didn't discuss it with her before, and she's upset, but his intentions are good. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say he's in the right because he's helping his ex-wife and kids, while others might say he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because his actions are motivated by genuine reasons (supporting family) and not romantic feelings. However, he could have handled the communication better with his girlfriend. But given the scenario, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
