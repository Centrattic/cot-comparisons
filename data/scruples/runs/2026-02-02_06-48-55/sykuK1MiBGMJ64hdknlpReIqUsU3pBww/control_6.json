I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, who's in a relationship now, recently won a large sum of money. They want to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, who's the mother of their two kids. The ex-wife was understanding during the divorce (caused by the author's affair with the current girlfriend), and the author feels a sense of responsibility to help her financially. However, the girlfriend is furious, thinks it's disrespectful, and is threatening to break up.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical and relational aspects. \n\n1. **Legal Aspects**: The author consulted with their lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So legally, it might be okay, but that's not the main question here. The question is about moral wrong, not legal.\n\n2. **Moral Responsibility to Ex-Wife**: The ex-wife is the mother of their children and was a good co-parent despite the divorce being the author's fault. The author feels they should help her because she works a low-paying job and this could improve her life. Also, the author wants to show care and make up for past mistakes. \n\n3. **Relationship with Current GF**: The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected. The author doesn't say they're still in love with the ex, but the girlfriend interprets this as lingering feelings. The author is considering going through with the plan despite the girlfriend's anger. \n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it wrong to help a former spouse, especially for the children's sake? The author is providing for their kids by supporting both parents. But the girlfriend's feelings are a factor here. \n\nPossible angles: \n- The author is right in wanting to support their ex-wife and children, even after the divorce. The affair was the author's fault, so they have a responsibility. \n- On the other hand, the author is in a current relationship, and giving a large sum to an ex might be seen as emotionally insensitive, especially since the girlfriend is part of the current life. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid as she could feel betrayed or disrespected by the decision without her input. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't breaking the law, and their intentions are to help their ex and children. However, the relationship with the current partner is a different context. The girlfriend's emotional response is a valid part of the equation. The author might be neglecting the emotional impact on their current partner by not considering how this decision affects their relationship. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The author is prioritizing their children and ex-wife's well-being, which is understandable. But the girlfriend's feelings matter too. The author might be wrong in not considering the girlfriend's perspective more, but the act itself isn't necessarily morally wrong. It's more about the relationship dynamics and communication. \n\nAnother angle: The author is in a new relationship, and the ex-wife is not part of the current life. The girlfriend might see this as favoring the ex, even if the author isn't in love with her. The author might be wrong in not addressing the girlfriend's concerns adequately before proceeding. However, the author's decision is based on a sense of responsibility towards their children and ex-wife. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong morally for wanting to help their ex-wife, but they could be in the wrong relationally by not considering the girlfriend's feelings enough. Since the question is about whether they're in the wrong in general, the answer could be B (No), because their intentions are good and they're helping family. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the action is seen as disrespectful to the current partner. \n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are legally and morally justified from their perspective (helping family), but the relational aspect is complex. Since the girlfriend is threatening to break up, the author might need to consider that the action could be harmful to their current relationship. But the author isn't obligated to prioritize the girlfriend over their children and ex-wife. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting out of a sense of duty and care for their children and ex-wife.\n"
