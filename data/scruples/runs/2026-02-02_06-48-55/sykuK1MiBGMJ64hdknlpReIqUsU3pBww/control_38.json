I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife after winning the lottery, which made his girlfriend angry and led to a potential breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. The author is giving money to his ex-wife, who he still respects and loves as the mother of his children. He mentions that she's been a saint during the divorce and co-parenting, which suggests a positive history. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a sign of lingering love, but the author clarifies he's not in love with his ex, just loves her as a co-parent. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a key point. The author's actions could be seen as generous but might be perceived as neglecting his current relationship. However, since the money is from his own win, he isn't legally obligated to share it, so it's his to give. But relationships often aren't just about legalities\u2014they're about emotions and trust. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which is a valid emotional concern. \n\nNext, possible legal implications: The author consulted his lawyer, who was surprised but okay with it. If the money is given as a gift without any legal obligations, it's his to distribute. But if there's a prenuptial agreement or other legal claims from the current relationship, that might complicate things. The scenario doesn't mention that, so maybe it's not a factor here.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. He's making a choice based on his feelings of gratitude and wanting to support his ex-wife, which can be seen as commendable. However, not discussing it with his girlfriend before deciding could be a misstep. In a relationship, transparency and communication are important. Even if it's his money, a significant gift to an ex might affect the current partner, and involving them in the decision could prevent hurt feelings.\n\nBut the author's intention is to acknowledge his past and support his kids' mother. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the money could improve her life. The girlfriend might feel that this favoritism is unfair, especially if there are ongoing emotional attachments. However, the author says he's not in love with his ex anymore, which could mitigate that concern. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, screaming and threatening a breakup. That might indicate deeper issues in their relationship, such as trust or jealousy. The author's relief at the threats is concerning, as it suggests he's not as committed to the relationship. This could imply that the relationship is already strained, and his decision to proceed with the gift without addressing her concerns might be a contributing factor.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but emotionally and relationally, he might have a responsibility to communicate with his girlfriend. The girlfriend's overreaction is valid from her perspective, but the author's decision to share the money as a gesture of care is also understandable. The key issue is the lack of communication and how the girlfriend feels disrespected. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because of the relational impact, or B (not in the wrong) since it's his money and his ex's well-being. But given that he's considering the girlfriend's feelings and the lawyer's approval, maybe B is more accurate. However, the fact that he's not considering her feelings and is relieved by the breakup might tip it towards A. Hmm, tricky.\n"
