I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. Hmm. So the situation is that he won a significant amount of money, around millions. He wants to give a substantial part to his ex-wife, who he's divorced for six years but still has kids with. The ex-wife is described as amazing and a saint, handling the divorce well despite his affair with the current girlfriend. The girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex, but the author says he's not, just has respect for her as a mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The author is giving money to an ex-spouse, which can be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected, which is a valid concern. Even if the author isn't in love anymore, the girlfriend might feel neglected or that he's prioritizing someone else's needs over hers. On the other hand, the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and the author feels it's a way to show appreciation and support for her. Also, the ex-wife works a low-paying job, so the money could improve her life.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the author's actions are wrong. From a relationship perspective, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The author didn't consult her before making this decision, which could be seen as a breach of communication. Even if the money isn't meant for the ex-wife, the girlfriend might feel it's a betrayal. However, the author's intention was to acknowledge the ex-wife's sacrifices and support their children. The ex-wife didn't ask for the money but was happy about the win.\n\nThere's also the legal aspect mentioned. The lawyer was surprised but on board, so maybe there's no legal issue. But morally, it's more about the relationship dynamics. The author's parents support him, which adds another layer. The girlfriend's threat to break up shows the conflict is significant.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, giving money to an ex can be controversial. Some might see it as generous and right, especially for the children's sake. Others might see it as irresponsible or disrespectful to the current partner. The author's motivation is to make amends, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of feeling disrespected. \n\nThe answer would depend on whose perspective you take. If the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. The author might not be wrong in his reasoning, but his actions have caused harm to the current relationship. So, he might not be in the wrong from a moral standpoint of helping the ex-wife, but he is in the wrong in terms of respecting his girlfriend's feelings and considering the dynamics of their relationship. However, the original question asks if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to decide based on the context.\n"
