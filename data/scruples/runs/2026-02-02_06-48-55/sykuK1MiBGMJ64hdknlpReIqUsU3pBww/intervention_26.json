I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, who he divorced six years ago due to his affair with his current girlfriend. His girlfriend is angry and threatening to break up, while his parents and lawyer support him. The author is conflicted but insists he's not in love with his ex, just wants to help his kids' mother and show he's not a complete mess.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical implications. The key points here are: 1) The money is his to give, as he won it. 2) His ex-wife is a good co-parent and he's trying to make amends. 3) His current relationship is strained over this decision. \n\nOn one hand, he has a right to his money and can choose to give it to whomever he wants. He's trying to support his children's mother, which is a valid reason. His ex-wife's job is low-paying, so this could improve her life. His parents and lawyer think it's a good idea, which adds some external validation.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected and possibly replaced or neglected. Even if he's not in love with his ex, giving her a large sum might make the girlfriend feel insecure or like he's not prioritizing their relationship. The fact that his ex refuses to talk to his girlfriend might complicate things further, as it could create tension or resentment.\n\nThe author mentions feeling relieved about the breakup threats, which suggests he might have underlying issues with the current relationship. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not about the relationship's viability.\n\nConsidering that the money is his and the ex-wife's role as the mother of his children, his decision isn't inherently unethical. However, not involving the girlfriend in this decision without prior discussion might be a mistake. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication errors. \n\nHis ex-wife's acceptance of the money could also be a factor. If she refuses it, he might need to reconsider, but since she's open to the idea (as she's happy about the potential for the kids), it seems okay. The main ethical issue is whether giving the money is appropriate. Since he's using it to support his children and ex-wife's well-being, it's a positive action. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than the action itself being wrong. The author's intention is to do good, but the conflict with his partner complicates things. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to help his ex-wife; the problem lies in the relationship dynamics, not the act of giving the money. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he has the right to his money and his intentions are valid. The girlfriend's reaction is a relationship issue but doesn't make him the asshole for this decision.\n"
