I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. His current girlfriend is upset about this, thinking he's disrespecting her or still in love with his ex. The author claims he's not in love with the ex anymore but still wants to help her because she's the mother of his kids and he feels guilty for the affair that caused the divorce.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intentions. He mentions that he wants to show his ex that he cares despite his past mistakes. He also notes that she works a low-paying job and this money could help her. His parents and lawyer support him, so there's some external validation. However, the girlfriend is his current partner, and her reaction is anger and feeling disrespected. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, giving a large sum of money to an ex might be seen as inappropriate, especially if it causes conflict with the current partner. Even if the author's intentions are good, the action could be perceived as a betrayal or lack of respect for the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a valid emotional response. The author didn't consult her, which might have been a misstep. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a responsibility towards his children and might feel a duty to support both the mother and his kids. The ex is cooperative in co-parenting, which is admirable. The author's desire to make amends for his past actions could be genuine. However, the way he's handling it\u2014without discussing it with his current partner\u2014might be where the problem lies. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings before making this decision, that could be a point against him.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are respectful to both his ex and his current partner. While helping his ex and children is commendable, the method and communication around it are crucial. The girlfriend's feeling that she's being disrespected might stem from not being involved in the decision-making process. The author might be prioritizing his past relationship in a way that undermines his current one, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about such a significant decision, which could harm their relationship. Even though his intentions towards his ex and kids are good, the way he's handling it without his partner's input is problematic. Therefore, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
