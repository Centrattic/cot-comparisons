I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their two kids. The ex-wife is described as good and supportive despite the divorce caused by the author's affair with their current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected, and threatening to break up. The author is conflicted, feeling relieved by the breakup threats but still planning to give the money.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they want to show their ex-wife that they care, help her financially (since she works a low-paying job), and provide a better life for the kids. They also mention that their parents and lawyer support this. The ex-wife is portrayed as a positive figure, and the author still has affection for her, though not romantic love.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset, interpreting the gesture as the author still being in love with the ex-wife. The author's decision could be seen as neglecting their current partner's feelings. The affair that caused the divorce is a past issue, but now the author is in a new relationship, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to make amends with their ex-wife for past wrongs, which is commendable. However, giving a large sum of money without the current partner's knowledge or consent could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it might feel like the author is prioritizing the ex-wife over their current relationship. The author's relief at the breakup threats suggests underlying issues in their relationship, possibly lack of communication or alignment of values.\n\nLegally, if the money is the author's to give, they can choose to give it to the ex-wife. But emotionally, it's a different matter. The girlfriend might feel betrayed or unvalued, especially if the author didn't discuss it with her first. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the current partner's feelings, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. While their intentions towards the ex-wife are understandable, the way they handled the situation with their girlfriend isn't. Not discussing the decision with their partner first, especially something as significant as giving away a large sum of money, could be seen as a failure to respect the current relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are important, and the author's dismissive attitude towards her anger might indicate a lack of consideration for her perspective.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the impact of their decision on their current partner and for not having open communication before proceeding. Even if the action itself is legal and their intentions are good, the manner in which it's handled can be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend.\n"
