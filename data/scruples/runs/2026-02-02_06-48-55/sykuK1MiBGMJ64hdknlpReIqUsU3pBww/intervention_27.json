I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a portion to his ex-wife. He had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce. His ex-wife is described as kind, and he still feels a connection because she's the mother of his kids. He consulted his parents and lawyer, who supported the idea. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he's still in love with his ex.\n\nSo, the main question is whether giving money to a former spouse is wrong, especially after an affair. The author's intentions are to right a past wrong and help his kids' mother. But the girlfriend feels disrespected. \n\nLegally, if the money is from the author's own winnings and not marital property, he has the right to do that. The ex-wife didn't ask for it, so it's a gesture. Emotionally, the girlfriend might feel insecure or see it as favoring the ex. The author claims he's not in love with the ex but respects her as a co-parent. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to his money, the ex-wife's deserving nature, the intention to help, and the girlfriend's reaction. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of feeling disrespected, but the author's actions might not be wrong if done with good intentions and without legal issues. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's acting from a place of gratitude and wanting to support the mother of his children. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important. The author might need to communicate better, but the act itself isn't inherently wrong. So, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
