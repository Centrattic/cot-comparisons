I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a large amount of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery. The writer is considering giving a significant portion to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his kids, despite his current girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex-wife was understanding during the divorce because of his affair with the current girlfriend. She's still involved in the kids' lives and is seen as a good co-parent. The writer feels he wants to show some appreciation for her past and ongoing support, especially since she works a low-paying job. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex-wife or showing preferential treatment.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the writer might feel that this gesture is a way to make amends for his past mistake. He's trying to do something good for the mother of his children, which could be seen as responsible. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. Giving a large sum without discussing it with her might be seen as disrespectful to their current relationship. \n\nLegally, there might not be an issue if the money is his to give. But emotionally, it's a different story. The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her partner isn't considering her feelings. The writer should have probably had a conversation with his girlfriend before making such a decision to avoid hurting her. \n\nAlso, the ex-wife's reaction isn't mentioned. If she's against it or if there are legal aspects (like child support vs. personal gifts), that could play a role. But based on what's written, the ex-wife seems okay with the money. \n\nSo, the question is whether the writer's action is wrong. If the girlfriend is his current partner and the money is being given without her consent, leading to possible emotional harm, then maybe he is in the wrong in the context of their relationship. But if he's prioritizing the well-being of his children and showing gratitude to his ex-wife, who's a significant part of his kids' lives, then it's more about balancing different responsibilities. \n\nI think the key here is that the writer didn't communicate with his girlfriend first, which caused the conflict. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because he's giving something of significant value to an ex without considering her feelings. So maybe he's in the wrong in terms of relationship dynamics, even if the intention is good. But there's also the argument that he's trying to do right by his children's mother. \n\nHmm, it's a tough call. But I think the main issue is not considering his current partner's feelings. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the intention is to help his ex-wife and kids.\n"
