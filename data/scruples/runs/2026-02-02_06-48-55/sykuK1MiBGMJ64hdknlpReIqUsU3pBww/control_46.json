I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large sum to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife has been supportive with the kids and the divorce process, even though she doesn't talk to his girlfriend. He hasn't discussed this with his ex yet but has spoken to his parents and lawyer, who support it. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected, and threatening to break up. The author is considering going through with it anyway.\n\nNow, the key points here are the motivations and the implications. The author's reasons for giving the money are to show appreciation for his ex-wife's support and to help her financially since she works a low-paying job. He also wants to provide for their children. On the other hand, his girlfriend feels disrespected and accuses him of still loving his ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with her anymore but still loves her as a mother and co-parent.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few angles. Legally, if the money is his to give (as in, it's his personal winnings and not part of any legal agreement with the ex-wife), then he has the right to give it away. However, there's the ethical aspect. Giving money to an ex-wife, especially after a divorce influenced by an affair with the new partner, can be seen as insensitive or disrespectful to the current partner. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration for each other's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because unexpected large financial commitments to an ex can strain trust and emotional bonds in a new relationship.\n\nThe author's intention is to make amends and support his ex and kids, which is noble. However, the method of doing so without considering the current partner's feelings might be problematic. The girlfriend's anger stems from feeling slighted and possibly fearing that the ex-wife still holds a special place in his life. Even if the author isn't in love anymore, the act of giving such a large sum can be perceived as showing favoritism or not prioritizing the current relationship.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first, which is a key step in maintaining trust. He did talk to his parents and lawyer, which is good for legal advice, but the emotional impact on his girlfriend wasn't addressed. In relationships, transparency is crucial. By not involving his girlfriend in the decision-making process, he might have overlooked her perspective and feelings, leading to conflict.\n\nAdditionally, the affair that caused the initial divorce is a sensitive point. The ex-wife was hurt by the affair, but handled the divorce gracefully. The author's desire to make amends is understandable, but it's important to balance that with the current partner's feelings. The girlfriend might feel that he's prioritizing past relationships over the present one, which could undermine her sense of security in the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are to support his ex-wife and children, the way he's approaching it without considering his current partner's feelings and without open communication might place him in the wrong. The ethical considerations here involve respecting current relationship dynamics and ensuring that both partners feel valued and heard. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he disregarded his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate properly, which is a breach of consideration in a relationship.\n"
