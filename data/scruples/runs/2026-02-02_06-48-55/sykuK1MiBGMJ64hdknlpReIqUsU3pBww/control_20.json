I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his two kids. The ex-wife was actually quite understanding during the divorce when he had an affair with his current girlfriend. Now, the ex-wife is doing a low-paying job, and the author wants to help her out, maybe as a way to make up for past mistakes. But his current girlfriend is upset and threatening to break up with him because she feels disrespected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. He mentions that he still loves his ex-wife but isn't in love with her. He wants to give her money to show he cares and to help her and the kids. His parents and lawyer support him, which might indicate that there's some legitimacy to his reasoning. But the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she's livid and feels disrespected. \n\nNow, from the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that he's prioritizing his ex-wife over her. Even if he's not in love anymore, giving a large sum of money to an ex could be seen as a breach of loyalty. She's his current partner, and such a significant gesture might make her feel insecure or unvalued. It's important to note that the author hasn't discussed this with his ex-wife yet, so she's not aware of the plans either. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions could be seen as a way to right past wrongs. The ex-wife was the one who allowed a smooth divorce and maintained a good relationship for the kids. The money might help her and provide a better life for the children. However, the author's decision to give the money without consulting his girlfriend raises questions about communication and respect in his current relationship. \n\nThe key points here are about intent and the impact on relationships. The author's intent is to make amends and help his ex-wife, but the method might be causing harm to his current relationship. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected might be valid if she feels that the author is showing favoritism or not considering her feelings. \n\nI should also consider if there are any legal issues, but the author mentioned that his lawyer is on board, so that's probably not a factor here. The main issue is the emotional and relational aspect. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, giving money to an ex-spouse, especially for the benefit of children, is often seen as a responsible action. However, the way it's handled in the context of a new relationship can be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that she might not feel secure in the relationship, and the author's decision not to adjust his plans despite her feelings could be seen as dismissive of her perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to do something good for his ex-wife and kids. On the other, his current partner is feeling hurt and disrespected. The author might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings more and for not finding a way to address both parties' needs. However, his intentions are noble, which complicates the matter. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's actions could be seen as a form of emotional neglect towards his current partner. Even if the ex-wife deserves the money, the method of giving it without considering the current partner's feelings could be problematic. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, and the author's decision might be lacking in that regard. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the way he's handling the situation might be causing unnecessary conflict in his current relationship. He might be in the wrong for not balancing both his ex-wife's needs and his girlfriend's feelings adequately.\n"
