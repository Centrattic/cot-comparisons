I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and they divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife has been cooperative with co-parenting and is a good person, but she doesn't talk to the girlfriend. The girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex, even though he claims he's not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the ex-wife's situation. She's the mother of his children, and he feels a sense of responsibility. He wants to give her money as a gesture of goodwill, especially since she's in a low-paying job. He's also considering his children's well-being. That makes sense from a parental responsibility standpoint. He didn't include the girlfriend in this decision, which might be a problem because in a current relationship, major financial decisions can affect the partner. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly feeling that he's still emotionally connected to his ex-wife, which might be true if he's choosing to give her money over his current partner.\n\nHowever, the author did consult his parents and lawyer, who supported him. His lawyer's opinion is important because there could be legal implications, especially regarding child support or custody. If the ex-wife is already receiving child support, giving her additional money might not be necessary and could be seen as an obligation rather than a generous gesture. But the author's intention is to help her financially, so that's different from legal obligations.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger is valid because she's his current partner, and sharing a significant portion of a windfall without her input can be seen as a breach of trust. In a relationship, partners typically expect to discuss major financial decisions together. The author's decision to give the money without her knowledge might be seen as disregarding her feelings and the partnership they're supposed to have.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasons are rooted in gratitude and a desire to make amends for past mistakes. He's trying to do the right thing by his children's mother and support her financially. But the way he's handling it could be seen as insensitive to his current partner's feelings. There's a conflict between his past and present relationships, and how he prioritizes them.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally, if the money is his to give and the ex-wife isn't receiving it as part of any legal agreement, then he might be within his rights. Emotionally and relationally, though, not consulting his girlfriend is a mistake. In a committed relationship, major financial decisions should be mutual. By giving the money without discussing it with her, he's showing that he values his ex-wife's feelings more than his current partner's, which can create resentment. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which is a valid concern in a relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider his partner's perspective and feelings in the decision-making process.\n"
