I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money they won from the lottery, despite their girlfriend's anger. The author's reasoning is that they want to show their ex-wife, who's the mother of their kids and worked hard despite the divorce, that they care. The girlfriend is upset, thinking they're still in love with the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the ex-wife and the girlfriend. The ex and the author have a history, including a divorce due to the author's affair with the current girlfriend. The ex is acting as a good co-parent, which the author appreciates. The author wants to give her money as a gesture to help her and the children, even though they haven't discussed it with her yet. \n\nThe girlfriend feels disrespected and thinks the author is still in love with the ex, even though the author clarifies they're not. The author's lawyer and parents support the decision, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up. The author is relieved by this.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. From a financial responsibility standpoint, the author is using their own money, so they have the right to do with it as they please. However, giving a large sum to an ex-wife without considering the current partner's feelings could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the partner feels excluded or undermined. \n\nThe ex-wife's role as a co-parent is important, and helping the children's mother might have valid reasons. However, the author hasn't discussed this with the ex-wife yet, which might be a point against them. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly not being valued. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key. The author may have a good intention, but not involving the current partner in such a significant decision could be seen as dismissive. Even if the money is their own, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is relevant. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's failure to communicate and consider her perspective could be where they're in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's desire to make amends and support their children's other parent might be seen as a positive, but it's important to balance that with the current relationship's needs. The fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds tension, which might affect the perception of the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult their partner before making such a big decision, which can be seen as a breach of trust and consideration. The girlfriend's reaction is a natural response to feeling disrespected, and the author's relief at the breakup suggests underlying issues in the relationship that this action might have exacerbated.\n"
