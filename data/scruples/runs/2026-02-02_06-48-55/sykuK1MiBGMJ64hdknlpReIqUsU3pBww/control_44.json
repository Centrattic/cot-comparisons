I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who gave money to their ex-wife is in the wrong, especially considering their girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The guy won a large sum of money, which he wants to give to his ex-wife, who's the mother of his kids. They divorced because he cheated. The ex-wife was kind during the divorce and allows him to see the kids. He wants to give her money to show appreciation and help her out, and his parents and lawyer support him. His girlfriend is angry and thinks he's disrespecting her or still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the ex-wife is a good co-parent, he's giving her money as a gesture of gratitude, and the girlfriend is upset about it. The question is whether he's wrong in doing so.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if he's given the money through proper channels, like a legal gift, it's probably okay. His lawyer is on board, so maybe there's no legal issue. From a moral perspective, he's trying to make amends for his past by helping her, especially since she's in a financial position where it would help. Also, the ex-wife didn't ask for the money, she was just happy about the win.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. But the man isn't giving the money out of love for the ex-wife, but rather appreciation for her role as a co-parent and for her kindness. However, the girlfriend might feel that this is a betrayal, especially since the ex-wife refuses to talk to her. That could be a red flag. Maybe the girlfriend's insecurities are valid, but the man isn't in the wrong if his intentions are genuine.\n\nBut then again, the act of giving a large sum of money to an ex might create tension in the current relationship. The man isn't in a position to decide what's best for his girlfriend's feelings. However, his actions are his own, as long as there's no legal obligation to the ex-wife. Since he's consulting with his lawyer, perhaps it's okay.\n\nThe key here is the man's intent versus the girlfriend's feelings. If the intent is to help his kids' mother and appreciate her for being a good co-parent, then it's a positive action. The girlfriend's anger might be more about her own insecurities and feeling overshadowed by the ex. The man isn't wrong for wanting to do something good for the ex-wife, especially after his past mistake. Also, considering the ex-wife's financial situation and his role as a father, it's in the kids' best interest to have both parents in a stable position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his intentions are to show appreciation and support for his children's mother, who helped him despite his past mistakes. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of feeling hurt, but the man isn't in the wrong for giving money to his ex-wife.\n"
