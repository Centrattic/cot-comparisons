She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog to help with anxiety, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's care and was reported to HR, and now they're feeling like the villain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog was likely a therapy animal meant to help her cope. Getting a dog can be a valid emotional support animal (ESA) arrangement. However, the author's concern is valid too\u2014leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day might not be ethical, as dogs are social animals that need attention and training.\n\nThe author's sarcastic remarks, while maybe well-intentioned, came across as harsh and dismissive. Instead of addressing the issue constructively, they criticized the coworker publicly, which led to conflict. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially if she's already vulnerable due to her past. The author's comment about Netflix is particularly cutting and could be seen as minimizing the coworker's need for emotional support.\n\nBut then again, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is a point to consider. However, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. Instead of confronting the coworker directly and respectfully, they made sarcastic remarks that others overheard. This led to being reported to HR, which suggests that the workplace saw the comments as harassment, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nThe key here is the method of communication. The author's approach was passive-aggressive and potentially damaging to the coworker's feelings. It's important to address concerns respectfully and privately. Publicly criticizing someone's decision, especially regarding something as sensitive as therapy animals, can be hurtful. The coworker might have felt that her needs were being invalidated, leading her to report the author.\n\nSo, even if the author's concern about the dog's welfare was valid, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their method of handling the situation. They should have approached the coworker privately, expressed their concern about the dog's care without sarcasm, and perhaps suggested alternative solutions like discussing the responsibility of pet ownership before getting a dog.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their comments were inappropriate and contributed to a hostile work environment, even if their concern was valid.\n"
