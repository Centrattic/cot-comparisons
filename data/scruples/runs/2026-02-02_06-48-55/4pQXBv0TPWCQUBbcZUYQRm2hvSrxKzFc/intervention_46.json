She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog, but ends up not being able to care for it properly because of her long hours. The author, another coworker, expressed sarcastic comments about the situation, leading to HR involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety. Her colleagues decided she should get a dog for emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog being left alone for long hours and not being properly trained. The author's sarcastic remarks were about the dog's treatment and suggested giving it to someone else. This led to being reported to HR.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's comments were inappropriate. The author's intention was to point out the problem with the dog's care, but the delivery was sarcastic and possibly harsh. The coworker who got the dog feels attacked, and the author was reported as a result.\n\nNow, considering workplace dynamics, even if the author had valid concerns, the way they expressed it could be seen as unprofessional. Using sarcasm and making jokes about a sensitive topic like someone's emotional support animal might cross a line. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her mental health support, which could be perceived as harassment, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did bring up a legitimate concern about the dog's welfare. However, the method of addressing it was not constructive. Instead of making sarcastic remarks, the author might have approached the situation differently, like offering to help or discussing it privately with the coworker or HR in a more respectful manner.\n\nSo, while the author might have had valid points about the dog's care, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the manner of their comments, even if their intentions were to raise a concern.\n"
