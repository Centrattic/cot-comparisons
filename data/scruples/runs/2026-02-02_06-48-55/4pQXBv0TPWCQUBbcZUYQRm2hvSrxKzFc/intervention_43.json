She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog despite having a very busy schedule, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author of the post got annoyed and made sarcastic comments about giving the dog to someone else, which led to a HR report.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's comments were sarcastic and dismissive, which could come off as harsh or uncaring. However, the coworker's decision to get a dog might not have been the best choice given her work schedule, which could be neglecting the dog's welfare. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's approach. While they might have concerns about the dog's well-being, expressing those concerns in a sarcastic and public manner isn't constructive. The author could have approached the coworker privately to discuss their worries instead of making snide remarks. The coworker, on the other hand, might be struggling with anxiety and using the dog as emotional support, which is a valid need, but the practicality of caring for a dog with her schedule is questionable.\n\nHR intervened because the comment was reported as harassment. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the dog's poor living conditions, the method used could be seen as unprofessional and hurtful. The key here is whether the author's comments crossed the line into harassment. While the concern about the dog's welfare is valid, the way it was communicated led to conflict and HR involvement. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because the coworker's decision to get a dog under those circumstances was impractical. However, the manner in which the author expressed their opinion was inappropriate. It's possible that the author could have raised the issue more respectfully, which might have led to a better outcome without involving HR. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's reaction could be seen as hypersensitive, especially if she's going through a tough time. However, the author's sarcastic remark might not have been the best way to approach the situation. There's a balance between expressing concern and maintaining professionalism. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern about the dog's welfare is understandable, the way they communicated it was unprofessional and contributed to the conflict. The coworker's decision to report the comment as harassment is valid from a workplace perspective, even if the underlying issue is complex. So, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, even if their intentions were to highlight a problem.\n"
