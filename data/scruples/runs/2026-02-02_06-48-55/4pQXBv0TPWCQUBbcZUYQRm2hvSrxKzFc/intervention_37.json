She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, which the author feels is neglectful. The author made sarcastic comments, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, the author's coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and getting a dog was suggested as emotional support. The author is annoyed because the coworker's work schedule leaves the dog alone for long hours, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks about the dog's kennel smell and suggesting giving it away led to being reported.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The coworker's mental health and the dog's purpose as a therapy animal. 2) The author's comments being sarcastic and potentially harsh. 3) The coworker reporting the author for harassment.\n\nI need to consider if the author's comments were justified. While the author has valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was sarcastic and dismissive. The coworker, who has a history of trauma, might be more sensitive to criticism, especially regarding her emotional support. The author's response could be seen as undermining the coworker's efforts to manage her anxiety, even if the author's intent was to highlight the dog's neglect.\n\nAlso, workplace dynamics play a role. The author's comments led to being reported, indicating that the coworker felt harassed. Even if the author believed they were right, the method of communication was inappropriate. It's important to address concerns respectfully rather than through sarcasm, especially in a professional setting.\n\nSo, while the author might have a point about the dog's living conditions, their approach was flawed. The coworker's mental health and the nature of the comments (harsh and dismissive) make the author's actions problematic. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
