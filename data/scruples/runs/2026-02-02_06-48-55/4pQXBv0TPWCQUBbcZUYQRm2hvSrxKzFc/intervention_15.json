She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a therapy dog, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and ends up in a kennel most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about giving the dog to someone else and compared it to Netflix, which led to HR involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. Even if the author thinks the dog isn't being properly cared for, the coworker has a right to have an emotional support animal if it's part of a medical recommendation. The author's comments were sarcastic and direct, which might come off as harsh, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nThe author's concern might be valid\u2014leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day isn't ideal. But the way they expressed their concern was through sarcasm and public criticism, which can be seen as unprofessional. Instead of addressing it privately or suggesting alternatives, they made jokes that were overheard and taken to HR. Even if the author's intentions were to help the dog, the method was inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the coworker reported the author, which complicates things. The author might feel they were being attacked, but in a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism. The fact that the author's comments were taken to HR suggests that the coworker felt harassed, and HR's role is to protect employees from such issues. Even if the coworker has a questionable reason for the dog, the author's response could be seen as targeting her personal choices, which isn't allowed in a professional environment.\n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, their approach was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. They should have addressed the concern in a more constructive and respectful manner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
