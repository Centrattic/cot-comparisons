She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, and the author gets angry about it, leading to HR involvement.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which makes people want to support her by getting a therapy dog. The author is annoyed because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be alone for 14 hours a day. The author says sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the key points here: The coworker has emotional support needs. Therapy animals can be beneficial for mental health. However, the author's comments were sarcastic and dismissive. Even if the author had valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was harsh and public, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author argues they were just speaking the truth, but using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation isn't the right way to address it. The coworker might feel attacked, and the author's comments could be seen as undermining the support the coworker is receiving. Additionally, the author's response was to mock the situation rather than offer constructive help or private advice.\n\nIn a workplace, it's important to handle sensitive issues with care. Harassment claims can be serious, and even if the author didn't intend to harass, the comments were inappropriate. The coworker might feel that the author is belittling her emotional support and the decision to get a therapy dog. The author's sarcastic remarks could be perceived as unkind and not supportive, especially in a work environment where sensitivity is required.\n\nSo, while the author might have had valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed those concerns was unprofessional and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
