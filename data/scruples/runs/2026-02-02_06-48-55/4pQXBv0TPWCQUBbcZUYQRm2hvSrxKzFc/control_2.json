She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for getting a dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and people at work thought getting a dog would help. But the author is upset because the coworker works 11-hour days with a long commute, so the dog would be alone 14 hours a day. The author's comment about giving the dog to someone else was sarcastic and led to being reported to HR. \n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The coworker's intention was to get a therapy dog for emotional support, which is a valid need. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is also legitimate. But the way the author expressed their concern was through sarcasm, which came off as harsh. The coworker felt attacked and reported the author, which might be an overreaction, but the author's method of communication was definitely inappropriate.\n\nThe author should have addressed the issue more constructively, maybe discussing the situation with the coworker privately or suggesting alternatives without sarcasm. Instead, the sarcastic remark was unprofessional and contributed to the conflict. Even if the author's intentions were to help the dog, the delivery was the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not have considered the dog's well-being properly, but the author's response was not the right approach. So, while the coworker's actions might have been misguided, the author's sarcastic comment and the resulting HR issue make them at least partially responsible for the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for handling the situation poorly.\n"
