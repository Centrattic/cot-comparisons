She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author gets annoyed and makes sarcastic comments, which lead to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker is away 14 hours a day. The author's comments were sarcastic, which upset the coworker, leading to an HR report.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the appropriateness of their comments. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid, but the way they expressed it\u2014through sarcasm and comments like \"Netflix instead of a dog\"\u2014could be seen as dismissive and unkind. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the impracticality, the method of communication might have crossed a line.\n\nHowever, the coworker's actions might also be questionable. Getting a dog with such an unmanageable schedule could indeed be problematic, but it's her choice, possibly influenced by her need for emotional support. The author's directness in pointing this out, albeit harshly, might be seen as constructive criticism, albeit poorly delivered.\n\nBut in a workplace setting, even if the author's concern is genuine, making sarcastic remarks about a colleague's emotional support animal could be perceived as harassment or bullying, especially if it's done in a public or professional context. The coworker feeling attacked and reporting it suggests that the workplace environment prioritizes maintaining a respectful atmosphere over the author's personal opinion.\n\nThe author might not be entirely in the wrong for voicing a concern, but the manner and choice of words were inappropriate. The coworker's right to have an emotional support animal exists, but the author's comments could be seen as undermining her mental health support. However, the coworker's responsibility to care for the animal is a separate issue. \n\nIn terms of HR's role, they are likely to side with the coworker because the author's comments were made in a way that could be considered disrespectful, even if the underlying concern was valid. The author's sarcastic remarks might not have been the best approach, hence why they were reported. \n\nSo, considering the balance between the author's concern for the dog and the coworker's mental health support, the author's approach was probably inconsiderate and unprofessional, leading to being labeled as the villain. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because their method of expressing concern was inappropriate, even if the concern itself was valid.\n"
