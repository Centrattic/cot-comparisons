She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker who got a therapy dog, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and not properly trained. The author made sarcastic comments which led to a harassment report.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author mentions. Getting a therapy dog might be a legitimate way for her to cope. But the author is concerned about the dog's welfare since the coworker works long hours. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the dog is left alone for 14 hours a day, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks about giving the dog away or suggesting Netflix instead were met with backlash and a harassment complaint. \n\nFrom a perspective of right and wrong, the author's intention might have been to point out the problem with the dog's living conditions. However, the way they expressed it was sarcastic and possibly dismissive of the coworker's needs. Even if the author had valid concerns, the method of communication might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn a workplace, especially when colleagues have emotional support needs, the approach matters. The author might have thought they were being honest, but the sarcastic tone could be perceived as harsh or insensitive, especially when the coworker is already vulnerable due to her trauma. \n\nHowever, the coworker's action of reporting the comment as harassment raises questions. Therapy animals do require proper care, and if the coworker isn't able to provide it, that's a separate issue. But the author's response, while perhaps not malicious, might not be the right way to address it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely wrong because they raised a concern about animal welfare. But the manner in which they did it was inappropriate. The coworker also has responsibilities as a pet owner, but that doesn't absolve the author of using a sarcastic and potentially hurtful comment.\n\nWorkplace harassment policies often consider the context and intent. Even if the author's comment was meant to be a joke or a critique, if it was perceived as harassment, there's a case against them. But the coworker's history might mean that the comment was more damaging than intended, leading HR to side with her. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author had a valid concern but communicated it poorly, leading to a harassment report. The coworker might have overreacted but has valid reasons due to her personal struggles. The author's sarcasm and the resulting fallout put them in a position where they are seen as the antagonist, even if their intention was to highlight a problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is partially at fault for the way they expressed their concern, even if the concern itself isn't baseless. The correct answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their communication method was inappropriate and led to harassment charges, regardless of intent.\n"
