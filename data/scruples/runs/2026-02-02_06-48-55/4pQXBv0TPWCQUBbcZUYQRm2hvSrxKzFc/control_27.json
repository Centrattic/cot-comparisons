She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about giving the dog away, which led to being reported to HR. The coworker claims the dog is a therapy animal, and others are taking her side. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and is dealing with anxiety, which might make the dog a significant part of her emotional support. The author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid because leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day isn't ideal. However, the author's response was sarcastic and dismissive, which might have been inappropriate even if their intentions were to point out a problem.\n\nThe coworker reported the author to HR, which is a serious consequence. Even if the author had good intentions, using sarcasm and suggesting giving the dog away could be seen as harassment, especially in a workplace setting. The coworker might feel targeted, especially if she's already vulnerable due to her trauma. The author's comments could be perceived as attacking her decision and undermining her emotional support needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's well-being is understandable. However, the way they expressed it was not constructive. Instead of addressing the issue in a supportive manner, they used sarcasm, which escalated the situation. There might have been a better way to approach the coworker privately without publicly criticizing her choices.\n\nAlso, the coworker's response of involving HR suggests that she felt the comments were harmful or disrespectful. Even if others support the author, the act of being reported to HR is a formal step that indicates the coworker took the comments seriously. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their words, especially on someone who is already dealing with trauma.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might think they were being honest, but the method of communication was flawed. It's possible that the coworker didn't realize the dog was being neglected, and the author's comments were meant to highlight that. However, the sarcastic tone and public nature of the comments could have been unhelpful and hurtful.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the actions, the author's concern was valid, but their approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because their method of addressing the issue led to harassment charges, even if their intent was to help.\n"
