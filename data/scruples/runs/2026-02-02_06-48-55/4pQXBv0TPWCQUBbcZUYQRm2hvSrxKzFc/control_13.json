She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend's decision to get a dog. The situation is that the coworker has a long workday and commute, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author expressed sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author's comments were sarcastic and critical, which might be seen as dismissive of the coworker's needs. But the author's concern is about the dog's welfare, as it's left alone so much. \n\nLegally, if the coworker is using the dog as an emotional support animal, there might be protections under the law. The author's comment about giving the dog away could be seen as interfering with that. But the coworker's situation with the dog being in a kennel a lot might not be ideal, raising animal welfare concerns.\n\nSocially, the author might be seen as the one causing conflict by speaking out, even if their intention was to help. The coworker, facing trauma, might be more sensitive, and the author's sarcasm could have come off as harsh. However, the coworker's actions might not be in the best interest of the dog.\n\nHR involvement complicates things. The author's sarcastic remarks could be perceived as harassment, even if they were trying to make a point. The coworker reported them, so the workplace environment is affected. \n\nI need to balance the coworker's emotional needs against the dog's welfare. The author's intention was to highlight an issue, but the delivery was inappropriate. The coworker's well-being is important, but the dog's treatment also matters. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's words were hurtful and unprofessional, leading to HR involvement. However, the underlying concern about the dog's care isn't invalid. The coworker's responsibility to the dog is questionable. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for the way they expressed their concern, but the coworker's actions are also questionable. The question is whether the author's method justifies their actions. Since they were reported and made to look like the villain, but their point about the dog's care is valid, it's a tricky situation. But in terms of being in the wrong for their response, probably yes, because of the sarcastic and hurtful comments leading to harassment charges. However, if the coworker is in the wrong for getting a dog she can't care for, the author's concern is valid but expressed poorly. The answer depends on whether the method of expression is considered wrong. Given that the author's comments led to HR action, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the inappropriate way they addressed the issue, even if their intent was good.\n"
