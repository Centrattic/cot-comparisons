She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who has a dog, and the author is upset about it. The coworker works long hours with a long commute, so the dog is alone for 14 hours a day. The author is annoyed because the dog is in a kennel most of the time, and when the coworker asks for advice, the author makes sarcastic comments. Then the coworker reports the author for harassment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's concern is about the dog's welfare. They think the dog isn't getting proper care because the owner isn't home enough. But how is that their problem? Maybe they overstepped by commenting on it. On the other hand, the coworker is using the dog as an emotional support animal, which is supposed to help with her anxiety. So maybe the author is right to be concerned about the dog's well-being.\n\nBut the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic. Saying \"Give the dog to an owner who can care for it\" and comparing it to Netflix is probably not the best approach. That's unprofessional and could come off as harsh. Even if the author had valid concerns, the method of expressing them was inappropriate. Instead of making snide remarks, they should have approached the situation differently, maybe through private, non-judgmental communication or involving someone else like a supervisor or an animal welfare authority if they were really concerned.\n\nAlso, the coworker was the one who reported the author. If the author's comments were perceived as harassment, even if they had good intentions, the workplace might still hold them accountable for the way they communicated. Workplaces typically have policies against harassment, regardless of the intent. So the author's tone and method of addressing the issue could be the main issue here.\n\nHowever, the author's underlying concern about animal welfare is valid. Maybe the coworker isn't aware of the dog's living conditions or isn't able to provide the necessary care. But it's not the author's responsibility to take matters into their own hands in a public or sarcastic manner. They should have handled it more professionally, perhaps by discussing it with the coworker privately or escalating it through the correct channels without making disparaging comments.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong about the concern, but the way they expressed it was definitely problematic. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they commented, even if their intent was to help.\n"
