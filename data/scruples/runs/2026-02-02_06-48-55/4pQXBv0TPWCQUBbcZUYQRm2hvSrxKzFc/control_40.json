She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a therapy dog, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's care and was reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which makes the therapy dog a significant emotional support for her. The author's concerns about the dog's welfare are valid because leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day might not be ideal. However, the author's approach was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as unkind, even if their intentions were to highlight a problem.\n\nThe key points here are the author's method of expressing their concerns. Instead of approaching the coworker privately and offering constructive feedback, they made sarcastic remarks in a public or semi-public manner. This led to the coworker feeling attacked and reporting the author to HR. The author's comments might be seen as harassment because they were made in a way that could be hurtful and public, even if they were trying to point out a real issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for the dog's well-being is understandable. They might have felt that no one else was speaking up, which is why they did. But the way they communicated their concern was inappropriate. The right approach would have been to discuss it privately and respectfully, maybe suggesting alternatives or support for the coworker to better care for the dog.\n\nThe coworker's side is that the dog is a therapy animal, which is important for her mental health. Even if the dog's living conditions are less than ideal, the emotional support it provides is crucial. The author's comments about the dog's care being inadequate could be seen as undermining her therapeutic needs, especially in front of others.\n\nHR's involvement suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment or unprofessional conduct. The author's sarcastic remarks, even if well-intentioned, crossed a line into unprofessional behavior. The coworker's trauma history adds another layer, making it harder for her to handle criticism, especially from colleagues.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intention might have been to address a genuine problem, but the method was wrong. The coworker has the right to her therapy dog, and the author's public criticism without a constructive approach is where they went wrong. The author should have handled it more sensitively and confidentially. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
