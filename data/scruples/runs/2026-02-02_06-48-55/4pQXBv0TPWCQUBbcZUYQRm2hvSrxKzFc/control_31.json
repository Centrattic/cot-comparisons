She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the dog will be left alone for long hours and not properly cared for. The author made sarcastic comments, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might explain her needing a therapy dog. Her work schedule is long, making it hard to care for a dog. The author is frustrated because the dog isn't getting enough attention and is in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks led to conflict and HR involvement.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong here. The author's intentions might be to point out a problem they see in the situation. However, the way they expressed their concern was sarcastic and potentially hurtful. Even if the author's point has merit, using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation could be seen as insensitive, especially considering the coworker's mental health and the emotional support aspect.\n\nBut there's also the coworker's responsibility to care for the dog. If the author is genuinely concerned about animal welfare, maybe there's a valid point. However, the method of expressing that concern\u2014publicly and sarcastically\u2014could be inappropriate. The author might have a point in questioning the feasibility of the coworker's ability to care for the dog, but the approach led to harassment charges.\n\nAnother angle: the author's comments might be seen as undermining the coworker's emotional needs. The coworker could feel that her mental health support is being dismissed. Even if the author is right about the dog's welfare, the way they communicated their concern could be unprofessional and hurtful.\n\nHR involvement suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment or creating a hostile environment. The author's sarcastic remark about the dog being given to someone else and the Netflix comment might be perceived as mocking the coworker's situation, which could be a valid reason for HR action.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have a valid concern but expressed it poorly. However, the coworker's actions involve her own mental health, which is a personal matter. The author's responsibility is to address their concern in a professional manner rather than through sarcasm.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't entirely wrong in their concern, but their method of expressing it was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the delivery and the impact on the coworker, even if the underlying issue isn't clearly resolved.\n"
