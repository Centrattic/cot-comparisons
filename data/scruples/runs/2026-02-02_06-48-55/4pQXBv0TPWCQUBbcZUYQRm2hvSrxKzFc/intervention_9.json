She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and making sarcastic comments about their coworker getting a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The author's coworker works long hours, so the dog is alone for extended periods, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time.\n\nThe key points here are the author's response. They made a sarcastic comment suggesting giving the dog to someone else, implying that the dog isn't being properly cared for. The coworker took offense and reported the author for harassment. The author feels they were just speaking the truth but in a sarcastic way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the author's comments. Even if the author has a point about the dog's welfare, making a sarcastic and snide remark in a public or work setting can be seen as unprofessional. The coworker might have felt attacked or humiliated, especially since she has a history of trauma and relies on emotional support. The author's comment about Netflix being a better alternative was probably meant to be a joke, but in a work environment, such remarks can escalate tensions and lead to HR involvement.\n\nHowever, the author did raise a valid concern about the dog's living conditions. If the coworker is overwhelmed and the dog isn't being properly cared for, that's a legitimate issue. But the way the author addressed it\u2014through sarcasm and public criticism\u2014might not be the right approach. They should have addressed it privately and constructively, perhaps offering help if possible.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author's intentions might have been to highlight a problem, the method of communication was flawed. The coworker's emotional state and history might make her more sensitive to criticism, so the author's approach could be seen as insensitive, even if the concern is valid. HR likely took the coworker's side because the comment was reported as harassment, which typically involves creating a hostile work environment.\n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong for their delivery but also has a point about the dog's welfare. However, the situation is complex. The main issue is the manner in which the author expressed their concern. The answer hinges on whether the method of communication was appropriate, even if the concern is valid. Since the author used sarcasm and public criticism, leading to HR involvement, they might be in the wrong from a workplace conduct perspective.\n"
