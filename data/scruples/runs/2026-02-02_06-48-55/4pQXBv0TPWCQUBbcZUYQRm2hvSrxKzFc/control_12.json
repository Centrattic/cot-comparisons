She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. So the situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, and the author getting angry about it.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which her colleagues are trying to support with a therapy dog. But the author is concerned because she works long hours and the dog would be alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's care, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the coworker's need for emotional support, the author's valid concerns about the dog's well-being, and the way the author expressed those concerns. The author's comments were sarcastic and maybe harsh, but their concern was about the dog's welfare. However, the coworker felt attacked, and the author's tone might have been inappropriate even if the concern was valid.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have a point about the dog not being properly cared for. On the other hand, the way they expressed it was dismissive and sarcastic, which could be seen as harassment. The coworkers might have a right to protect their employee's mental health, but the author's method of intervention was problematic. The HR issue likely stems from the tone rather than the content. So the author might be in the wrong for the approach, even if the concern was genuine.\n"
