She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The story is that the coworker has anxiety and trauma, and the workplace suggested a therapy dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time, leading to the dog being in a kennel with odor issues. The author made some sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has emotional support needs, and a therapy dog is often recommended for such issues. However, the practicality is questionable here. The coworker's work schedule makes it hard to properly care for the dog. The author's concern seems valid\u2014leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily is not ideal, and the kennel situation might be inhumane. Dogs need social interaction and training, which she's not getting if the owner is away most of the time.\n\nBut the author's approach was sarcastic and dismissive. Comments like suggesting giving the dog to someone else and mocking with \"Netflix\" could be seen as unkind. Even if the author's intent was to highlight the problem, the method of communication was harsh. The coworker feels attacked, leading to HR involvement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is about the dog's welfare. The coworker's actions might neglect the animal's needs, and the author is pointing out a real issue. But using sarcasm and a confrontational approach can be perceived as harassment, especially in the workplace. The author could have raised the issue more constructively, perhaps offering alternatives or discussing the dog's care without being dismissive.\n\nThe coworker's perspective is that the dog is a therapy animal, which is important for her mental health. There's a balance between the coworker's needs and the dog's welfare. The author's intervention might have been necessary, but the approach was flawed.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're concerned about animal welfare, but their method of expressing that concern was inappropriate. Sarcasm and making jokes about the situation in the workplace can come across as bullying or harassment, regardless of intent. The coworker felt targeted, and the workplace took it seriously, leading to the author's report. So, the author's actions, while stemming from a concern, were handled poorly, making them at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n"
