She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker is working long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The coworkers decided to get her a dog as a way to help her. The author objects because the dog would be left alone for 14 hours a day. The author's sarcastic remarks were about the dog's treatment, leading to the HR issue.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the way they expressed their concerns. The author's comments were sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as unprofessional or harsh. Even if the author's concerns were valid, the delivery was inappropriate. Instead of addressing the issue constructively, they used sarcasm, which led to conflict.\n\nAlso, the coworker who got the dog is the one who reported the author. The author's comments were critical of the dog's care, but the coworker might feel that the author is undermining her emotional support animal. The author's suggestion to give the dog to someone else could be seen as insensitive, especially considering the dog's role in the coworker's therapy.\n\nIn a workplace setting, even if someone has valid concerns, the way they communicate those concerns matters a lot. Sarcastic or cutting remarks can damage relationships and create a hostile work environment. HR likely took the coworker's report seriously because the author's comments were presented as harassment. The author might have had a point about the dog's well-being, but the approach was wrong.\n\nSo, while the author might have had valid concerns about animal welfare, the method of expressing those concerns was inappropriate. The answer is probably that the author is in the wrong because their response was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment, even if their underlying concern was valid.\n"
