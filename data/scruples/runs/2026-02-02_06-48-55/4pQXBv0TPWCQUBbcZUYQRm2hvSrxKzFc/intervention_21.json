She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry with their coworker who got a dog. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nSo the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the workplace suggested getting a therapy dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be left alone most of the time. The author then made some sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coworker's circumstances. They have a valid reason for needing emotional support, and a therapy dog can be beneficial. However, the practicality of the situation is questionable. The dog's well-being is a concern if it's left alone for 14 hours a day. The author's comments were sarcastic and maybe not the best way to approach the issue.\n\nBut the coworker didn't ask for the author's opinion directly. The author might have thought they were pointing out a problem, but their tone was harsh and dismissive. Sarcastic remarks in a workplace can be seen as unprofessional and harmful, even if the concern is valid. The coworker might have felt attacked or judged, leading to the report.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not have considered the practical aspects and the dog's well-being. The author's concern could be valid, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. The key here is whether the author's method of expressing their concern was wrong, not the concern itself.\n\nAlso, HR might prioritize how issues are communicated in the workplace. Even if the author's intent was to help, the sarcastic comments crossed a line. So, while the author had a valid concern, the manner in which they expressed it made them look like the wrongdoer in the situation.\n"
