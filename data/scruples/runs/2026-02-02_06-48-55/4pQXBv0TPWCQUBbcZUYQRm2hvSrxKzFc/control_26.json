She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and making sarcastic comments about their coworker getting a dog. \n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker has anxiety and trauma, and her coworkers suggested getting a therapy dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours, so the dog would be alone a lot. The dog isn't getting proper training because she's not home, and the dog is in a kennel most of the time. The author makes a sarcastic comment suggesting someone else take the dog, and then gets reported to HR. \n\nSo, the key points here. Therapy animals are supposed to help their owners, but if the owner can't be home enough to care for the dog, then it's a problem. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being. But their approach was sarcastic and offensive, leading to being reported.\n\nThe coworker is being reported for harassment for making a sarcastic comment. But the underlying issue is that the coworker might be neglecting the dog. However, the author's method of expressing their concern was inappropriate. Instead of addressing it constructively, they made a sarcastic remark which could be seen as cruel or dismissive, especially towards someone with a history of trauma. \n\nEven though the author's concern might be valid (the dog's welfare), the way they expressed it led to a conflict. The coworker might have taken it as an attack on her therapy dog, which is meant to help her. The author didn't approach the coworker privately to express their worries, leading to a public report and HR involvement. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong because they had a concern about animal welfare, but their approach was wrong. They should've addressed it more sensitively and privately. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since their comment led to harassment charges, and they were reported, their method was inappropriate. So, while their intention might have been to help the dog, the way they handled it was wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they had a valid concern. \n\nBut in professional settings, how you communicate is important. Sarcastic comments can be seen as hostile even if they're about a good cause. So, HR would side with the person being criticized, especially if it was reported as harassment. Therefore, the author's approach was unprofessional and wrong.\n"
