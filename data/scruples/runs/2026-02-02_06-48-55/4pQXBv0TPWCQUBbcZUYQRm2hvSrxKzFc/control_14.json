She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker who got a therapy dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being alone for long hours. The author of the post expressed sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and people thought a dog would help. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being because it's left alone so much and not properly trained, leading to a smelly kennel. The author's sarcastic remarks were meant to highlight this issue but were taken as harassment.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions: Sarcastic comments in the workplace can be problematic. Even if the intention was to point out a valid concern, using sarcasm and making snide remarks might not be the appropriate way to address it. The author's comment was reported as harassment, which suggests that the tone and method of communication were offensive to the coworker. However, the coworker's situation is also not ideal for the dog, which raises ethical concerns.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's method of expressing their concern was appropriate. While the issue of the dog's welfare is a valid concern, the way the author communicated it\u2014sarcastically and publicly\u2014could be seen as unprofessional and hurtful. The coworker, who has her own vulnerabilities, might have felt personally attacked, especially if the author's comments were dismissive of her need for emotional support.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's decision to get a dog under her current work schedule might not be the best for the animal. But the author's responsibility is to address concerns constructively, not through sarcasm. The fact that the author was reported and the coworker took it to HR indicates that the workplace dynamics were affected negatively by the author's approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid concern about the dog's living conditions, the manner in which they expressed it was inappropriate. The author should have approached the coworker privately to discuss the issue with empathy and offered constructive solutions rather than making sarcastic remarks. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for the way they handled the situation, even if their underlying concern was justified.\n"
