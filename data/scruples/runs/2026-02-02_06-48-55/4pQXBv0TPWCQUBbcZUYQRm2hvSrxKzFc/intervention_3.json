She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being left alone for long hours. The author gets annoyed and makes sarcastic remarks, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional aspects. The author's coworker has a history of trauma and uses emotional support, which is a valid need. Getting a therapy dog can be a legitimate way to cope, even if the logistics are challenging. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is understandable, but the way they expressed it was through sarcasm and mockery, which crossed into unprofessional territory. \n\nThe key point here is how the author communicated their concerns. Instead of addressing the issue constructively\u2014like discussing the dog's care with the coworker or perhaps talking to management about workplace support\u2014the author made snide comments. This led to the coworker feeling attacked and reporting the author for harassment. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, the method of communication was inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\nAdditionally, the author's sarcasm, such as suggesting Netflix instead of a dog, could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. The coworker might feel that their mental health is being trivialized. The author's comments also didn't offer a solution but instead criticized the situation, which can come off as insensitive.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about animal welfare is valid. The dog being left alone for 14 hours a day is a serious issue. But in a workplace environment, it's important to address such concerns respectfully and through appropriate channels. The author's approach led to conflict and HR involvement, which suggests that their method was wrong, even if their concern was genuine.\n\nIn summary, while the author had a valid concern about the dog's care, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they handled the situation.\n"
