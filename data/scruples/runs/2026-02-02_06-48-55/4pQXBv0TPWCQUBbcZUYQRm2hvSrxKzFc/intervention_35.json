She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who shared the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a therapy dog, but due to her long work hours and commute, the dog is mostly left alone in a kennel. The author expressed their frustration sarcastically, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make the dog important for her emotional support. Legally, therapy animals are often protected under certain laws, so giving the dog up could be a sensitive issue.\n\nThe author's sarcasm and comments about the dog's care and suggesting alternatives like Netflix could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. Even if the author's intentions were to point out the problem, the delivery was sarcastic and potentially hurtful. The coworker reporting the author to HR suggests that the comments crossed a line, especially since they were about a service/therapy animal, which can be a protected activity under anti-discrimination laws in some cases.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. The situation is complex because it's a balance between the coworker's mental health support and the dog's well-being. The author might have a point about the dog's living conditions but handled it poorly.\n\nIn terms of workplace conduct, even if the author's criticism is based on concern, the sarcastic tone and public comments could be seen as harassment. The coworker's right to emotional support might take precedence in a professional environment, and the author's approach may not have been constructive enough. The HR perspective would likely prioritize maintaining a respectful workplace, so the author's comments, while possibly well-intentioned, could be deemed inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering both the emotional support aspect and workplace conduct standards, the author might be in the wrong for the way they expressed their concerns, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
