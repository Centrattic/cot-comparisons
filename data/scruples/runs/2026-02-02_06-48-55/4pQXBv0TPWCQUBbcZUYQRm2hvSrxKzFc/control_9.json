She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their coworker getting a dog despite having a long work schedule, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog was suggested as an emotional support animal. The author is upset that the dog is not being properly cared for because the coworker is away so much. The author's sarcastic comments led to HR involvement.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's tone and method of expressing their concerns. Sarcasm and humor can be risky in professional settings, especially when discussing sensitive topics like someone's mental health and their pets. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the way they were communicated was confrontational and dismissive, which could be seen as unprofessional or even harassing, depending on the workplace's policies.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to voice a concern about the dog's welfare. They might not have realized that their tone was harmful or that the situation is more nuanced. The coworker might feel that her emotional needs are being dismissed, especially if she believes the dog is helping her through a tough time. The author's comment about Netflix is dismissive of her therapeutic needs, which could be perceived as invalidating her experience.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely at fault for having concerns, but the way they expressed them was inappropriate. HR's role is to ensure a respectful workplace, so if the comment was reported and deemed harassing, the author could be in the wrong regardless of their intentions. The coworker's side might dominate because the report was made by her, and the author's sarcastic remarks could be seen as crossing a line, even if they had good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a point about the dog's welfare. However, the method of communication was flawed. Instead of sarcasm, a more constructive approach, like discussing the issue privately and offering alternatives, might have been better. The fact that others support the author suggests there's some validity to the concern, but that doesn't excuse the tone.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, but the delivery was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Therefore, they might be in the wrong in the eyes of HR and the coworker, even if others understand their perspective. The answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the manner in which the concern was raised was inappropriate and led to harassment claims.\n"
