She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a long workday and commute, leading to the dog being left alone a lot. The author expressed their frustration sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which her coworkers considered when getting her a dog as emotional support. The author is annoyed because the dog will be left alone for 14 hours a day, which isn't ideal for a dog. The author's sarcastic comments led to a report to HR.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Legally and ethically, using sarcasm and making jokes about someone's emotional support animal could be seen as insensitive, even if the concern is valid. The author's comments were dismissive of the coworker's needs and the dog's purpose. However, the coworker's situation with the dog being left alone is a valid concern for animal welfare. But the author expressed it in a way that was confrontational and sarcastic, which could be seen as harassment regardless of the underlying issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a point about the dog's well-being, but the way they communicated it was inappropriate. The correct approach would have been to discuss the issue respectfully rather than making sarcastic remarks. The HR report likely came from the coworker feeling attacked or disrespected, which the author's comments might have triggered, even if the concern was genuine.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the method of communication versus the substance of the concern. The author's substance might have a valid point, but the delivery was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they expressed their concerns in a harassing manner rather than a respectful and constructive way.\n"
