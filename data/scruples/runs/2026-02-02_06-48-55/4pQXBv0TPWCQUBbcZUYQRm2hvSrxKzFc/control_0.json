She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: the author gets angry with their coworker who got a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and her ex used to beat her. The coworkers thought a dog would be good for her emotional support. However, the coworker works 11-hour days with a 90-minute commute, so the dog is alone for 14 hours a day, 5 days a week. The author is annoyed because the dog isn't getting proper care or training. The coworker is struggling with the kennel smell, and the author makes sarcastic comments suggesting she give the dog away or use Netflix instead. This leads to the coworker reporting the author to HR for harassment.\n\nHmm. The author's main argument is that the coworker isn't in a position to care for a dog properly, leading to the dog's neglect. They felt it was a good idea to voice their concerns sarcastically. But the coworker took offense, leading to HR involvement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's comments were appropriate. Sarcasm can come off as harsh, even if the intent is to point out a problem. The author's criticism is about the dog's welfare, but the way they delivered it was not constructive. Instead of offering solutions or approaching the coworker respectfully, they made a sarcastic remark. That could be seen as unprofessional or even harassing, especially if it targets someone's personal choices in a sensitive area like emotional support.\n\nAlso, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, so the dog might be a source of comfort for her. The author's comments may have invalidated her feelings or her need for support. Even if the author's concern is valid, the delivery method was poor. In a workplace, how you communicate is as important as the message. Harassment typically involves unwelcome conduct that creates a hostile work environment. If the coworker felt targeted or humiliated by the sarcastic remarks, it's possible HR saw it that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue they were concerned about animal welfare. However, raising such concerns in a public or sarcastic manner, especially in a workplace, isn't the best approach. The right way would be to address it respectfully, maybe through the right channels, like discussing it with the coworker directly or a supervisor if necessary, not through sarcastic comments that could be perceived as attacks.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author's intent was to highlight a problem, the way they expressed it was inappropriate and could be considered unprofessional or harassing. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
