She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog a valid emotional support for her. The author's main issue is that the dog will be alone for long hours, which is a legitimate concern about the dog's welfare. But the way the author expressed their opinion was sarcastic and dismissive, which could come off as harsh or insensitive. \n\nHowever, the coworker herself chose to get the dog, so the author isn't the one who made that decision. The author tried to voice their concern, albeit in a sarcastic manner. But using sarcasm in a workplace setting can be problematic because it's not a respectful way to discuss serious issues. Even if the concern is valid, the tone matters in professional environments. The coworker felt attacked, and that led to HR involvement. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid. The dog being in a kennel for most of the day raises animal welfare issues. But the author's approach was confrontational. Maybe they could have addressed it more constructively, like discussing the situation without sarcasm or suggesting alternatives privately. \n\nThe key points here are: valid concern vs. inappropriate communication. The author's intent might have been to highlight the problem, but the method used was unprofessional. In a workplace, even if you have a valid point, the way you present it can determine the outcome. Sarcasm can be seen as harassment, especially in written communication where tone is harder to convey. \n\nSo, even though the author had a concern, the sarcastic comments led to a hostile work environment, which is why HR got involved. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her emotional support animal, which is important for her mental health. The author's response was unprofessional and contributed to a negative atmosphere. \n\nTherefore, while the author's concern is understandable, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. That makes them at least partially at fault. However, the coworker's decision to report a coworker for expressing a concern, albeit poorly, might also be an issue. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because their communication was unprofessional and contributed to harassment claims, even if their concern was valid.\n"
