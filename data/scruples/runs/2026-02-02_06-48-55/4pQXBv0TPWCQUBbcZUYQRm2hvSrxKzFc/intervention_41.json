She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog, which leads to issues with the dog being left alone most of the time and ending up in a kennel because the coworker works long hours. The author of the story expresses their annoyance sarcastically, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might influence her decision to get a therapy dog. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker isn't home enough to provide proper care. The author's sarcastic comments about the dog being a burden and suggesting giving it up are the main points of contention.\n\nNow, the author's intention was to voice their concerns, but they did so in a sarcastic manner. Sarcasm can come off as dismissive or mocking, which isn't the best way to address someone's actions, even if those actions seem problematic. The coworker, feeling hurt by the comments, reported the author for harassment. The author argues that they were just pointing out the impracticality of the situation, but their method of communication might have been inappropriate.\n\nI should also think about workplace dynamics. Even if the author had valid concerns, using sarcasm and making jokes about a coworker's pet, especially one they consider a therapy animal, can be seen as unprofessional. The coworker might have felt targeted or disrespected. The fact that the author was reported and the company took the coworker's side suggests that the author's approach was not constructive.\n\nHowever, there's a valid concern about the dog's well-being. The coworker's lifestyle might not be suitable for a pet, but addressing this requires a sensitive approach. The author's method of expressing their concern was flawed, but maybe their underlying concern isn't entirely without merit. Still, the way they expressed it led to conflict and professional repercussions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the line between a valid concern and unprofessional behavior can be thin. The author's comments were harsh and sarcastic, which can be hurtful, even if the underlying issue is a real one. So, while the concern about the dog's welfare is valid, the manner in which the author expressed it is problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intentions were to highlight an issue.\n"
