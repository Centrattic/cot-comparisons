She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support. The author is annoyed because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog is left alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to getting reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and an abusive ex, which makes the emotional support dog a valid need. Emotional support animals are recognized for helping with mental health issues. So, the coworker's decision to get a dog isn't just frivolous; it's a coping mechanism.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the dog is left alone too much. But the author's response was sarcastic and confrontational. Instead of approaching the coworker privately or discussing the situation in a constructive way, they made snide remarks. That's probably where the problem lies. Even if the author had a valid concern, their method of expressing it was inappropriate.\n\nThe coworker was asking for advice on training the dog, which shows she's trying. The author's suggestion to give the dog away was probably hurtful, especially since the coworker sees the dog as a therapy animal. The author's comment about Netflix instead of the dog was dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs.\n\nHowever, the coworker reporting the author to HR might have been an overreaction. But the author's sarcastic comments could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harassing, depending on the workplace policies. Even if the author believed they were right, the way they expressed their concern was not the right approach. \n\nIn a workplace, it's important to handle sensitive issues with care and empathy. The author's comments, while perhaps pointing out a real problem, were delivered in a way that's not conducive to a respectful work environment. So, even though there might be some truth to the author's concerns, their actions were unprofessional and contributed to the conflict.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their initial concern was valid.\n"
