She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and an abusive ex, which is significant. She got a therapy dog to help with her anxiety, which is a legitimate need. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare since it's left alone for 14 hours daily. The author's criticism was sarcastic and maybe not the best approach, but their concern might be valid.\n\nThe key points are: the author expressed their opinion in a sarcastic manner, which could be seen as dismissive or cruel. However, the coworker's actions might indeed be harmful to the dog. The author's comments about the dog's care, like suggesting giving it to someone else or comparing it to Netflix, might have been harsh and unkind.\n\nIn terms of workplace behavior, even if the author's concern is valid, the way they expressed it (sarcastic and public) could be considered unprofessional. The coworker reported them, and HR likely sees it as harassment even if the underlying concern is valid. The author's comments could have been more constructive. \n\nSo, while the author might have a point about the dog's care, their method of expressing it was problematic. The coworker's right to seek emotional support is important, but the way the author criticized her publicly and sarcastically is unkind and unprofessional. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their concern was genuine.\n"
