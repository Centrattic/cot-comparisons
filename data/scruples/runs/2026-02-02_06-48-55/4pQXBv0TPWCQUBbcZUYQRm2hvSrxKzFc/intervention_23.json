She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a very demanding work schedule. The author is annoyed because the dog will be left alone for long hours, leading to issues with training and the kennel smelling. They made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They expressed their opinion in a sarcastic manner, which could be seen as unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. Even if their concerns were valid, the way they communicated them might have been inappropriate. The coworker was already vulnerable due to her trauma and anxiety, so the author's comments might have come off as dismissive or harsh.\n\nHowever, the coworker's situation is also questionable. Getting a dog with a 14-hour work schedule might not be feasible. The author's criticism is based on a valid concern\u2014animal welfare\u2014but they didn't address it constructively. Instead of offering solutions or discussing their concerns privately, they made sarcastic remarks in a public or semi-public context, leading to conflict.\n\nHR involvement suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment or unprofessional behavior. The author's sarcastic comments, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as crossing a line. But the coworker's decision to report for such a comment is also debatable, as it's about a disagreement over a pet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The sarcastic comments were unprofessional and hurtful, leading to HR involvement. They didn't handle their concerns appropriately. However, the coworker's decision to report them might be disproportionate. The author's intentions were to voice a legitimate concern but in the wrong manner. Therefore, while the coworker's action might be seen as harsh, the author's communication style was indeed inappropriate. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
