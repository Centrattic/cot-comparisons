She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog. The situation involves the coworker having emotional support needs due to past trauma and anxiety, and she's working long hours with a long commute. The author is upset because the dog will be alone most of the time, leading to issues like kennel smells. The author made sarcastic comments suggesting the dog be given away or suggesting alternatives like Netflix, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The coworker has a valid reason for needing emotional support, and the dog is supposed to help with that. However, the author's concern is about the dog's welfare due to the owner's long hours. The author's response was sarcastic and dismissive, which might not be the best way to approach the issue. \n\nBut the coworker is also responsible for the dog's care. If she can't provide proper care, maybe the dog isn't the right solution. However, the author's method of addressing the problem was confrontational and passive-aggressive, leading to conflict and HR involvement. \n\nThe coworker reported the author, which might be a result of feeling attacked, even if the author's intent was to voice a concern. The author could have approached the situation differently, maybe by discussing concerns privately or suggesting alternatives without sarcasm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author had a valid concern but expressed it in a way that was unprofessional and hurtful. The coworker, while needing support, might not be considering the dog's well-being adequately. However, the author's response crossing into harassment territory is problematic. \n\nSo, while the author's intent might have been to raise a valid point about the dog's care, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not handling the situation more constructively. The coworker is also responsible for the dog's care, but the author's actions led to a hostile work environment issue. Hence, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for the way they expressed their concerns.\n"
