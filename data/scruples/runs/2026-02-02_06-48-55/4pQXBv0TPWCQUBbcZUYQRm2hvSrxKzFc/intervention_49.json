She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for buying a dog, which leads to a conflict and being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the workplace supports her getting a therapy dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being since the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, leading the dog to be alone most of the time. The author expresses sarcasm about the dog being in a kennel and suggests the coworker give it up. This results in the author being reported for harassment.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The coworker's intention was to get a therapy dog for emotional support, which is a legitimate need. The author's concern about the dog's care is valid\u2014long hours and limited time for training could affect the dog's welfare. However, the way the author expressed their concern was through sarcasm and a comment implying the dog shouldn't be with the coworker. This could be seen as unprofessional and harsh, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nEven if the author had a good point, the delivery was inappropriate. Workplace discussions about a colleague's personal choices, even if well-intentioned, should be handled with care to avoid coming across as judgmental. The coworker might have felt targeted or criticized, leading her to report the comment. The author's comment could be perceived as harassment because it undermines the coworker's emotional support animal, which is protected in some contexts. \n\nAdditionally, the author might not have considered alternative ways to address the issue, like discussing it privately with the coworker or suggesting resources for properly caring for a therapy dog. The public and sarcastic remark was a direct attack, which isn't the right approach. \n\nSo, while the author's concern isn't invalid, the manner in which they expressed it was inappropriate and led to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
