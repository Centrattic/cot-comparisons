She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker with emotional support needs who got a dog. The writer is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot, leading to the writer making sarcastic comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to be a therapy animal. The writer is concerned about the dog's well-being, which is valid. However, the way they expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which might not be the best approach.\n\nThe key points here are the writer's intent versus their delivery. They wanted to highlight the problem but used a harsh method. The coworker reported them to HR, which complicates things because even if the writer had valid concerns, the sarcastic comment could be seen as unprofessional or harassing, depending on the workplace's policies.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions that they were the only one to speak up, and others agreed with them but didn't act. That might mean the writer tried to voice their concern, but the method was flawed. However, if the comment was a direct, personal attack, that's different from a constructive criticism.\n\nAnother angle is that the coworker might be using the dog for emotional support even if it's not feasible. The writer's comment about Netflix being a better alternative was probably meant to point out the impracticality but came off as harsh.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the writer's intent was to express concern, but the method crossed a line. Sarcastic remarks can be perceived as harassment, even if the underlying concern is valid. HR's role is to protect the workplace environment, so if the comment was deemed offensive, the writer could be in the wrong despite their intentions.\n\nHowever, the coworker also might be negligent in caring for the dog, but it's not the writer's place to judge or make jokes about it. The appropriate approach would be to discuss the situation privately and respectfully, maybe suggesting alternatives without being sarcastic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer's approach was inconsiderate, even if their concern was valid. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
