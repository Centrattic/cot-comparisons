She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog, and the author (AITA) is upset because the coworker can't properly take care of it due to her long hours. The coworker ends up leaving the dog in a kennel for most of the day, and the author comments sarcastically, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare. The coworker works 11-hour days with a 90-minute commute, so the dog is alone 14 hours a day. That's a lot. Dogs need social interaction, and being caged for that long might not be good for the animal. The author's sarcastic remarks might have been a reaction to frustration, but they came off as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog as emotional support. The author's comment about Netflix instead of a dog could be seen as dismissive of her needs. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight the dog's neglect, the way it was expressed led to HR involvement. The coworker might feel that her emotional support was being attacked.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the coworker reported harassment, the author's sarcastic comments could be considered unprofessional, regardless of the intent. Companies often have policies against negative workplace comments that can create a hostile environment. Even if the author had good intentions, the method of communication was inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about animal welfare is valid. The coworker might not be fit to care for a pet given her work schedule. The author might have thought that the dog's well-being was being compromised. But instead of addressing it constructively, the author chose a sarcastic approach, which escalated the situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the coworker's need for emotional support versus the dog's welfare. The author's sarcastic comments were unprofessional and led to HR involvement. Even if the concern was valid, the way it was expressed made the author look like the antagonist. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the method of communication was inappropriate and unprofessional, even if the underlying concern had merit.\n"
