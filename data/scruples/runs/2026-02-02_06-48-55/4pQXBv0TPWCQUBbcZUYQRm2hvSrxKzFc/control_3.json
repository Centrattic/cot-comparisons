She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a therapy dog despite working long hours, leading the author to express their frustration sarcastically. The coworker then reports the author to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might explain her need for a therapy dog. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare since it's left alone 14 hours a day. The author's sarcastic comments led to a harassment report. \n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. While their concern for the dog's well-being is understandable, the sarcastic remarks in a professional setting could be seen as inappropriate. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, delivering it in a sarcastic and dismissive manner might come across as bullying or unprofessional. \n\nAdditionally, the coworker's mental health needs are significant. The author's comment about Netflix instead of a therapy dog could be perceived as minimizing her legitimate emotional needs. However, the coworker's decision to report to HR might be an overreaction, given that the author was voicing a concern, albeit in a poor manner.\n\nBalancing both sides, the key issue is the method of communication. The author expressed a valid concern but used sarcasm and humor, which isn't constructive in a workplace. Professional environments require respectful communication, even when disagreeing. The coworker's response, while harsh, might be influenced by her vulnerability due to past trauma.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions might not be malicious, but the delivery was inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not addressing the issue professionally. However, there's nuance here. The coworker's mental health is a factor, but the author's method of expression was flawed. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but it's a close call.\n"
