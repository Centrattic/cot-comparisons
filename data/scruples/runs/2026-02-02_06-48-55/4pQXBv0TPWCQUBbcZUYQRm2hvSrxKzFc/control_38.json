She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the coworker got a dog for emotional support, but she's working long hours, so the dog is left alone a lot. The author is annoyed and makes sarcastic comments about the dog's treatment. Now the coworker reported them to HR, and they're being called an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author's coworker might genuinely believe the dog is helping her mental health. The author, on the other hand, is concerned about the dog's well-being, pointing out that it's left alone for 14 hours a day and not properly trained because the owner isn't home. The author's sarcastic remarks were directed at the situation, not the person, but they came off as harsh and potentially offensive.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The coworker's emotional needs, 2) The author's concern for the dog's welfare, and 3) The method the author used to express their concern. \n\nThe author's comments were sarcastic and dismissive, which might have been unprofessional and hurtful. Even if their intention was to highlight the problem, the way they communicated it could be seen as harassment, especially if it's targeted at someone who's vulnerable. In a workplace, making sarcastic remarks about a coworker's pets, especially when it's related to their emotional support, can cross the line. The author's comment about Netflix and the dog dying might be taken as cruel or insensitive, even if the intention was to point out the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might be neglecting the dog's needs, which is a valid concern. However, the right approach would be to address it through appropriate channels, like discussing it with the coworker privately or perhaps with a supervisor, rather than making public sarcastic comments that could be perceived as harassment. The author's approach was probably not the best way to handle it, leading to the HR issue.\n\nSo, considering both sides: while the author had a concern, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong in this situation.\n"
