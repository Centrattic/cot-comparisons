She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make the emotional support dog important for her mental health. The author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid because leaving a pet alone for long hours is not ideal. However, the way the author expressed their concern\u2014through sarcasm and passive-aggressive remarks\u2014could be seen as unprofessional and harsh. \n\nIn a workplace setting, even if someone has good intentions, how they communicate their concerns matters. Telling someone to \"give the dog to an owner who can care for it\" might come across as dismissive and not supportive. The coworker, who is already dealing with emotional issues, might perceive this as undermining her support system, leading to the HR report. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's decision to report the comment for harassment might be an overreaction if the author's intent was to express concern. However, the comment could also be seen as a legitimate expression of worry about the dog's well-being. The key here is whether the author's method of communication was appropriate. Sarcasm in the workplace can easily be misinterpreted and can create a hostile environment, even if the underlying concern is valid.\n\nThe author's actions were brought up to HR, which is a professional forum for addressing workplace issues. The coworker's report likely stems from feeling targeted, especially given her history of trauma. The author might not be in the wrong if the comment was made in good faith, but the delivery and the workplace context suggest that it's a professional misstep. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's intention to express concern is understandable, but the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong due to the unprofessional communication, even if the concern itself is valid.\n"
