She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite working long hours, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The author of the post got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and others thought a therapy dog would help. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone for 14 hours a day. The author's sarcastic remarks about giving the dog away or suggesting alternatives like Netflix led to conflict and an HR report.\n\nOn one hand, the author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid. Leaving a dog alone that long without proper care could be neglectful. The author might have a point in thinking the dog isn't getting enough attention. But on the other hand, the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive. Instead of approaching the issue constructively, they made cutting remarks, which could be seen as harassment, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nThe coworker might have felt attacked, especially since she's already dealing with trauma and anxiety. The author's comments could have been hurtful and unprofessional. Even if the concern was valid, the method of expressing it was inappropriate. The author could have privately talked to the coworker or suggested alternatives without being sarcastic or public about it.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was reported and ended up being seen as the villain despite their intentions suggests that their approach backfired. The workplace environment is sensitive, and public criticism, even if well-intentioned, can create tension and be perceived as harassment.\n\nSo while the underlying concern might have merit, the way the author handled it was flawed. They didn't address the issue in a respectful or constructive manner, which led to the negative outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their response was inappropriate, even if their concern was valid.\n"
