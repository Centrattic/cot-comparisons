She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a coworker with anxiety and a traumatic past got a dog. The author is annoyed because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about giving the dog to someone else and comparing it to Netflix, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a valid reason for needing emotional support, and getting a dog might be a way to help her. The author's concern about the dog's welfare is understandable, but the way they expressed it was sarcastic and dismissive. Comments like suggesting giving the dog away and making a joke about Netflix could be seen as harsh, even if the intention was to point out the problem.\n\nWorkplace etiquette is important. Even if the author's intent was to help, using sarcasm and making jokes about the situation might not be the best approach. It's possible that the coworker felt hurt or that the author was belittling her emotional support needs. The fact that the author got reported to HR suggests that their comments were perceived as harassment, which is a serious workplace issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a point about the dog's living conditions. However, expressing that concern in a respectful and constructive manner would have been better. The author could have suggested alternatives like finding a pet sitter or discussing the situation with the coworker privately instead of making public, sarcastic remarks.\n\nSo, while the author's concern might be valid, the method of expressing it was inappropriate. The coworker's rights to emotional support should be considered, and the author's comments crossed the line into harassment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
