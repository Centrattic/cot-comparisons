She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's coworker, who works long hours and has a traumatic background, got a dog that ends up being left alone most of the time. The author expressed sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a therapy dog seem like a good idea. However, her work schedule makes it hard to care for the dog properly. The author is frustrated because the dog is left in a kennel for long periods, leading to hygiene issues. The author's sarcastic remarks were critical of the dog's care and suggested giving it to someone else, which the coworker took as harassment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author might have a valid concern about the dog's welfare. On the other hand, expressing it in a sarcastic and dismissive way could be seen as unkind and not the appropriate way to address the issue. Also, the coworker's mental health is a factor here; she might be using the dog as a source of comfort, even if it's not ideal. The author's approach was direct but potentially harsh, and even if the concern is legitimate, the manner in which it was communicated could be problematic. Additionally, the author's comment about Netflix as an alternative could be seen as minimizing the coworker's needs.\n\nHR might see the author's comments as contributing to a hostile work environment, even if the intention was to highlight the problem. There's a balance between raising a concern and doing so in a respectful manner. The coworker's perspective might be that the author is undermining her emotional support animal, which is a sensitive issue. The author could have approached the coworker privately to discuss the situation more compassionately instead of making sarcastic remarks in public. \n\nBut also, the coworker's actions might not be in the dog's best interest, and the author might feel the need to speak up. However, the method of communication was the issue here. So, the author's intention might not be malicious, but the delivery was inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern rather than the concern itself.\n"
