She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a demanding job, leading to the dog being left alone a lot. The author got angry and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were concerned about the dog's welfare, seeing it left 14 hours a day. Their comments, while sarcastic, were trying to point out the issue. But they were reported for harassment, which is a serious accusation. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially with her history of trauma and needing emotional support. The author's tone was sarcastic, which can come off as harsh, even if the intent was to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation needs to be considered. She has a history of trauma and anxiety, so the dog might be a genuine emotional support for her. However, the way the author addressed the issue was probably not the best approach. Instead of a public sarcastic remark, maybe a private, more compassionate conversation would have been better. The author's comment about Netflix was probably not the best way to express their concern, even if they were right about the dog's living conditions.\n\nHR's role is to protect the workplace environment, so the coworker might have felt that the author's comments were hostile. Even if the author's intention was to help, the method of delivering the message was inappropriate. Harassment can include creating a hostile work environment, and sarcasm in that context can be seen as unprofessional. The author should have found a more constructive way to address the issue without making snide remarks, especially in a public setting.\n\nSo, while the author might have had valid concerns about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
