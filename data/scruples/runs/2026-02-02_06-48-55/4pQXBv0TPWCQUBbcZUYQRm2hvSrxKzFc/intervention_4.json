She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset with a friend (who's their coworker) for getting a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to be an emotional support animal. The author is annoyed because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the day. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog being in a kennel and suggesting giving it to someone else. This led to being reported to HR, and the author feels like the villain even though they think the dog is being neglected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The coworker has a legitimate need for emotional support, possibly a therapy dog. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker is away so much. The author's response was sarcastic and dismissive, which might have been inappropriate even if their concern was valid.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a concern about the dog's treatment, which is valid. People can have different opinions on pet care, and sometimes animals are not suitable for someone with a busy schedule. But the way the author expressed their concern was through sarcasm and a joke, which can be seen as harsh or unprofessional, especially in the workplace. Making a comment like suggesting giving the dog away or comparing it to Netflix might come off as insensitive, even if the underlying issue is real.\n\nThe coworker then reported the author for harassment. The author's remarks could be considered unkind or even cruel, especially if they are mocking the coworker's situation. The coworker might feel targeted, especially since she's already dealing with trauma and anxiety. The author's comment about the dog \"pissing itself and dying\" is particularly harsh and could be seen as making light of a serious situation. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might have a point about the dog's welfare. If the dog is left in a kennel for 14 hours a day, that's not ideal. However, the proper way to address that would be to approach the situation with the coworker directly, maybe offer help, or talk to someone in a more constructive manner rather than making sarcastic remarks in a public or professional setting. \n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's method of expressing their concern was appropriate. Workplace harassment typically involves unwelcome behavior that creates a hostile environment. The author's comment, while perhaps well-intentioned, was delivered in a way that's unprofessional and could be seen as attacking the coworker's choices. Even if the author believed the dog was being neglected, using sarcasm and jokes in the workplace isn't the right approach and could be considered rude or harassing. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because of how they expressed their concern, even if their concern itself was somewhat valid. The method and tone were inappropriate and contributed to the conflict.\n"
