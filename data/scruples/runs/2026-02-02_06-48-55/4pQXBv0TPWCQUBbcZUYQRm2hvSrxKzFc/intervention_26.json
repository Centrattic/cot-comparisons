She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker with trauma and anxiety who got a therapy dog, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and in a kennel. The author made sarcastic comments suggesting the dog should be given up, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a legitimate need for emotional support, especially given her history of trauma and abuse. Therapy animals can be beneficial, but the situation here seems problematic because the dog isn't getting proper care due to her long work hours. The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid, but their approach was sarcastic and potentially hurtful.\n\nThe key point is how the author communicated their concerns. Instead of addressing the issue constructively, they used sarcasm and made dismissive remarks. This kind of communication can come across as insensitive, even if the underlying concern is valid. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially since she's already in a vulnerable state. The author's comments could be seen as undermining her efforts to cope with her anxiety and trauma.\n\nAdditionally, the author was reported to HR, which indicates that the workplace took the coworker's complaint seriously. While the author might have had good intentions, the method of expressing those concerns was inappropriate. In a professional setting, it's important to address issues respectfully and through appropriate channels to avoid harassment claims.\n\nThere's also the aspect of empathy. The coworker is going through a tough time, and the author's sarcastic response might have exacerbated her stress rather than offering support. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact of their words led to a negative outcome. \n\nHowever, the author wasn't entirely wrong in their concern about the dog's welfare. It's possible that the coworker's decision to get a dog wasn't well-suited to her lifestyle, and there might be a need for a different form of support. But instead of making a sarcastic comment, the author could have suggested alternatives or offered to help in a more constructive way.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent might have been to highlight a genuine problem, the manner in which they expressed it was unprofessional and hurtful. This makes the author at least partially at fault for contributing to a hostile work environment, even if their underlying concern was valid.\n"
