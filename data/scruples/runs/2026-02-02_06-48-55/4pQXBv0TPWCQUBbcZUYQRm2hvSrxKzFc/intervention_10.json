She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who has a dog, and the author is upset about it. The coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog is alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's treatment, which led to a report to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone so much and is confined to a kennel. The author's comments were sarcastic and maybe hurtful, but their intention was to point out what they see as a problem. However, the way they expressed their concerns might be inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker has a valid reason for needing emotional support, given her history of trauma and anxiety. The dog is supposed to help her through that. The author's comments could be seen as dismissive or invalidating her needs. Even if the author's intentions were to help the dog, their approach might have been unkind and unprofessional, especially at work.\n\nNow, about the HR report. The coworker felt attacked and reported the author. The author's sarcastic remarks, while critical of the situation, might cross the line into harassment if they were targeted at the coworker personally. The author's comment about Netflix instead of the dog could be seen as mocking her for needing emotional support, which is sensitive.\n\nIn the workplace, even if someone's concerns are valid, the way they express them matters. The author should have addressed their concerns more constructively, perhaps by discussing it privately with the coworker or through appropriate channels rather than making sarcastic public comments. The fact that others supported the author suggests there's some validity to their concerns, but public sarcasm and jokes about someone's emotional support animal might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's comments were unprofessional and could be hurtful. Even if they're right about the dog's treatment, the method of expressing their opinion led to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, despite their good intentions.\n"
