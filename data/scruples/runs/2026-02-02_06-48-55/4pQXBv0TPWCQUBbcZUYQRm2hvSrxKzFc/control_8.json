She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's situation, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety. People at work thought getting a therapy dog would help her. But the author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker can't spend enough time with it. The author's sarcastic remarks were about the dog being in a kennel too much and the smell, suggesting giving it to someone else. The coworker took offense and reported the author for harassment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author's comments were sarcastic and could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs. Even if the author had valid concerns about the dog's care, the way they expressed it was unkind and potentially hurtful. Sarcasm isn't a good approach in a workplace setting when addressing someone's personal choices, especially when that person is vulnerable.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's actions might be questionable. Getting a therapy dog requires the ability to care for it properly, which includes time and training. If the coworker can't provide that, maybe the dog isn't the best choice. But the author's method of pointing this out was inappropriate. Instead of making sarcastic comments, they should have approached it more sensitively, perhaps discussing the issue privately or suggesting alternatives without being dismissive.\n\nHR's involvement suggests that the author's comments were perceived as harassment, which in a workplace context is a serious matter. Even if the author's intentions were to help, the delivery was problematic. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her support system, especially given her history of trauma. The author's joke about Netflix instead of the dog could be seen as invalidating her needs.\n\nIn terms of workplace policies, harassment often involves unwelcome conduct that creates a hostile work environment. The author's sarcastic remarks, especially when directed at a colleague's personal decisions and mental health, could contribute to such an environment. Even if others agree with the author's concerns, the method of expression is key here. The author didn't address the issue constructively, leading to conflict.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps stemming from concern, were inappropriate. The way they expressed their concerns crossed into harassment, especially in a professional setting. The coworker's right to emotional support is also a factor, and the author's comments might have added stress to someone already dealing with trauma. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
