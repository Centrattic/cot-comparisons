She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the author's main issue is that the coworker works 11-hour days with a 90-minute commute, making it impossible to properly care for the dog. The author expressed their concerns sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coworker's situation. She has emotional support needs and a traumatic past. Getting a therapy dog might be a legitimate way for her to cope. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone for long hours. But instead of addressing the issue constructively, the author made sarcastic comments. That's the key point here. \n\nEven if the author's concerns are valid about the dog's living conditions, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and sarcastic. Using humor or sarcasm in the workplace can be inappropriate, especially when it's about someone's personal situation. The author's remarks led to harassment claims, which is serious. \n\nThe coworkers might have felt that the author was undermining the coworker's emotional support needs. Even if the author thought they were speaking the truth, the method was wrong. The HR involvement shows that the workplace environment is a factor here. The author could have approached the situation differently, maybe by discussing concerns privately instead of making public, sarcastic remarks.\n\nSo, while the author's concerns might be valid, the way they handled it was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
