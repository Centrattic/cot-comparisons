She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a coworker who got upset when a friend (who works with them) got a dog. The friend has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the coworkers thought a dog would help. But the author is annoyed because the friend works 11-hour days with a 90-minute commute, so the dog is alone for 14 hours a day. The author points out that the dog can't be properly trained because she's never home, and ends up in a kennel most of the time. Then the author makes sarcastic comments when the friend is upset about the kennel smell, suggesting giving the dog to someone else. The friend reports the author to HR, and the author feels like a villain but people are starting to support them.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's comments and whether they were appropriate. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, which is valid. But the way they expressed it was sarcastic and possibly harsh. The friend is in a vulnerable position (trauma, anxiety), and the author's remarks could be seen as dismissive of her needs. Even if the author's intention was to highlight the problem, the sarcastic tone might have been inappropriate, especially in a workplace setting. The friend might feel criticized for her choice, which is a personal decision made for therapeutic reasons. The author's comment about Netflix is also a bit flippant, suggesting that the friend's emotional needs could be trivialized. \n\nHowever, the author wasn't intentionally being malicious; they were concerned about the dog's well-being. The friend's decision might not be in the dog's best interest, so the author's concern is understandable. But in the workplace, even if the concern is valid, the way it's communicated matters. Sarcastic and public criticism can be seen as unprofessional and harassing, especially if it's directed at someone's personal choices.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a genuine concern, but the method of expressing it was problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on the situation. The author's comments led to a harassment report, which suggests that the company saw it as inappropriate. Even if others later supported the author, the act of reporting to HR indicates that the comment crossed a line. So, while the author's concern might be valid, the way they handled it was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
