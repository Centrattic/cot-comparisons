She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a therapy dog. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, which means the dog is alone most of the time. The author comments sarcastically that the dog should be given to someone who can care for it, leading to a report to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The company supported her getting the dog as part of emotional support. The author's main issue is that the dog is being left alone too much and the kennel smells. The author's response was sarcastic but perhaps not intended to be malicious. However, they were reported for harassment.\n\nNow, the key points are whether the author's comments were appropriate. Sarcasm can be seen as dismissive or hurtful, even if the concern is valid. The author might have thought they were being helpful by pointing out the problem, but the way they expressed it was harsh. The coworker might have felt attacked or disrespected, leading her to report the comment. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that others were behind them in the company, but the coworker turned against them. HR's role is to handle such reports, and the author's sarcastic remark could be seen as unprofessional or harassing, regardless of intent. \n\nHowever, the underlying issue is valid: the dog's welfare. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being but expressed it poorly. The question is whether the expression crossed the line into harassment. Even if the author's intent was to help, the method of delivery was inappropriate. \n\nSo, while the author's concern is understandable, the way they communicated it was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they expressed their concern, even if their intention was to help.\n"
