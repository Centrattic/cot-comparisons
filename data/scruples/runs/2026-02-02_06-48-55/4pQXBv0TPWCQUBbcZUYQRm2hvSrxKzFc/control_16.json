She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. Getting a therapy dog is a common way to help with emotional support. However, the coworker's job requires long hours and a long commute, making it hard to properly care for the dog. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone so much. \n\nThe author's response was sarcastic, suggesting giving the dog to someone else. The coworker took offense and reported the author for harassment. The key here is whether the author's comments crossed the line into harassment or if they were a valid concern about the dog's well-being.\n\nIn a workplace setting, even if someone's comments are intended to be humorous or sarcastic, they can be perceived as harassment if they offend or upset a colleague. The author's comments might be seen as targeting the coworker's decision and possibly mocking the use of a therapy animal for emotional support. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. \n\nBut when it comes to workplace behavior, it's important to communicate concerns appropriately. Instead of making sarcastic remarks, the author might have raised the issue in a constructive way. However, the coworker's reaction and the report to HR suggest that the comments were not well-received and could be considered unprofessional or even harassing, regardless of the intent.\n\nAnother angle is the coworker's responsibility as a pet owner. If she can't properly care for the dog due to her work schedule, maybe she shouldn't have gotten the dog. But the author isn't in a position to judge or make that decision for her. The author's role is to express concerns, but in a respectful manner.\n\nIn terms of legal and HR policies, harassment can include comments that create a hostile work environment. The author's sarcastic remarks about the dog and suggesting giving it away might be seen as contributing to a hostile environment, especially if they were made in a public or professional context. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern.\n\nHowever, the coworker might have overreacted. The author's intent was to highlight the dog's poor living conditions, but the method was inappropriate. The correct approach might have been to discuss the issue privately with the coworker or involve a supervisor if necessary, rather than making sarcastic comments in a public setting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid concern about the dog's welfare, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and could be considered harassment, making them at least partially responsible for the situation.\n"
