She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a long work schedule, and the author expressed their disapproval sarcastically, leading to an HR report.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which her colleagues wanted to help by getting her a therapy dog. However, the author thinks the dog isn't getting proper care because she's working long hours. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to conflict and being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's intent versus the impact of their words. They were concerned about the dog's welfare but communicated it in a sarcastic and dismissive manner. Even if their concern was valid, the way they expressed it was unproductive and disrespectful. Sarcastic remarks can come off as harsh and insensitive, especially in a professional setting. \n\nThe coworker might have felt attacked, even if the author's intention was to highlight the issue. In a workplace, it's important to address concerns constructively. The author could have approached the situation differently, like discussing the matter privately and suggesting alternatives instead of making public sarcastic comments. \n\nMoreover, the coworker might be using the dog as emotional support, which is a valid need, especially given her history. The author's comments dismissed her emotional needs, which could be seen as invalidating her experiences. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is understandable. However, the method of expressing that concern was inappropriate. The workplace environment requires professionalism, and sarcastic or backhanded comments can damage relationships and lead to misunderstandings. \n\nIn terms of accountability, even though the coworker's actions (getting a dog with a long work schedule) might have issues, the author's response was not constructive. The author could have raised the issue in a more supportive and collaborative way, rather than through sarcasm and public criticism. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention was to express concern about animal welfare, but the execution was flawed. The sarcastic comments contributed to a hostile work environment and led to HR involvement. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong for the manner in which they addressed the issue, even if the underlying concern had merit.\n"
