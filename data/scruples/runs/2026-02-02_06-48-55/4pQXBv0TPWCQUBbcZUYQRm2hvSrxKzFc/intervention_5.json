She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset about how the dog is being treated. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a valid need for emotional support, given her history of trauma and abuse. Emotional support animals are recognized, so there's some legitimacy to her getting a dog. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is also valid. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day isn't ideal. But instead of addressing the issue constructively, the author made sarcastic remarks. \n\nSarcasm and passive-aggressive comments in a workplace can be problematic. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight the problem, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and could be seen as harassment. The coworker felt attacked, leading her to report the author. The author's comments about the dog's care and suggesting giving it away, while maybe a point, were delivered in a way that's not appropriate for a professional setting. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation is complex. She might not have the time to properly care for the dog, but the author could have approached the issue differently. Maybe suggesting alternatives like finding a dog walker or talking to a professional trainer. But the author's method of using sarcasm and making snide remarks contributed to the conflict and led to HR involvement. \n\nIn the workplace, it's important to handle such situations with care and professionalism. Even if someone believes their criticism is valid, the manner in which it's delivered matters. The author's comments, while highlighting a real issue, were inappropriate and led to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their approach was unprofessional and contributed to the problem rather than solving it.\n"
