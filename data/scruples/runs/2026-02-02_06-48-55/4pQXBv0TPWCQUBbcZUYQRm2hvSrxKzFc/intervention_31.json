She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry with a coworker who got a dog. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the author is concerned about the dog being left alone all day.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is the dog's welfare. They think the coworker can't properly care for the dog because of her work hours, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else and the joke about Netflix led to HR involvement. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the coworker has valid reasons for needing emotional support, and getting a therapy dog is a common recommendation. However, the author's approach was confrontational and sarcastic, which might have been inappropriate. While the concern for the dog's welfare is valid, the way the author expressed it\u2014publicly and sarcastically\u2014could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's needs and potentially harassing.\n\nAlso, the HR report was initiated by the coworker, which might indicate that her feelings were hurt. Even if the author's intention was to voice a concern, the method was unprofessional. In a workplace setting, addressing such issues privately and constructively is usually better. The author's comment came off as harsh and unempathetic, which could justify why they were reported. \n\nHowever, there's a balance between being empathetic and being realistic about pet care responsibilities. The author might have a legitimate concern about the dog's well-being, but the way they expressed it crossed a line. So, while the author's concern isn't baseless, their delivery was problematic, leading to the situation being seen as harassment. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for their approach.\n"
