She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a coworker who got a dog despite having a busy schedule. The author is annoyed because the dog is left alone for long hours and ends up in a kennel most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments suggesting giving the dog to someone else, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make having a therapy dog important for her. The author's concern is about the dog's welfare, but their approach was sarcastic and possibly harsh. Even if the author had valid concerns, the way they expressed them led to a conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the author's comments were justified. The coworker is the one who chose to get a dog despite her schedule, so maybe she's responsible. However, the author's sarcastic remarks could be seen as unkind and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. Even if the author believed they were right, using sarcasm and making jokes about the dog's situation might come across as insensitive, especially towards someone with trauma. \n\nAlso, the author was reported to HR, which suggests that their comments were considered inappropriate. The fact that others supported the author but the coworker took it to HR complicates things. However, HR's role is to handle such issues, and the author's comments, while perhaps well-intentioned, might have crossed a line into harassment. \n\nSo, even if the author had valid points about the dog's care, the way they communicated it was problematic. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the tone and approach used. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, given that it led to HR involvement and the author's sarcasm was directed at a vulnerable colleague, it's possible that the author overstepped, even if their concerns were valid.\n"
