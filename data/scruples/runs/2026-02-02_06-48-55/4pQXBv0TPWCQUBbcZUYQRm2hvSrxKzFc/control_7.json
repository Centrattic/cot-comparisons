She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a busy schedule, leading to the dog being alone most of the time. The author expressed their opinion sarcastically, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses emotional support, so getting a therapy dog might be important for her. However, the author's main concern is the dog's welfare because it's left alone too much. The author's sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else might have been a harsh way to express concern, but was the intent wrong?\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, even if the author had valid concerns, using sarcasm and making snide remarks can be seen as unprofessional. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially if the author's tone was dismissive of her emotional needs. The author's comparison to Netflix could come off as minimizing the importance of the therapy dog to her.\n\nAlso, the coworker reported the author for harassment. While the author's intention was to highlight the dog's poor living conditions, the method of communication led to conflict. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed the line into harassment. Even if the concern was valid, the way it was communicated might have been inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\nThe author's right to express concerns exists, but it's important to do so respectfully. The coworker might not have the same perspective on the dog's necessity, especially given her trauma. The author's comments could have been more constructive, perhaps discussing the issue privately rather than making sarcastic remarks in public.\n\nSo, balancing the intent (expressing concern for the dog) against the method (sarcastic public comments) and the impact (being reported for harassment), it seems the author's approach was unprofessional. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their underlying concern had merit.\n"
