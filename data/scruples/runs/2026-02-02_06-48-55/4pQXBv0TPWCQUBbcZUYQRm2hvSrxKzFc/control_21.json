She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and making sarcastic comments about a friend coworker who got a dog. The friend has a history of trauma and anxiety, and people at work thought getting a dog would help. But the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The author's sarcastic remarks led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The coworker has a valid reason for needing emotional support, but the author is concerned about the dog's welfare. The author's comments were sarcastic and maybe not the best approach, but they might have a point about the dog's living conditions. \n\nThe key here is how the author expressed their concern. Sarcasm and comments like \"Netflix won't piss itself and die\" could be seen as harsh and dismissive, especially in a workplace setting. Even if the author had good intentions, the way they communicated it was unprofessional and offensive. That's probably why HR took it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's well-being isn't unfounded. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day is a serious issue. But the author should have approached the coworker privately and respectfully instead of making sarcastic remarks in public or to others. \n\nThe coworker reported the author, which might indicate a power dynamic. The coworker might feel that her emotional support needs are being undermined, especially if others are against the author. But the author's method of expressing concern was inappropriate, leading to harassment charges. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author's concern is valid, the public and sarcastic approach crossed the line. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if their initial concern was justified. The answer should be A.\n"
