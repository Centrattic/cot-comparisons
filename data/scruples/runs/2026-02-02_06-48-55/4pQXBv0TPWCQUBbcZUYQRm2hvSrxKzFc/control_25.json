She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker who has a dog despite working long hours, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. People at work thought getting a dog would help her emotional support. But the author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker's schedule leaves the dog alone for 14 hours a day. The author's sarcastic remarks were about the dog being in a kennel and suggesting giving it to someone else, which got them reported.\n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, leaving a dog alone for such long hours without proper care might be neglectful. The author's concern could be valid, but the way they expressed it was sarcastic and harsh, which could be seen as unprofessional or hurtful. The coworker, who is already vulnerable due to her trauma, might have felt attacked, leading her to report the author to HR.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of the concern, but the approach was inappropriate. However, the coworker's actions (getting a dog she can't properly care for) could also be problematic. The key here is whether the author's response crossed a line into harassment. The coworker reported the author, and HR found it as harassment, which suggests that the workplace saw the author's comments as unprofessional. Even if the author's intent was to highlight a problem, the method was not constructive.\n\nSo, considering that the author used sarcasm and made offensive remarks, even if their concern was valid, they might be in the wrong for the way they communicated. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the approach was inappropriate, even if the underlying concern had merit.\n"
