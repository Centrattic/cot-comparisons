She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite having a long workday, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author expresses frustration and makes sarcastic comments, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and mental health issues, which might influence her decision to get a therapy dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being but expressed their opinion in a sarcastic and dismissive manner, which might have been inappropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily without proper care can be neglectful. The author raised a point about the dog's living conditions, which is a legitimate issue. However, the way they communicated their concern\u2014using sarcasm and suggesting giving the dog away\u2014might have been unprofessional and harsh. \n\nThe coworker's perspective is important too. She's dealing with anxiety and trauma, and the dog is part of her emotional support. The author's comments, while perhaps well-intentioned, came across as mocking her coping mechanism, which could be seen as insensitive. The coworker might feel that her needs were dismissed or belittled, leading her to report the author. \n\nIn a workplace setting, communication style matters. Even if the author's intention was to highlight a problem, the sarcastic tone and dismissive remarks could be perceived as harassment or bullying. The HR involvement suggests that the coworker felt targeted, which the author might not have intended. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author has a valid concern about animal welfare but expressed it in a way that was unprofessional and hurtful. The coworker, on the other hand, might not have considered the dog's well-being adequately, but her mental health needs are also important. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's method of addressing the issue was flawed. While the concern is legitimate, the approach was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they handled it in a way that caused harm and led to a hostile work environment. However, the coworker's decision to report the author for expressing a concern, albeit poorly, might also be questionable. But the question focuses on the author's wrongness. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's sarcasm and the suggestion to give the dog away were unprofessional and contributed to the conflict. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
