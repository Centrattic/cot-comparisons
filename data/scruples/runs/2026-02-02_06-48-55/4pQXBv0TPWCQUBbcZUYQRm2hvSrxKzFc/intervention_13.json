She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their coworker for getting a dog. The coworker works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments and was reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety. Getting a therapy dog could be a legitimate attempt to manage her mental health. However, the dog's welfare is questionable since it's left alone for 14 hours a day. The author's comments, while possibly valid concerns, were sarcastic and came off as harsh. \n\nThe key point here is the method of communication. The author didn't approach the coworker directly or offer support. Instead, they made jokes and were reported for harassment. Even if the underlying concern is valid, the way it was expressed led to conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the coworker might not have considered the dog's needs adequately given her work schedule. But from a workplace perspective, the author's approach was inappropriate. They should have addressed the issue privately, maybe suggested alternatives like dog walking services or discussed the situation with the coworker first.\n\nSo, while the coworker's decision has issues, the author's sarcastic remarks and public comments were unprofessional. This led to HR involvement and being labeled as the villain. The author's intention might have been to highlight a problem, but the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for how they handled it.\n"
