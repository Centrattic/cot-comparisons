She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who complained about their coworker getting a dog is in the wrong. The scenario involves the coworker, who has a history of trauma and anxiety, getting a dog despite working long hours with a long commute. The author is annoyed because the dog is left alone most of the time and isn't getting proper care. The author's sarcastic comment led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, animals are considered property, but there are laws against animal cruelty. If the dog is being neglected, that's a different matter. However, the author's method of addressing it was sarcastic and passive-aggressive, which might not be the best approach. \n\nThe coworker's situation is sensitive. She has emotional support needs, and a therapy dog could be part of her treatment. The author's comment, while perhaps pointing out a valid issue, was done in a way that could be seen as harsh and unkind. The author's sarcastic remark about giving the dog away or suggesting Netflix could come off as dismissive of the coworker's emotional needs and the role of the therapy dog.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily might not be in the dog's best interest. The author could have raised the issue more constructively, perhaps by discussing it privately or suggesting alternatives like a dog walker or daycare. Instead, the author's public, sarcastic comment led to conflict and being reported.\n\nHR's role here is to mediate workplace conflicts. The author's comment, even if well-intentioned, was made in a way that could be perceived as harassment, especially since it was directed at a coworker with known trauma. The coworker felt attacked, which HR would need to address. The author might have breached company policies on respectful communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not have considered the dog's welfare, which is a valid concern. The author's approach was flawed, but the underlying issue is real. The key factor here is the method used to address the problem. The author's sarcastic comment was inappropriate in a professional setting and likely exacerbated the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a legitimate concern about the dog's care, the way they expressed it was unprofessional and led to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for the manner in which they addressed the issue, even if their intent was to highlight a problem. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their approach was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
