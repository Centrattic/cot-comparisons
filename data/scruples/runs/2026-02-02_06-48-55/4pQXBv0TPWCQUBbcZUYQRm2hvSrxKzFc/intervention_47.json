She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog but can't care for it properly due to her long hours. The author expressed sarcastic comments about the situation, which led to a HR report.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, so the dog is meant to provide emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare, which seems valid because the dog is alone for 14 hours a day. But the way the author expressed this concern was through sarcasm and a comment suggesting giving the dog away. That's probably where the problem lies.\n\nEven if the author's intentions were to highlight the issue, using sarcasm and making a snide remark can come off as harsh and unkind. The coworker is already vulnerable due to her trauma, so the author's comments might have been perceived as attacking her rather than the situation. The author was reported for harassment, which is a serious charge, but maybe the company saw the situation as a misunderstanding. However, the author's approach was unprofessional. Instead of addressing the concern constructively, they used a sarcastic comment that could be seen as belittling the coworker's efforts to manage her anxiety with a therapy dog.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's decision to get a dog might not be the best choice given her work schedule. But the author could have approached the coworker privately to express concerns without public criticism. The workplace should be a supportive environment, and if the author had valid concerns, they should have addressed them respectfully. Using humor or sarcasm to make a point can backfire, especially in sensitive situations.\n\nSo, while the author might have had a point about the dog's care, the method of expressing it was inappropriate. That makes me think the author is at least partially at fault. The coworker might have felt attacked, and the author's comments could have been seen as unkind and unsupportive, which is why HR got involved. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong, because the way they expressed their concern was unprofessional and contributed to the conflict.\n"
