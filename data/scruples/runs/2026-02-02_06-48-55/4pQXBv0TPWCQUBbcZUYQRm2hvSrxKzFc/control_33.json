She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a coworker who got a dog as an emotional support animal. The author is upset because they think the coworker can't properly care for the dog due to her long work hours and commute. The author made sarcastic comments suggesting the dog should be given to someone who can care for it, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses an emotional support dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker is away most of the time. However, maybe the author didn't know that the dog is supposed to stay with the owner even when they're away. Emotional support animals might be different from service animals; they don't have the same legal protections but are still used for therapeutic reasons.\n\nThe author's comments were sarcastic, which is unprofessional. Even if the author had valid concerns about the dog's welfare, making sarcastic remarks in the workplace can be seen as harassment. The coworker might take offense, especially if she's already dealing with trauma. The author's approach could have been better\u2014maybe discussing it privately or suggesting alternatives without being dismissive.\n\nBut the coworker reported the author, which might be an overreaction. Emotional support animals are important for some people, and the coworker might feel that the author is undermining her legitimate need for support. However, the author's comments were public and sarcastic, which could be considered unkind and unprofessional regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to address a concern about the dog's welfare, but the method was inappropriate. The coworker's reaction was to report the author, which might be a valid HR concern because of the harassment charge. However, the author's comments were based on genuine concerns. But in a professional setting, even if the concerns are valid, the way they're expressed matters. The author could have approached it more sensitively.\n\nTherefore, while the author might have had concerns about animal welfare, the sarcastic and public comments contributed to a hostile work environment. The coworker's emotional support animal is part of her support system, and criticizing her for that, even if with good intentions, can be seen as invalidating her needs. So the author is in the wrong because their approach was inappropriate and unprofessional, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n"
