She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the coworker got a dog for emotional support, but the author thinks the dog is being mistreated because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone and in a kennel. The author made some sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR. The coworker is the one who reported them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a legitimate need for emotional support, as she's dealing with trauma and anxiety. Having a therapy dog can be a valid part of her treatment plan. However, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is also valid because leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day might not be ideal. But the key here is how the author expressed their concern.\n\nThe author used sarcasm and made jokes, which can be seen as dismissive or hurtful. Even if their intention was to point out a problem, the tone and method of communication might have been inappropriate. Instead of addressing the situation constructively, they made comments that could be perceived as mocking, which led to the coworker feeling attacked. \n\nFrom an HR perspective, they might consider the author's statements as harassment if they created a hostile work environment. Even if the coworker initiated the situation, the way the author responded could still be problematic. The fact that the author was reported and had to explain themselves suggests that their approach was not well-received and possibly violated workplace policies on respectful communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's well-being is understandable. But how to address such issues in the workplace is important. Maybe the author should have discussed their concerns privately and respectfully, perhaps suggesting alternatives like finding someone to help care for the dog, rather than making sarcastic remarks.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention might not be malicious, but the method of expressing their concern was inappropriate. The coworker's emotional support needs are valid, but the author's approach didn't consider the potential impact of their words. The fact that others supported the author might indicate that their concern was shared, but the way it was communicated led to conflict.\n\nSo, while the author had a valid concern, the sarcastic and dismissive comments were not the right way to handle it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they expressed their opinion, even if their concern was justified.\n"
