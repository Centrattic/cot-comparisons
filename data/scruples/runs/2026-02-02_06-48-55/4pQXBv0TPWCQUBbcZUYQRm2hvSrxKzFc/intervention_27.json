She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker who got a dog for emotional support despite having a very busy schedule. The author of the story got angry because the coworker's dog is left alone for long hours and is in a kennel most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were concerned about the dog's well-being, given the coworker's long hours. Their comments were made in a sarcastic tone, which might have been inappropriate. Even if the concern is valid, the way it was expressed could be seen as harsh or unkind. The coworker might have felt criticized, especially if she's already going through a tough time. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation is complicated by her trauma and need for emotional support. Getting a therapy dog is a common recommendation for such cases, even if it's challenging to manage a busy schedule. The author's comments about Netflix instead of a dog might have been insensitive, especially if the coworker relies on the dog for emotional reasons. \n\nLegally, the author might not have done anything that's a violation, but in a workplace setting, making sarcastic remarks about a coworker's personal decisions, even if well-intentioned, can create a hostile environment. HR might see the author's comments as unprofessional, leading to the report. The author's intention was to express concern, but the delivery was problematic. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's approach was flawed. They could have addressed the concern in a more constructive and supportive manner. While their concern for the dog's welfare is understandable, the method of expressing it led to negative consequences. Therefore, the author is at least partially responsible for the conflict that arose.\n"
