She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker who got a dog despite working long hours, leading to the dog being left alone a lot. The author got annoyed and made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They made a sarcastic remark about giving the dog to someone else and compared the dog to Netflix. The coworker then reported the author for harassment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they were just pointing out the obvious problem. The dog's well-being is at risk if it's left alone so much. But the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as unprofessional, especially in a workplace. Even if the concern is valid, the method of expressing it matters. Sarcastic comments can come off as harsh and might not be the best way to address an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not have considered the dog's circumstances properly. The author's frustration is understandable, but instead of making snide remarks, perhaps a more constructive approach would have been better, like discussing the situation with the coworker or involving a supervisor or HR in a respectful way.\n\nWorkplace interactions require professionalism. Even if the author had valid concerns, the sarcastic tone led to conflict and a harassment report. The coworker might feel that the author's comments were attacking her decision, which was personal and possibly based on her emotional needs. The author's comments could be seen as invalidating her emotional support needs, which might be protected under certain policies.\n\nIn some cases, emotional support animals are legitimate, and the coworker might have a right to have one. However, the dog's care is another issue. The author could have raised the concern more constructively. Instead, the sarcastic remarks might have crossed a line, making the author responsible for the hostile work environment, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, considering the method of communication and workplace professionalism, the author's approach was inappropriate. They should have addressed the issue in a respectful and supportive manner rather than using sarcasm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
