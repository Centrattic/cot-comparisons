She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support, but the author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone a lot. The author made a sarcastic comment about giving the dog to someone else, which led to being reported for harassment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The coworker has a history of trauma and an abusive ex, which might make the dog important for her mental health. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being, which is valid, but their approach was sarcastic and dismissive. Saying things like \"Netflix won't piss itself and die\" is pretty harsh and not constructive. Even if the author has a point about the dog's living conditions, the way they expressed it was clearly offensive and contributed to a hostile work environment.\n\nThe author was reported for harassment, and while the HR situation might depend on company policies, the comment was clearly inappropriate. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her emotional needs. The author's frustration is understandable, but instead of addressing the issue directly with the coworker or perhaps suggesting practical solutions, they chose a sarcastic and dismissive approach. That's probably where they went wrong. They should have had a private conversation or maybe suggested alternatives rather than making a public, sarcastic remark that was taken as harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's actions (getting the dog with a busy schedule) might not be ideal, but the author's reaction was unprofessional. The key here is that the author's comment was reported, indicating that it crossed a line in the workplace. Even if they were right about the dog's care, the method of expressing it was wrong. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong, because their approach was unprofessional and led to harassment charges, despite their concerns having some merit.\n"
