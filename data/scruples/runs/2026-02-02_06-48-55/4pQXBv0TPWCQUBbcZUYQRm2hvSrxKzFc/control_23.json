She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker with anxiety and trauma getting a dog, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours and the coworker is struggling with training. The author made sarcastic comments, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The coworker has a history of trauma and an abusive ex, which might make getting a pet a way to cope. The author's concern about the dog's welfare is valid because leaving it alone 14 hours a day is bad for the animal. But the way the author expressed that concern was sarcastic and harsh, leading to being reported.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a legitimate concern about the dog's well-being. On the other, the method of expressing that concern was inappropriate. The author's comments were dismissive and maybe even hurtful, especially since the coworker was already vulnerable. The sarcastic remark about Netflix and the dog dying could be seen as cruel, even if the intent was to highlight the problem.\n\nHR issues usually care about how things are communicated and the impact on others. Even if the author's intention was to help, the delivery was unprofessional and could be considered harassment. The coworker felt attacked, which led to the HR report. So the author's approach was wrong in terms of professional conduct and interpersonal communication.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others are on their side, but in a workplace setting, even if others agree, the way of expressing it matters. The author's sarcastic comments crossed a line, making them at fault for the harassment report. They should have addressed the concern more sensitively, perhaps by discussing it privately with the coworker or suggesting alternatives without being dismissive.\n\nSo, considering the context, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their communication was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n"
