She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that their coworker got a dog, which the author thinks is a bad idea because the coworker works long hours and the dog is left alone most of the time. The author made sarcastic comments about the dog's situation and the coworker reported them to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the dog is supposed to be emotional support. The author's comments, while maybe made in frustration, could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's needs. Even if the author's point about the dog's welfare is valid, the way they expressed it was sarcastic and possibly hurtful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the coworker is the one who went to HR, which might indicate they felt targeted or harassed. The author's statement about giving the dog away could be seen as a solution, but delivered in a way that's unkind. The coworker's reaction might be influenced by their own trauma and the importance of the dog to their mental health.\n\nI should also think about workplace dynamics. Commenting on a colleague's personal choices, especially in a sarcastic manner, can be problematic. Even if the author's intention was to highlight a problem, the method could be inappropriate. However, the coworker's decision to report for harassment might be an overreaction if the author was just voicing an opinion, albeit unkindly.\n\nThere's a balance between expressing concern and respecting someone's choices. The author might have valid concerns about the dog's well-being but should have addressed it differently. The coworker's emotional support animal is a protected right in some contexts, so the author's comments could be seen as undermining that.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern might be valid, the way they communicated it was inappropriate, leading to harassment charges. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
