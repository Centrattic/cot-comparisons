She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after getting reported to HR for making sarcastic comments about their coworker getting a dog.\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the workplace suggested a dog for emotional support. The author is concerned because the coworker works long hours, so the dog would be alone most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks led to being reported for harassment.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the coworker has a legitimate need for emotional support, and the dog was likely meant to help her. The author's comments, while maybe well-intentioned, came off as dismissive and sarcastic. Even if the author's concern was valid (the dog's welfare), the way they expressed it was unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment. \n\nBut wait, the coworker reported the author, and the author ended up being seen as the villain. The coworker might have felt that the comments were undermining her emotional support needs. The workplace's reaction is important here. HR probably sees harassment as any behavior that creates a hostile environment, regardless of intent. So even if the author's point had merit, their approach was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the dog's welfare isn't entirely baseless. However, the way they addressed it was through sarcasm, which isn't constructive. The right approach would have been to discuss the issue directly with the coworker, perhaps suggesting alternatives or offering help with the dog's care, rather than making public, sarcastic comments.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's intent was to voice a concern, but their method was unprofessional and led to harassment charges. Therefore, they're in the wrong for the way they expressed their concern, even if the concern itself was valid.\n"
