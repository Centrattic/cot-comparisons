She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their coworker getting a dog despite working long hours and commuting a lot, leading to the dog being left alone most of the time. The author expresses frustration, makes sarcastic comments, and ends up being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because it's left alone so much. But the author's response was sarcastic and critical, which led to conflict. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the method they used to express their concern. The author was trying to highlight a problem (the dog's well-being) but did so in a sarcastic way that came off as harsh. Even if their concern was valid, the delivery was inappropriate, especially in a workplace setting. \n\nHR's role is to maintain a respectful environment. The coworker felt harassed, and the author's comments were taken as such. Even if others agree the situation is bad, the author's direct comments could be seen as crossing a line. The coworker's emotional support animal status adds another layer; the author's remarks might be perceived as belittling her legitimate need for support.\n\nHowever, the coworker's decision to report for what the author said might be an overreaction. But in a professional context, the way the author communicated their concern matters. Instead of making sarcastic jokes, they should have addressed it more constructively, perhaps in private or through proper channels. \n\nSo, while the author had a valid concern about the dog's welfare, their method of expressing it was unprofessional and led to the conflict. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for not handling the situation appropriately.\n"
