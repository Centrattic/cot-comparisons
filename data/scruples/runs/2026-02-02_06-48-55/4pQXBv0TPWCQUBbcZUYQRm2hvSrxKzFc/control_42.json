She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about getting angry with a coworker for getting a dog, right?\n\nFirst, the coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which is mentioned as her needing emotional support. The person who posted the question is annoyed because she works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be alone for most of the day. That's a valid concern because dogs need companionship and care. But then the coworker isn't able to train the dog, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The poster made sarcastic comments about the situation, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nThe main question is whether the poster is in the wrong. The coworker reported them for harassment, and the poster feels like they were the only one to speak up. But the coworker has allies on their side, so the poster might have come across as harsh, even if their intentions were to point out a problem.\n\nLegally and ethically, making sarcastic remarks that could be seen as offensive or undermining someone's emotional support animal might be problematic. Even if the poster had valid concerns, the way they expressed them was inappropriate. The coworker might feel attacked or disrespected, especially given their history of trauma. The HR situation probably saw it as harassment because the comments were directed at the coworker's emotional support, which is a sensitive area.\n\nHowever, the poster might also have a point about the dog's welfare. But instead of addressing it constructively, they used sarcasm, which is a poor approach. There are better ways to address such issues, like discussing it privately and empathetically. Since the poster's method led to harm and a report, they might be in the wrong despite the valid concern.\n\nSo, considering both the tone of the comments and the context of the coworker's situation, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
