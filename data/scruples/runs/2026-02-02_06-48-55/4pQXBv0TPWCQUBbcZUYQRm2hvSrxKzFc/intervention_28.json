She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and making sarcastic comments about a coworker who got a dog despite a demanding schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The coworkers decided to get her a dog for emotional support. However, the author believes the dog will be left alone for most of the day and not properly trained because of her long hours. The author's sarcastic comments led to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the responsibility of pet ownership and the appropriateness of the author's response. The author's concern is valid\u2014leaving a dog alone for 14 hours daily is not ideal and could lead to issues. However, the way the author expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as insensitive, especially towards someone with trauma and anxiety. \n\nThe author's comment about Netflix was particularly harsh, implying that the dog is dying while away, which might be an exaggeration. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her emotional support needs and the legitimacy of the therapy dog. \n\nHR's role here is to maintain a respectful workplace. Even if the author had a valid concern, the method of expressing it (sarcastic remarks, suggesting giving the dog away) was unprofessional and could be considered harassment. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have been negligent in considering the dog's welfare, but the author's approach was not constructive. Instead of addressing the issue respectfully, the author took a confrontational and mocking tone, which is why they were reported.\n\nSo, while the author's concern might have merit, the way they handled it is problematic. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for the manner of their response, even if their underlying concern is understandable.\n"
