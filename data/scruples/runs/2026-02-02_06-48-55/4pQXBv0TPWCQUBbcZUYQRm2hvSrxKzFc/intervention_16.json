She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddits-style post is in the wrong for getting angry with their friend's decision to get a dog. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has a history of trauma and anxiety, and her coworkers suggested getting a dog for emotional support. The author is annoyed because the friend works long hours and commutes a lot, so the dog would be alone for most of the time. The friend isn't able to properly train the dog, so it ends up in a kennel most of the day. The author made a sarcastic comment about finding another owner, leading to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author's intention was to point out a problem they saw in the friend's situation. However, the way they expressed their concern was sarcastic and dismissive, which could be seen as harsh. The friend is in a vulnerable position, having trauma and needing emotional support. The author's comment, while perhaps meant to highlight a practical issue, came across as cruel and contributed to the friend feeling attacked, leading to HR involvement.\n\nOn one hand, the author had valid concerns about the dog's welfare. On the other hand, the method of expressing those concerns was inappropriate. Instead of addressing the issue constructively, they used sarcasm and a cutting remark, which could be considered harassment or unkind behavior. The fact that the comment caused conflict and led to HR involvement suggests that the author's approach was unprofessional and hurtful, even if their intent was to help.\n\nAlso, considering the dynamics between coworkers, it's important to maintain a respectful environment. Even if the author's intentions were good, the delivery was problematic. It's possible the author should have approached the situation more sensitively, perhaps discussing the friend's responsibilities or offering to help, rather than making a sarcastic comment.\n\nSo, while the author had a point about the dog's living conditions, the way they expressed it was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their method of communication was inappropriate and caused harm.\n"
