She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting angry with a coworker who bought a dog despite a demanding work schedule. The author is annoyed because the dog is left alone too much and the coworker isn't able to properly care for it. The author made sarcastic comments suggesting the dog should be given to someone else and compared it to Netflix, which led to being reported to HR for harassment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses emotional support. The coworkers decided she needed a dog, which might have been a kind gesture. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare. But instead of addressing it privately, the author made public sarcastic remarks. That could be seen as insensitivity, especially since the coworker might be vulnerable.\n\nThe author's comments were harsh and sarcastic, even if their intentions were to point out the problem. Publicly making such remarks could be considered unprofessional and hurtful. HR likely took the report seriously because harassment or unprofessional behavior is a concern in the workplace. Even if the author had valid concerns, the way they expressed it was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation is complicated. She has a legitimate need for emotional support, but getting a dog with such a long schedule might not be practical. However, the author's approach didn't address the issue constructively. Instead of offering help or suggesting alternatives, they made cutting comments that could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's needs.\n\nSo, while the author might have had concerns about the dog's well-being, their method of expressing those concerns was unprofessional and led to conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their intentions were based on concern for the dog.\n"
