She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a coworker who got a dog for emotional support. The author is upset because the coworker works long hours and the dog ends up alone most of the time. The author comments sarcastically about giving the dog to someone else and compares it to Netflix, which led to a report to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and uses the dog for emotional support. Even if the dog's living conditions might not be ideal, the coworker's needs are valid. The author's intention was to point out the problem, but the way they did it was sarcastic and dismissive. \n\nSarcasm can come off as harsh, especially in a workplace. Even if the author's concern is genuine, the method of expressing it matters. The coworker might feel attacked, especially if they're already dealing with anxiety and trauma. The author's comment about Netflix was probably meant to mock the situation, but it's not helpful and could be seen as minimizing the coworker's emotional needs.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about the dog's welfare is also a valid point. Leaving a dog alone for 14 hours a day isn't great, but the author's approach was inappropriate. The right way to handle it would be to approach the coworker privately and offer help or suggest solutions, not make sarcastic remarks in public. Since the comment led to HR involvement, the workplace might see it as harassment even if the author wasn't intending to harm.\n\nSo, the author's intention might be good, but the execution was wrong. They should have addressed it more sensitively. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the method of expressing concern was inappropriate and led to conflict.\n"
