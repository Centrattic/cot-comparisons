She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker getting a dog for emotional support, but the author thinks the dog is being neglected because the coworker works long hours. The author made sarcastic comments that led to a harassment report.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which makes people around her (including the author) think she needs emotional support. The coworkers decided she should get a dog. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being because the coworker is away for 14 hours a day, so the dog is mostly in a kennel. The author made sarcastic remarks, leading to a conflict and an HR report.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the dog isn't being properly cared for. The coworker, on the other hand, sees the dog as a therapy animal helping her through a tough time. The author's response was to make jokes about giving the dog away or suggesting Netflix instead. The coworker took offense and reported the author for harassment.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's concern about animal welfare is valid. However, the way the author expressed this concern\u2014through sarcasm and public comments\u2014might have been inappropriate. Even if the author believed the coworker was neglecting the dog, the sarcastic comments could be seen as disrespectful and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. \n\nThe coworker's perspective is that the dog is a therapy animal, which is supposed to help with her emotional well-being. The author's remarks might have invalidated her needs and attacked her personal choices. Even if the author's intentions were to highlight a problem, the method of communication was harsh and could be perceived as harassment, especially in the context of a coworker with a history of trauma.\n\nHR's involvement suggests that the workplace has policies against harassment and unprofessional behavior. The author's comments, while based on concern, crossed into unprofessional territory by mocking the coworker's situation. The coworker's reaction and the subsequent report indicate that the author's approach was not constructive and instead caused harm to the coworker's feelings and the workplace environment.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were pointing out a real issue. But the key here is how the issue was addressed. Instead of approaching the coworker privately or discussing it with a supervisor in a constructive manner, the author made public, sarcastic remarks, which is not the right way to handle such concerns. \n\nIn many cases, addressing animal welfare concerns should be done through proper channels, especially when it involves a coworker's personal decision. The author's approach might have been unprofessional and contributed to a hostile work environment, which could justify the harassment charge. \n\nOn the other hand, if the dog is indeed being neglected, there might be a valid ethical concern. But in the workplace, such issues should be handled discreetly and professionally, not through public mockery. The author's method of expressing concern was inappropriate, which could make them the antagonist in the eyes of HR and the company, even if their underlying concern was valid.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong because their handling of the situation was unprofessional and contributed to harassment charges, despite having a valid concern about the dog's welfare.\n"
