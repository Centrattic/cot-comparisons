She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at their friend for buying a dog. The situation involves a coworker who got a dog, likely an emotional support animal, but the author is upset because the dog is left alone for long hours due to the coworker's demanding schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. People at work suggested the dog for emotional support. The author is annoyed because the dog will be alone most of the time, leading to poor training and the dog being in a kennel all day. The author made sarcastic comments which led to being reported to HR. The coworker then defended her actions, and now the author feels they're seen as the villain.\n\nLegal and ethical aspects: In many places, emotional support animals are protected under laws like the ADA or FHA. If the coworker has a legitimate need for an ESA, getting one is her right. The author's comments, even if from concern, could be seen as dismissive of her emotional needs. However, the author might argue that the dog isn't being properly cared for, leading to the dog's suffering. But the author's approach was sarcastic and harsh, which might not be the best way to address the issue.\n\nWorkplace dynamics: The author's sarcastic remarks led to a report to HR. This could be seen as harassment if the comments were perceived as targeting the coworker's personal choices, especially related to her mental health. The coworker might feel that the author is undermining her ESA, which is protected. The author didn't approach the concern constructively, which is important in a professional setting.\n\nAnimal welfare: The author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid. Leaving a dog alone for long hours can be harmful. However, instead of making sarcastic comments, the author could have suggested alternatives or discussed their concerns more respectfully. The author's approach might have been inappropriate, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to express concern, but the method used was inappropriate. They should have addressed the issue more constructively rather than using sarcasm. The coworker might have felt attacked, especially if she's already dealing with trauma. The author might be in the wrong for the way they expressed their concern, even if their concern itself isn't entirely baseless. However, the coworker's actions might also have ethical issues regarding the dog's welfare, but that's not the focus here. The main issue is the author's response and its impact in the workplace. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance.\n"
