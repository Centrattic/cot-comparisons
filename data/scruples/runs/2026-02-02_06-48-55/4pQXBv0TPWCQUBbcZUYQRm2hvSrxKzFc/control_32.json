She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker getting a dog despite having a very busy schedule, and the author gets angry and makes sarcastic comments, leading to an HR issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which the author acknowledges. The coworkers decided she needed emotional support, so they got her a dog. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker is away 14 hours a day, leading the dog to be in a kennel most of the time. The author's sarcastic remarks about the dog's situation led to being reported to HR.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the appropriateness of their response. The author was trying to highlight the dog's poor living conditions, but did so in a sarcastic and dismissive way. Their comment about the dog smelling and suggesting it be given to someone else, along with the Netflix comment, might have come off as harsh and unempathetic, even if their concern was valid. The coworker took offense and reported them, which complicates the situation.\n\nIn the workplace, even if someone has a valid concern, the way they express it matters. Sarcastic or cutting remarks can be seen as harassment, especially if they target someone's personal choices or mental health. The author's comments might have been intended to be critical of the situation rather than the coworker personally, but the coworker interpreted it as an attack, and the HR involvement suggests that the workplace found the comment inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about animal welfare is legitimate. The coworker's lifestyle might not be suitable for a dog, which could lead to neglect. The author is in a tough spot between advocating for the dog and handling it professionally.\n\nBut in the context of workplace behavior, the author's method of addressing the issue was unprofessional. Instead of addressing the coworker directly or through appropriate channels, they made sarcastic remarks, which contributed to a hostile work environment. Even if the concern is valid, the delivery led to harassment charges. So the author is in the wrong for the way they expressed their concern, even if their underlying concern is understandable.\n"
