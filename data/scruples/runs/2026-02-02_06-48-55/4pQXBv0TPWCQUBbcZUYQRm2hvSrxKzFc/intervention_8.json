She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker getting a dog, and the author getting angry and making sarcastic comments. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, and the author thinks the dog can't be properly cared for because of her work schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has emotional support needs, and the team suggested getting a dog. The author is concerned about the dog's welfare because the coworker is away so much. The author made a sarcastic comment, which led to being reported to HR.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The person thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know my opinion. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's concern about the dog's well-being is valid. However, the way the author expressed it\u2014sarcasm and suggesting giving the dog away\u2014could come off as harsh and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. Even if the intention was to highlight the problem, the tone and delivery might have been inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's situation is also important. She has a history of trauma, and having a therapy dog might be beneficial for her mental health. But if the dog isn't being properly cared for, that's an animal welfare issue. The coworker might not realize the extent of the problem.\n\nThe author's comments led to being reported for harassment. That's a serious consequence. While the concern was about the dog's welfare, the method used to express it was unprofessional and could have been done more sensitively. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the concern is valid, but the way they addressed it is problematic. \n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, discussing someone's personal choices in a sarcastic manner can create tension. The author should have perhaps addressed the issue more privately and constructively, maybe suggesting alternatives or offering support. Instead, the sarcastic remarks and public comments led to conflict and HR involvement.\n\nSo, while the author had valid worries about the dog's care, the approach was inappropriate, leading to them being seen as the villain. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for how they handled the situation, even if their intentions were to help.\n"
