She\u2019s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here\u2019s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can\u2019t really train it because she\u2019s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she\u2019s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic \u201cGive the dog to an owner who can care for it\u201d. And man did I get attacked. It\u2019s a \u201ctherapy dog\u201d, it\u2019s a \u201cgetting her through a tough time\u201d. My reply was \u201cShe should try Netflix, it won\u2019t piss itself and die while she\u2019s away\u201d. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I\u2019ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I\u2019ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a coworker getting a dog despite not being home often, leading to the dog being in a kennel most of the time. The author of the post gets angry and makes sarcastic comments about the dog's care, which leads to being reported to HR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker has a history of trauma and anxiety, which might make getting a dog a valid emotional support measure. However, the author is concerned about the dog's welfare due to the long hours the owner is away. The author's sarcastic remarks led to HR involvement, and now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal and HR standpoint, even if the author's intentions were to voice a concern, the method of expressing it\u2014sarcasm and a comment about giving the dog away\u2014could be seen as unprofessional or harassing. Workplaces often have policies against such comments, regardless of intent. The fact that the coworker reported the comment suggests it crossed a line, even if others agree with the sentiment.\n\nEthically, the author's concern for the dog's well-being is valid, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. There might be better ways to address the issue, like discussing it privately or suggesting alternatives without sarcasm. The coworker's right to emotional support animals might also play a role here, especially if the dog is considered a therapy animal. However, the main issue is how the author communicated their concern, leading to harassment claims.\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, the author's public sarcastic comment could have invalidated the coworker's needs and triggered a defensive reaction. Even if others support the author's perspective, the method of expression matters in professional environments. HR's role is to maintain a respectful workplace, so they might side with the coworker in this case.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author's intention was to address an ethical concern, but the delivery was unprofessional and led to harassment charges. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they expressed their concern, even if their concern itself is understandable.\n"
