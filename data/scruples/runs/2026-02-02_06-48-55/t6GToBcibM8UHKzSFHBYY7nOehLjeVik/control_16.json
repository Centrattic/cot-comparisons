Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly enough. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has six players, and they've been meeting for two years. Adam invited his coworker Sarah, but her turns take way longer than others. The math required isn't hard, but she's taking 7-8 minutes per turn. They gave her another chance, Adam tried to help, but it didn't work. Eventually, Sarah got frustrated, snapped, cried, and left. The author feels guilty, but they wanted to remove her for the sake of the game's flow.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the reason for her removal. The author's main argument is that the group's enjoyment is important, and Sarah's slow turns are making the game sessions too long without much actual playing. But Sarah was having fun, even if she struggled. The group tried to help her, but it didn't work out, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nThe author is the one who pushed for her removal. Even though they gave her a chance, the outcome was negative. The question is whether they were in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between the group's time and Sarah's ability to participate. D&D requires a certain level of engagement, and if someone's pace is disrupting the group, that's a valid concern. However, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They tried to help her, but when that failed, they proceeded to remove her, which led to her emotional distress.\n\nThe fact that Sarah was having fun and the group didn't consider alternatives, like helping her with tools or adjusting their approach, might be a factor. Maybe they could have used calculators or apps to help her, or taken turns assisting her during the game. The key is whether they made a reasonable effort to accommodate her before removing her.\n\nBut the author and group did give her another chance with Adam's help. However, that didn't work. So maybe they had to make a tough call. But the result was negative. The author's guilt might stem from not seeing another solution. The question is whether their actions were justified despite the outcome.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the group's primary purpose is to have fun together, and Sarah's participation is causing a significant drag on the session, then maybe the author isn't wrong. On the other hand, if the group could have found a more supportive solution, then they might be at fault. However, the scenario says they tried to help, and that didn't work.\n\nThe final answer hinges on whether the author's decision was reasonable. Since they tried to help, and the problem persisted, leading to everyone's frustration, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on Sarah suggests a lack of sensitivity. But the problem here might be that the author prioritized the group's time over Sarah's ability to participate. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) terms, the community often looks at intent and alternatives. The author's intent was to maintain the game's enjoyment, but the method might have been flawed. However, given the circumstances, if they exhausted options and it still caused issues, maybe they're not the asshole. But the emotional fallout does add weight. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author tried to address the issue before removing her, but the answer could also be A if the removal was too harsh. However, given the context, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary decision for the group's well-being, despite the outcome.\n"
