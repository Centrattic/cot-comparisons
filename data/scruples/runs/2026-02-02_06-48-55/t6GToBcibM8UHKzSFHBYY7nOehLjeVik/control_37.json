Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking a really long time to do her turns because she's slow at mental math. The author and the group considered removing her, which happened eventually, leading to her emotional breakdown and leaving the group. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. D&D does involve some math, but it's not super complex. Sarah was invited by Adam, and she's been having trouble with the speed of calculations. The group was frustrated because their sessions were being prolonged. They gave her a chance for Adam to help her improve, but it didn't work, leading to her frustration and eventual departure with tears.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the group's time is important. If someone is significantly slowing down the game to the point where everyone else is losing out on fun, maybe they have a valid concern. But on the other hand, forcing someone out because of a skill they find difficult might be harsh. D&D is supposed to be fun, and if the group's dynamics are suffering, that's a problem.\n\nThe author was the main person pushing for her removal. That's a key point. They felt frustrated, but did they handle it correctly? They tried to give her another chance with Adam's help, but that didn't work. However, the way it ended up making Sarah feel\u2014being pressured, leading to her crying and leaving\u2014suggests that maybe the approach was too harsh. The group might have been more understanding or tried alternative solutions, like using pre-calculated numbers or apps to help with the math. \n\nAlso, the fact that Sarah was having fun even when struggling is a point against the author. Removing her caused her to stop enjoying the game, which is the opposite of the game's intention. The author's priority was the group's time, but they might not have considered enough the impact on Sarah's feelings and whether there were other ways to accommodate her.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the group might have a right to maintain a good experience for everyone. But the way they handled it, leading to her emotional distress, suggests they could have done better. The author's guilt indicates they realized their role in this, which might mean they were too hasty in their decision without fully considering alternatives or the emotional consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they contributed to a situation where Sarah was made to feel inadequate and was removed in a way that hurt her, even if the group's time was a concern. They could have been more accommodating or found other solutions before resorting to removal.\n"
