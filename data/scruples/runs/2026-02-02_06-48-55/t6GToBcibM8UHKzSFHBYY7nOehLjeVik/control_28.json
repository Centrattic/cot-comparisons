Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who asked the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where they kicked out a player, Sarah, because she was too slow with the math. The author was the main one pushing for her removal and now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex. The group had tried giving Sarah a chance, even after she was slow. Adam tried helping her at work, but it didn't work. The problem is that Sarah's slow turns were affecting the game time for everyone else. However, when they decided to remove her, she had an emotional breakdown and stopped playing.\n\nThe key points here are: the group's enjoyment vs. Sarah's enjoyment, the attempt to help her improve, and the outcome where Sarah was upset. The author was the one pushing for removal, which led to Sarah leaving. Even though the group had valid concerns about game time, the way it was handled caused Sarah emotional distress.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They might have thought they were protecting the group's time and fun, but they didn't consider Sarah's feelings adequately. They didn't find alternative solutions, like helping her with tools or taking turns assisting her. Instead, they opted for removal, which caused her to leave upset. The author's frustration led to a decision that hurt someone else.\n\nBut there's also the aspect that the group tried to give her chances. Adam's hesitation due to work dynamics might have added pressure. However, the final action caused emotional harm. The author's guilt now shows they realize this. So, in the context of AITA, the author might be seen as not in the wrong because the group made a decision that was necessary for their dynamic. But Sarah's emotional response complicates it. However, AITA often considers intentions and if the action was reasonable. The author's action was based on group needs, even if it had unintended consequences. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong. But maybe A because they didn't handle it more sensitively. Hmm. I need to check if the author is considered an asshole for causing Sarah to cry. The community might see the group's decision as reasonable but the handling as poor. However, they did try alternatives first. The answer might be B because the author acted with good intentions to preserve the game for everyone, and the outcome was unfortunate but not their fault entirely.\n"
