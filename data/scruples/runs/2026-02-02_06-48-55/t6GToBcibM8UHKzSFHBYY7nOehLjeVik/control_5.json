Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe user is part of a D&D group of six guys. They've been playing for two years. Adam, one of the players, invited his coworker Sarah to join for a few games. Now, the problem is that Sarah is really slow at the math involved in D&D. The user mentions that the math isn't hard\u2014just adding and subtracting single-digit numbers sometimes. But Sarah's turns take 7-8 minutes each because she takes so long to do the calculations. The rest of the group takes 1-2 minutes, and the DM takes 3-4. So, Sarah's slow turns are causing the game to drag, and they're only getting about 90 minutes of actual play in a 3-4 hour session. \n\nInitially, they thought she might be nervous or still learning, but she has all the formulas written down. Adam says she's known for being slow at work too. The group considered removing her, but Adam didn't want it to be awkward at work. They gave her another chance if Adam could help her get faster. Adam tried, but it didn't work. Sarah then became more frustrated and eventually snapped at the group and cried, leading to her leaving the game. Now the user is feeling guilty and asking if they're the asshole (ITA).\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break this down. The user was the main person pushing for Sarah to be removed because of her slow math skills. The group tried a compromise, but it didn't work, leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown. The user is now feeling guilty and questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, consider the impact on the group's enjoyment. D&D is a social activity that requires cooperation and enjoyment for all participants. If one person's participation is causing the game to take too long and making it less fun for everyone else, that's a valid concern. However, the way they handled the situation might be the issue here. \n\nThey tried to give her a chance with Adam's help, but when that didn't work, the group's decision to cut the session short might have been too harsh. The fact that Sarah was having fun initially and even after struggling, but then became frustrated and snapped, shows that the pressure might have been too much. The user admitted to being the most frustrated and the main driver to remove her, which could have contributed to a toxic environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the group's time is also a consideration. Everyone's time is valuable, and if the game is taking up 3-4 hours and only 90 minutes are productive, it's understandable that the group is frustrated. But the method of handling it is key. Instead of removing her abruptly, perhaps there were other solutions, like helping her with the math during the game, allowing her to take notes, or maybe adjusting the game format to be less math-intensive for her. \n\nThe user and the group might have failed to accommodate Sarah's needs rather than blaming her for not being able to do the math quickly. The fact that she was at work with Adam complicates things, as Adam was concerned about workplace relations. The group's decision led to Sarah's emotional distress, which suggests that their approach was not considerate enough of her feelings and her ability to handle the stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user was the main advocate for removing Sarah, so they might bear some responsibility for pushing too hard. However, the group collectively made the decision, so it's not entirely on them. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user's guilt and the outcome (Sarah leaving upset) indicate that their approach had flaws. They might have prioritized the group's time over Sarah's comfort and well-being, which can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's frustration is understandable, the way they handled the situation\u2014pushing for Sarah's removal without finding alternative solutions\u2014might make them at least partially responsible. The answer is likely A (Yes), the author is in the wrong for not accommodating Sarah and contributing to a negative experience.\n"
