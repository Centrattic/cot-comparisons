Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking way too long on her turns because she's slow at mental math. The group was considering removing her, and the author was the main one pushing for it. After a failed attempt to help her improve, Sarah had an emotional breakdown and left the group. The author now feels guilty and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the game's dynamics. D&D does involve a lot of math, and if one player is significantly slower, it can disrupt the flow and enjoyment for everyone else. The group has a limited session time, and if Sarah's turns are taking 7-8 minutes each, that's a problem. The group tried to be accommodating by giving her another chance with Adam's help, but that didn't work. Now Sarah is upset and left, which is the main issue here.\n\nThe author's role was being the primary person wanting her out. Maybe they were impatient and didn't consider other solutions. But the group did try to give her another chance. Then, after Adam's intervention failed, the situation escalated. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting her to leave because of her math speed.\n\nBut math is such a basic part of the game. If you can't do the math quickly, it's hard to keep up. The group might have a right to expect that players can manage the necessary calculations. However, the way they handled it led to Sarah's emotional distress. The author might have been too direct or not empathetic enough. Maybe there were other ways to help her, like using a calculator, having someone assist her, or adjusting the game's pace. But the group tried once, and it didn't work. Now they're facing the consequences of her leaving.\n\nSo the key points: The author wanted to remove Sarah for a legitimate reason (slow play affecting everyone), but the method and outcome caused her to leave upset. The group's actions might have been right in wanting to maintain the game's pace, but the handling was poor, leading to emotional harm. The author's guilt suggests they might feel their approach was harsh. The answer depends on whether the group's actions were justified or if they should have found another solution. But since the game's pace is important for everyone's enjoyment, and they did try to help, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. However, the emotional impact on Sarah is a big factor. In AITA scenarios, causing emotional harm often tips the scale toward being the asshole. So maybe the author is wrong because they contributed to the environment that made Sarah feel pressured and frustrated, leading to her breakdown. Alternatively, if the group's rules require timely participation, then they might be in the right. But the way it was handled, leading to someone crying, is a problem. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their enjoyment over Sarah's well-being without considering alternatives, and their frustration probably contributed to the stressful atmosphere.\n"
