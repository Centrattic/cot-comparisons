Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where they kicked out a player, Sarah, because she was too slow at doing the math required for the game. The poster is wondering if they're an a**hole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: Sarah was invited by a friend, Adam. She takes a long time (7-8 minutes per turn), which is causing the game to drag. The group tried to give her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work. Eventually, Sarah had a breakdown and left.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author was the main person pushing to remove Sarah. The main arguments here would be about fairness and empathy. On one hand, the group's time is being wasted because of the slow pace, which could be frustrating. On the other hand, Sarah was having fun but struggled with something that others found trivial. The group's approach led to her emotional distress, which is a significant negative outcome.\n\nI need to consider if the group handled this correctly. Did they give her enough time to improve? They tried once with Adam's help, but maybe they should have found other solutions first, like helping her more during the game. Also, the math in D&D isn't that hard, but if someone has a learning difficulty or anxiety about it, that's a valid issue. The group might not have been aware of that.\n\nMoreover, their approach of removing her was abrupt and hurtful. Even if they tried to address it, the way they handled it led to Sarah's emotional breakdown. The author's frustration is understandable, but the solution they chose had severe consequences for Sarah. They might not have considered alternatives, like using a calculator or having someone assist her during the game.\n\nSo, the author is not entirely wrong because the group had legitimate concerns about the game's pace. However, they failed to handle the situation sensitively. The key issue is whether excluding someone over a skill they struggle with is justified when it affects their enjoyment. Since the group's actions caused Sarah distress and they didn't explore all possible accommodations, the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
