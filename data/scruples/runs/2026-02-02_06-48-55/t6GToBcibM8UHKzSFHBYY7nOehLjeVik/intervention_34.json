Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she was slow at doing math during the game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has six players who play weekly. Adam introduced his coworker Sarah, who's been part of the group for a few months. The issue is that Sarah's turns take significantly longer than others\u20147-8 minutes each time because she's slow at adding numbers, even though she has formulas written down. The group decided to give her another chance if Adam could help her speed up, but that didn't work. Sarah then became frustrated, snapped, cried, and left. Now the author is feeling guilty and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the author is the one who initially wanted to remove Sarah because of her slow math skills. The key points here are: \n\n1. Sarah was genuinely having fun, as noted by Adam.\n2. Her slowness was causing the game to take too long, but the group had already tried to accommodate her by giving her another chance.\n3. The attempt to help her (Adam's lunchtime sessions) failed, leading to her frustration and emotional breakdown.\n4. The author was the primary push for removal and now feels guilty.\n\nI need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not overly complex. The problem here is Sarah's speed, not her ability. The group tried to help her, but she couldn't improve, and the situation escalated. However, the fact that Sarah was having fun and the removal led to her emotional distress might indicate that the group prioritized their own convenience over her well-being. The author, being the main advocate for removal, might share some blame, even if the group collectively made the decision. But on the other hand, the group had legitimate concerns about the game time and tried to address it. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Did they handle it in a respectful way? Did they consider alternatives? The group gave Sarah multiple chances and even tried to help her improve. However, when Sarah started to show frustration and stress, they still proceeded with the removal, leading to her breakdown. That might indicate a lack of empathy. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome was harmful. So, while the group had valid reasons for wanting the game to run smoothly, their approach might have been insensitive. The author's role in pushing for removal could mean they're at least partially responsible. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted with malicious intent or considered the other person's feelings. Here, the author's intent was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the result was hurtful. The line between being reasonable and being inconsiderate can be thin. Since the group tried to help and Sarah's issue wasn't something that could be fixed quickly, the author's actions might be seen as not the asshole, because they were trying to maintain the group's enjoyment, but perhaps they should have found another solution. However, the emotional impact on Sarah suggests that maybe they weren't entirely in the right. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being the asshole because the group did attempt to accommodate her and the main issue was about game logistics rather than personal attacks. Still, there's a chance the answer is \"Yes\" because they didn't consider enough alternatives. Hmm.\n"
