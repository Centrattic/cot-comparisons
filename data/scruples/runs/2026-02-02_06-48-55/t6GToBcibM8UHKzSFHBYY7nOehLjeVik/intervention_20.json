Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again to understand the details properly.\n\nThe user is part of a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, was introduced. The main issue is that Sarah takes a very long time to do her turns because she's slow at basic math additions. The group was having trouble with the game time being eaten up by her slow turns. They gave her a chance with Adam (who invited her) trying to help, but it didn't work. Eventually, Sarah got frustrated, snapped, and left in tears. The author is the one who pushed for her removal and now feels guilty. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. D&D does involve math, but it's not that complex. The issue is more about the time it takes for each turn. The group had a valid concern because their sessions were getting cut short due to the time spent waiting for Sarah. However, the way they handled it might be problematic. They tried to give her another chance by having Adam help, but when that didn't work, the pressure on her increased, leading to her breakdown.\n\nNow, the author was the main person pushing for her removal. Even though the group's time is important for everyone's enjoyment, they might have made a hasty decision without considering other solutions first. Maybe there were alternatives like using calculators, having someone assist her, or adjusting the game's pacing. Instead, they resorted to removing her, which led to negative emotions.\n\nAlso, the fact that Sarah was having fun despite the struggles is mentioned. The group might have prioritized their own experience over hers, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's frustration is understandable, but perhaps they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy. The outcome was harmful to Sarah, so even if the intention was to improve the game's flow, the method was flawed.\n\nIn social groups, communication and compromise are key. Maybe the group should have discussed the issue more openly with Sarah first, explaining how the time affects everyone and asking if there's a way to help her without making her feel pressured. Instead, they let the situation escalate by giving another chance that didn't work, leading to her emotional distress.\n\nSo, while the author's initial frustration might be relatable, the approach taken could be seen as wrong because they didn't explore other solutions and the result was hurting Sarah's feelings. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the group's actions, driven by the author's push, caused harm without sufficient consideration for alternatives and empathy.\n"
