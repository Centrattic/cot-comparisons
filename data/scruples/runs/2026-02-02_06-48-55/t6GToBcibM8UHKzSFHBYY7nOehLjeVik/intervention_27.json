Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking too long on turns because of her math skills, leading the group to eventually remove her, which resulted in her crying and leaving. The author is the one who pushed for removing her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The group has been playing for two years, adding Sarah via Adam. Sarah's math skills are slow, causing delays. The group tried another approach with Adam to help her, but it didn't work. She ended up frustrated and left in tears. The author is now feeling guilty and asking if they were wrong.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate if that's correct. D&D is a social activity where everyone's enjoyment matters. The group's time is limited (3-4 hours), and Sarah's turns take too long, affecting the overall experience. They gave her a chance with Adam's help, but it didn't resolve the issue. However, the way they went about it led to her emotional distress. \n\nKey factors: Did the group communicate the issue properly? Did they try enough alternatives? Did they consider Sarah's feelings and her enjoyment? The group's primary concern is their own enjoyment, but they might not have considered other solutions. Sarah was having fun, but the math was a barrier. Maybe they could have adapted the game (like pre-rolled dice, using apps for calculations) or given her more support. Removing her abruptly after she was already struggling might be harsh. The author was the main advocate for removing her and now feels guilty. The outcome was negative for Sarah, so the group's actions, while possibly justified in wanting to maintain the game's pace, might have been insensitive.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the balance is between fairness and social responsibility. The group's decision led to a friend's distress, even if the intention was to fix a logistical issue. The author's approach might be seen as prioritizing their own group's experience over Sarah's, without exhausting all alternatives. So yes, the author is in the wrong for not finding a better solution and for the negative impact on Sarah.\n"
