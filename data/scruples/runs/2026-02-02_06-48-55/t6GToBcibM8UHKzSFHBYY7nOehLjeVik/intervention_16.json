Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. They mentioned that the author initially wanted to kick Sarah out because she was slow at math during turns, which caused her to cry and leave. The group tried to give her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve some math, but it's generally simple. If Sarah was taking 7-8 minutes per turn, that's a problem because it affects the entire group's enjoyment. The author was frustrated and pushed for her removal, which led to a negative outcome. \n\nBut then, the group tried to help her by having Adam assist during lunch. Maybe they didn't give her enough time or support. The key point here is whether the author's approach was too harsh or if there were other ways to handle the situation. \n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong. I should check if the author's actions were reasonable. Kicking someone out for being slow at simple math might be unkind, especially if the person is genuinely having fun. The fact that Sarah started to look frustrated and eventually broke down suggests that the pressure might have been too much. \n\nMaybe the author could have offered more in-game assistance or used tools like calculators to help Sarah. D&D can be stressful for new players, but the group's solution might not have addressed her learning style. The author's frustration is valid, but their handling of the situation could have been better. \n\nAlso, after the incident, the author feels guilty, which implies they recognize the negative impact. The question is whether the author's actions were justified despite the outcome. But the way it was handled\u2014prioritizing speed over inclusivity\u2014might have contributed to the problem. \n\nSo, considering the available options, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide adequate support and acted without exploring other solutions.\n"
