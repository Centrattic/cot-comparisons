Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether kicking Sarah out of the group for her math speed was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The group has six players, and Sarah was invited by Adam. She's been struggling with the math part of the game, taking 7-8 minutes per turn, which is way longer than others. The group tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work. Sarah ended up getting frustrated, snapping at people, and crying, then quit.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the group (particularly the author, who was the main push for removing her) was wrong to remove Sarah. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Was the math requirement a necessary part of the game?** D&D does involve math, but it's basic. If Sarah couldn't handle it despite having written formulas, maybe there's a problem. But is it fair to exclude someone for that?\n\n2. **Was the group accommodating enough?** They gave her another chance with Adam's assistance, but that didn't help. However, Adam couldn't magically improve her math speed. Did they try enough alternatives? Maybe someone could have helped her during the game, but the group didn't mention that.\n\n3. **Impact on everyone's experience.** The game is taking too long because of her slow turns. The group is losing enjoyment, which is understandable. But forcing her out led to her emotional breakdown, which is a serious consequence.\n\n4. **Alternative solutions.** Could they have adjusted the game to reduce the math she had to do? Like assigning someone to help her during combat, or using a calculator. The story doesn't mention trying these options, so maybe the group didn't consider them.\n\n5. **Responsibility and communication.** The author was the main one pushing to remove her, which might indicate they were impatient. However, the group collectively decided after discussions. Still, the result was harmful to Sarah.\n\n6. **Intent vs. outcome.** Their intent was to have a fun game, but the outcome was hurting Sarah. Even if their intentions were good, the method might have been wrong.\n\nAlso, Adam's concern about work relationships adds another layer. The group might have been inconsiderate of his professional relationship with Sarah.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the line is often about whether the person's actions were unreasonable given the circumstances. The group had a legitimate grievance with the game's pace, but their solution (removing Sarah) caused significant harm. They could have tried more accommodations before taking such a drastic step. The fact that Sarah was having fun initially and the group didn't explore other solutions (like helping her during the game) suggests they could have been more considerate.\n\nThe author's guilt is also a factor. Feeling guilty after the fact might indicate that kicking someone out over math skills was too harsh. The emotional impact on Sarah, leading to her crying and quitting, shows that the group's approach was not handled sensitively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't explore all possible solutions before deciding to remove Sarah, which led to a negative outcome. The group could have been more accommodating, and the author's frustration might have led to an unfair decision.\n"
