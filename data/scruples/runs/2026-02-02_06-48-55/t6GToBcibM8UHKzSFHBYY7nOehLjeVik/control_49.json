Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone being asked to leave a D&D group because they can't do the math quickly enough. The author was the main person pushing for removing Sarah because her slow turns were causing the game to drag. But after she got upset and cried, he's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the group. D&D requires a lot of back-and-forth, and if one person is significantly slowing down the game, it affects everyone's experience. The group did give Sarah a chance and even let Adam try to help her, but it didn't work. The problem is that while the group members wanted to keep the game fun for everyone, they might not have considered alternative solutions before deciding to remove her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acknowledges that Sarah was having fun, even though she was slow. The way they handled it might have been harsh. Maybe there were other options they didn't explore, like using a calculator, having someone assist her during the game, or adjusting the game's pace. The fact that Sarah got so frustrated and ended up crying suggests that the removal was not handled sensitively. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might have been too direct without considering her feelings and possible accommodations.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. The group might have failed to communicate their concerns in a way that supports Sarah rather than making her feel excluded. Since the game is a social activity, the group's responsibility includes making everyone feel included, even if adjustments are needed. The author's primary role in pushing for her removal, despite her enjoyment, could make them responsible for not finding a middle ground.\n\nSo, while there's a valid reason for wanting to keep the game moving, the method used to address the issue might have been inappropriate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider alternatives and their actions led to Sarah's emotional distress.\n"
