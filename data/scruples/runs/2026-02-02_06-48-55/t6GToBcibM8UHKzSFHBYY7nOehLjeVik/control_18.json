Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for kicking someone out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The group is playing D&D weekly, and Sarah, a coworker of Adam, joined. The main issue is her slow math during turns, which is holding up the game. Others are taking 1-2 minutes, the DM 3-4, but Sarah takes 7-8 minutes. That's a big difference.\n\nThey tried giving her another chance after Adam tried to help her speed up, but it didn't work. Then she got frustrated and had an emotional breakdown. Now she's not playing anymore, and the author feels guilty. The question is whether the author is wrong for initiating her removal.\n\nOn one hand, D&D does require some math, but it's not super complex. Maybe Sarah just needs more practice. The group did try to help, but she couldn't get faster. The author was frustrated and wanted to remove her, which caused her to leave upset. That seems harsh. But on the other hand, the group's time is limited, and the game isn't fun if one person is slowing it down. The author was trying to protect the group's enjoyment, but they might not have handled it sensitively. \n\nThe key points: The author was the main one pushing for removal. They didn't consider other solutions like using calculators or pre-rolling some numbers. The way they handled it made Sarah feel pressured and then upset. The group's intention was to keep the game running smoothly, but they might not have considered Sarah's feelings enough. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, it's about balance between group needs and individual circumstances. The author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's feelings, even after she was already struggling. The fact that she was having fun despite the math issues is a point against the author. Also, the removal led to her breaking down, which shows it was a sensitive issue. So the answer might be A (author is wrong) because they didn't handle it with enough empathy and other solutions weren't explored.\n"
