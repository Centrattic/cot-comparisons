Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group plays D&D weekly, and Sarah, a coworker of Adam's, joined. She's been struggling with the game's math, taking much longer than others\u2014up to 7-8 minutes per turn. The group tried giving her another chance, but even after Adam helped her during work hours, she didn't speed up, leading to frustration and eventually an emotional breakdown where she cried and left.\n\nThe author admits they were the main person pushing for Sarah's removal and now feel guilty. The key points here are the intention behind the action, the method used to address the problem, and the outcome.\n\nOn one hand, the author's frustration with the game time being wasted is understandable. D&D requires participation from all, and if one player's pace hinders the group's enjoyment, it's a valid concern. The group did try to help Sarah, giving her extra time and support, which shows they weren't just immediately hostile. However, the approach of eventually removing her seems harsh. They didn't explore other accommodations, like allowing her to use a calculator or having someone assist her during turns, which might have made the game more inclusive without cutting her off.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. She was enjoying the game, and the pressure from the group led to her distress. The fact that she ended up crying and leaving suggests that the group's actions, while possibly well-intentioned in terms of game efficiency, were hurtful. The author's role in pushing for her removal makes them primarily responsible for the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the group did make an effort to give her a chance and tried to help. They didn't confront her directly but discussed it among themselves first. However, the method of removal, especially without a direct conversation where alternatives could be explored, might have been the wrong approach. The author's frustration leading to a decision that caused emotional harm is a key factor.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's actions, while possibly coming from a place of wanting the game to be enjoyable for everyone, overlooked the importance of Sarah's well-being and the social aspect of the group. They could have been more accommodating or found other solutions. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their approach led to a negative outcome for Sarah, and they didn't fully explore all possible alternatives before deciding to remove her.\n"
