Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking too long to do math during her turns. The poster, who is part of the group, wanted to remove her because of this, and eventually they did, leading to Sarah crying and quitting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the group's primary concern is that Sarah's slow pace is causing the game to drag, but the method they used to address it seems harsh. They gave her a chance with Adam's help, but that didn't work, and then the group's actions led to her emotional breakdown. The poster is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics. D&D is a social activity that relies on everyone's enjoyment. It's understandable that the group wants the game to flow smoothly, but the way they handled it might have been insensitive. They tried to involve Adam to help Sarah improve, but that backfired. Then, when Sarah was struggling and frustrated, the group's actions made her upset. The poster admits feeling guilty now.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that Sarah can't improve. While the poster mentions it's simple math, maybe Sarah has a different learning style or anxiety. The group could have tried more accommodations, like allowing her to use a calculator, pre-written formulas, or even taking turns outside the session to prepare. However, they didn't explore these alternatives and went straight to removing her.\n\nAlso, the group's communication might have been an issue. Instead of threatening removal, maybe a candid conversation about the impact of her pace on the game time could have been more effective. The fact that Sarah was having fun despite the struggles is noted, so removing her might not have been the only solution.\n\nThe poster's role as the main advocate for removing Sarah makes them the central figure here. They might not be in the wrong entirely because they were trying to maintain the group's enjoyment, but their approach lacked empathy and problem-solving. The emotional toll on Sarah suggests that the group, including the poster, didn't handle the situation with enough care.\n\nIn conclusion, while the poster's intentions might have been about group dynamics, the execution was flawed. They didn't consider all possible solutions and the emotional impact on Sarah. Therefore, they might share some responsibility for the outcome. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation sensitively enough.\n"
