Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who started this is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where Sarah, a player, is taking too long with her turns because of math. The author wanted to kick her out, but it ended up making her cry and leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's basic. Sarah has been part of the group for a few months, and even with written formulas, her turns are 7-8 minutes. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam's coworker approach failed. Then Sarah became frustrated and emotional.\n\nThe author was the main one pushing for her removal. After the incident where Sarah left in tears, he feels guilty. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the group had a valid concern about game time being wasted. Sarah's slow pace affected everyone's enjoyment. They tried to accommodate her, like giving her formulas and another chance. But maybe they didn't consider alternative solutions, like a calculator or pre-rolling dice. They should have communicated better instead of pressuring her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's primary motivation was frustration, and he didn't foresee the emotional impact on Sarah. The group's decision led to her distress, which makes the outcome negative. Even though Adam tried to help, the approach didn't work, and the pressure made Sarah's experience worse.\n\nIs the author responsible? Well, he was the main force behind removing Sarah. Even if the group wanted to remove her, the way it was handled was harsh. They didn't try all possible solutions and didn't consider her feelings enough. The fact that Sarah was happy before but became frustrated afterward suggests that the group's actions contributed to her breakdown.\n\nIn social situations like this, communication is key. Maybe they should have talked to Sarah about the pace and offered specific help, not just expecting Adam to fix it. Also, removing a player for something that's not their fault (like math speed) might be unreasonable. So the author's insistence on removing her might be the wrong approach, even if the group was frustrated.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider alternative solutions and the emotional impact, leading to a negative outcome for Sarah.\n"
