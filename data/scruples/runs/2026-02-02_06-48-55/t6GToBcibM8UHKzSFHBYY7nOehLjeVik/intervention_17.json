Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking too long because of math difficulties. The author, who is part of the group, pushed to kick her out, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a fair amount of math, but it's not supposed to be overly complex. Sarah was invited by Adam and has been part of the group for a few months. Her slow pace is causing frustration because the game time is limited. The group tried giving her another chance, but after that, things escalated. Adam tried to help her at work, but it didn't work. Sarah ended up upset and left.\n\nThe author feels guilty now, especially since they were the main one pushing for her removal. They're asking if they're the asshole here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to confirm.\n\nSo, from a D&D community perspective, the game is about fun and social interaction. If someone's participation is causing delays but they're having fun, maybe the group should adapt. Possible alternatives could include using calculators, pre-calculating stats, or having a helper. The author's approach was to remove Sarah, which led to negative consequences. They didn't explore all possible solutions before taking that step. Also, the way they handled it might have been harsh, especially without more support or accommodations for Sarah's learning style.\n\nOn the other hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game time, and if one person's pace is significantly hindering that, there's a valid concern. However, the method of addressing it might have been too abrupt. The author's frustration might be justified, but the execution\u2014leading to her emotional distress\u2014points towards being in the wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author likely didn't handle the situation with enough empathy or problem-solving, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
