Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, the context: the group plays D&D with 6 people. Adam invited his coworker Sarah, and after a few months, they realized her turns take much longer than others. They tried giving her extra help, but it didn't help. Eventually, she got frustrated and left in tears. The author was the main one pushing for her removal.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's see the arguments.\n\nOn one hand, D&D does involve math, but it's basic math. If Sarah can't do it quickly, maybe that was a mismatch. The group had tried helping her, but it didn't work. The author wanted the game to be fun for everyone, and long turns were ruining the experience. Maybe the author felt justified in removing her to protect the group's time and enjoyment.\n\nOn the other hand, the group invited her into the game, knowing she was new. They could have adjusted the game to accommodate her, like allowing using calculators or pre-adding numbers, or having someone assist her. Maybe they should have communicated better instead of just removing her. Also, the fact that she was crying and left in frustration suggests the approach was harsh. The author was the main driver for removal, so maybe they didn't consider alternatives enough.\n\nBut the group did try to help her. Adam even spent time helping her. It didn't work, so maybe they had good intentions. The problem was that the game's pace was suffering. If you play a game that requires quick decisions, and someone can't keep up, it's a problem for everyone else. It's a balance between individual needs and group dynamics.\n\nThe key might be whether they made reasonable accommodations before removing her. If they tried and it still didn't work, maybe it's understandable. But if they didn't explore other options, then they might be at fault. The author's guilt is mentioned, so maybe they feel they could have done better.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were to protect the group's time, but the way it was handled led to Sarah's distress. The author might not be in the wrong if they handled it as a group and tried to help first. But since the outcome was negative, maybe they should have found a different solution. However, the user says the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they tried to help and made a decision for the group's good, even if it had unintended consequences.\n"
