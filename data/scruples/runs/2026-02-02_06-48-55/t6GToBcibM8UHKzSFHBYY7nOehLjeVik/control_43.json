Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking way too long because she can't do the math quickly. The group eventually decides to kick her out, leading to her crying and leaving. The author feels guilty but initially thought she should be removed because of the time it took.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The group's frustration is understandable. D&D sessions have limited time, and if one person is taking 7-8 minutes per turn, it's going to slow down the whole game for everyone else. The author mentions that they even tried giving Sarah another chance after Adam tried to help her, but it didn't work out. The problem here is that the group's enjoyment is being impacted by someone's play style or ability.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was having fun, even if she was struggling. The way they went about removing her might have been harsh. They gave her a chance to improve with Adam's help, but when that didn't work, they ended up making her feel pressured, which led to her emotional breakdown. The author was the main person pushing for her removal, and now he's feeling guilty because it didn't end well.\n\nI should also think about the social dynamics. The group text agreed to remove her except Adam, who was worried about work relationships. Then, when Sarah was struggling more and showed frustration, the group didn't handle it sensitively. Maybe they should have tried different approaches, like pre-calculating some numbers or helping her during the game instead of just kicking her out. \n\nBut then again, D&D requires a certain level of participation. If someone can't keep up, it affects everyone. The author isn't wrong for wanting the game to be efficient and enjoyable for the group. However, the method they used might have been too harsh. They might not have considered all possible solutions before removing her. \n\nThe key point here is whether being unable to perform the necessary math quickly is a valid reason to exclude someone from a game they enjoy. The author's intention was to maintain the game's flow, but the outcome was harmful. The question is whether their actions were justified despite the negative outcome. \n\nI think the answer lies in whether there were other ways to accommodate Sarah. The group tried Adam's help, but maybe they could have tried other strategies, like using pre-rolled stats, simplifying combat calculations, or having a helper during the game. Since they didn't mention trying these alternatives, it might show they didn't put enough effort into finding a solution that works for everyone. \n\nSo, while the author's frustration is valid, the way they handled it might have been the problem. They could have been more empathetic and found another solution instead of resorting to removal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider all alternatives and their actions led to someone being hurt.\n"
