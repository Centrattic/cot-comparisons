Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do the math during her turns. The author, along with the group, decided to kick her out after she couldn't speed up, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author wants the game to be fun and efficient for everyone. D&D can be time-consuming, and if one person is significantly slowing down the game, it's understandable that the group might be frustrated. The author was the main one pushing for Sarah's removal, which shows they felt strongly about it. But then, when Sarah starts to struggle more and gets upset, the group's actions led to her leaving in tears. That's a negative outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was having fun despite the challenges. The group did try to accommodate her by giving her extra time and even suggesting Adam help her. When that didn't work, they decided to remove her, but this caused her emotional distress. The author's role as the primary person advocating for her removal and then feeling guilty afterward suggests a conflict between their initial frustration and the emotional cost.\n\nI should think about social dynamics. Sometimes, people's skills vary, and not everyone can pick up new tasks quickly. The group might not have considered alternative solutions, like letting Sarah use a calculator or pre-calculating some numbers. Maybe there's a way to adjust the game to be more inclusive. The fact that the group didn't try other strategies and instead went straight to removal might be a problem.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. Even if the group's intention was to maintain game flow, the result was her distress. The author's guilt indicates they recognize the harm caused. The question is whether their actions were justified despite the outcome. Since the group's approach led to a negative experience for Sarah, it's likely the author is in the wrong. They prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's well-being and didn't explore all possible solutions before taking such a drastic step.\n"
