Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking way too long on her turns because she's slow at math. The group, after trying to be patient, decided to ask her to leave, which ended up making her cry and leave upset. The author is the one who was most frustrated and pushed for her removal, and now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a D&D game. It's a social activity that relies on everyone participating and enjoying themselves. If one person's pace is dragging down the whole group's experience, that's a problem. But on the other hand, everyone deserves to feel included and not humiliated.\n\nThe group did try to be accommodating initially, giving Sarah time to adjust. They even had Adam help her at work. But it didn't work, and Sarah's frustration led to her emotional breakdown. The key question is whether the group handled it the right way. \n\nThe author's motivation was to preserve the game time and fun for everyone else. But the method they used\u2014removing her without a more supportive approach\u2014might have been harsh. They didn't find another solution, like helping her with tools or adjusting the game style to reduce math stress. For example, maybe using a calculator or pre-rolling dice to save time. \n\nAlso, the way they communicated their problems to Sarah might have been hurtful. Instead of being upfront about the time issue, maybe they could have discussed it more privately and sensitively. The result was Sarah feeling pressured and then getting upset, which reflects poorly on the group's empathy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was the main person pushing for her removal, so their guilt might be higher. However, it's possible that the group didn't consider all alternatives. The fact that they felt guilty afterward suggests that they realize their actions had negative consequences. \n\nSo, balancing the need for the group's enjoyment against Sarah's feelings and inclusion, the group's approach might have been too abrupt and lacking in support. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the way they handled it definitely had flaws. Since the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no), and considering the emotional impact on Sarah, the answer leans towards A.\n"
