Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do the math during her turns, causing frustration. The original poster (OP) was the one pushing to remove her from the group, which led to Sarah having an emotional breakdown and leaving. Now OP feels guilty and is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D involves a lot of math, but it's not supposed to be too complex. Sarah was invited by Adam, who's concerned about work relationships. The group tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out. The result was Sarah getting frustrated and emotional, which OP now feels bad about.\n\nSo, the question is whether OP was in the wrong. On one hand, group activities require consideration for everyone's time and enjoyment. If one person is slowing down the game significantly, it might affect the whole group's experience. But on the other hand, the approach taken here was to kick her out after she was already struggling and becoming upset. It's possible that the group didn't provide adequate support or alternatives, like using a calculator or other tools to help with the math. They might have also considered adjusting the game's pace or the way turns are handled to accommodate her.\n\nThe fact that Sarah was having fun despite the math issues suggests that she was invested in the game. The group's decision to remove her might have been too abrupt, especially without trying more solutions first. Also, the emotional response from Sarah indicates that the situation was handled poorly, and OP's role in pushing for her removal could be seen as insensitive. However, OP might have been trying to preserve the group's time and enjoyment, which is understandable in a group setting where everyone's experience matters.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the approach was considerate. The group should have explored other options before deciding to remove her. Maybe they could have offered more help, adjusted the game's mechanics, or communicated better to find a solution that works for everyone. The fact that they ended up making her cry suggests that the method of removal was harsh, especially since Adam was concerned about the work relationship. OP's guilt after the fact also points to recognizing that their actions had negative consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while OP's frustration might be valid, the way they handled the situation\u2014by insisting on removing Sarah without trying other solutions\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The emotional impact on Sarah indicates that the approach was too abrupt and not empathetic enough. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
