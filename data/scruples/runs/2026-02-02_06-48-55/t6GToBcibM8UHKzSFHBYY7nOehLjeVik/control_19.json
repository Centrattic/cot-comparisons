Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the D&D group is in the wrong for kicking out a player because she can't do math quickly enough. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points from the story. The group plays D&D weekly, and Sarah, a new player invited by Adam, is taking much longer than others during her turns. The math required isn't complex, but Sarah's slow pace is causing the game to take too long. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam helped her at work, but that didn't work, leading to Sarah getting upset and leaving in tears. The author is now feeling guilty.\n\nThe key factors here are the impact on the group's enjoyment and the handling of the situation. While the author might have been frustrated with the slow game, the way it was handled could have been better. Forcing someone out because of their pace, even if it's affecting the group, might not be fair. They gave her a chance, but the result was emotional distress for Sarah. \n\nAlso, the author was the main person pushing for her removal. Even if the group collectively decided, the author's role in initiating it and their frustration could be a point against them. However, D&D relies on everyone's participation and time. If one person is causing significant delays, the group has a right to address it. The problem is how they addressed it\u2014leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely at fault because the group had a problem that needed solving. But the approach was flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they contributed to a situation that caused someone to leave in tears, it's possible they share some responsibility. So the answer might be A (Yes). Alternatively, maybe it's not entirely their fault because the group had a consensus after Adam's failed attempt to help. Hmm. Need to weigh the intent vs. the outcome. The outcome was harmful, but the intent was to improve the game's flow. But they could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps finding another solution instead of removing her. So the answer is A.\n"
