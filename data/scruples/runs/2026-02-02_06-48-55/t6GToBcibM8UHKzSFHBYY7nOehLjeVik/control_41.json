Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is being kicked out because she's too slow at doing the math required for her turns. The author was the main person pushing for her removal, and it led to Sarah crying and leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex. However, Sarah's slowness is causing significant delays, impacting the group's enjoyment. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam's intervention, but that didn't work, and Sarah ended up frustrated and upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are the group's right to enjoy their game versus Sarah's enjoyment and well-being. The author was frustrated and wanted to maintain the game's pace, which is understandable. But the way they handled it might be the issue. They did try to give her another chance, but maybe they should have considered alternative solutions first, like pre-rolling dice or using apps to help with calculations. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. She was having fun initially but became frustrated and eventually broke down. The group might not have handled the communication well. Maybe they should have talked to her privately before deciding to remove her, explaining the issue and looking for solutions together. Instead, they let the situation escalate to the point of public frustration and then removal, which hurt Sarah's feelings.\n\nThe author's role was primary in pushing for her removal, which adds guilt. They might not have considered that Sarah's math skills aren't the problem but her processing speed or anxiety. There could be a lack of empathy here. While the group has a right to enjoy their time, they also have a responsibility to be inclusive. Maybe there were other accommodations they could have made before resorting to removing her.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on balancing group dynamics with individual circumstances. The author's actions led to a negative outcome for Sarah, so they might be in the wrong for not finding a more compassionate solution first.\n"
