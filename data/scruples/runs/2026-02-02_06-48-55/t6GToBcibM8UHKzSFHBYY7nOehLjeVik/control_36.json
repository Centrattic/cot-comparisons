Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking a really long time on her turns because she's slow at doing the necessary math. The author wanted her to be removed from the group because it was causing the game to drag, but now they feel guilty because Sarah ended up crying and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, D&D relies on everyone's participation, and if one person is significantly slowing things down, it affects the whole group's experience. The author and the group probably felt frustrated, especially since they mentioned losing a lot of time in each session. They tried to address it by giving Sarah another chance with Adam's help, but that didn't work, and Sarah ended up more stressed and upset.\n\nOn the other hand, inviting someone to join a social group comes with the responsibility of making sure they can participate comfortably. The author and the group might not have realized how challenging the math would be for Sarah. While the math isn't complex, for someone who is already slower at it, the pressure of a group setting might be overwhelming. The fact that Sarah was having fun despite her struggles suggests she was making an effort. However, the group's main goal is to enjoy the game together, and Sarah's slow pace disrupted that.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to improve the game experience for the group, which is understandable. But the impact was that Sarah was made to feel excluded and upset. The author might have been acting in the group's best interest, but they didn't consider the personal impact on Sarah. The way they handled the situation\u2014trying to address it by removing her without a more supportive approach\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is that the group could have tried alternative solutions, like using pre-calculated charts, apps, or having someone assist Sarah during her turns. Instead of removing her, they could have made accommodations to help her keep up. The fact that they tried to let Adam help her at work was a step, but maybe not the best approach. The result shows that the method of removing her was harmful.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions led to a negative outcome, even if the intent was to fix the group's problem. The responsibility of a group is to be inclusive and find solutions that work for everyone. Removing a member, especially if they were enjoying the game, without exhausting all possible accommodations might be the wrong approach. The author's role as the primary advocate for removal might make them more accountable for the outcome.\n"
