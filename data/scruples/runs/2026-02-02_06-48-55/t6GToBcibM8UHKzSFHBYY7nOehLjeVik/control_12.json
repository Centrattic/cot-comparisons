Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The group has been playing D&D for two years with six people. Adam invited his coworker, Sarah, to join. D&D involves a lot of math, mostly simple addition and subtraction. Sarah's turns take 7-8 minutes because she's slow at adding even single-digit numbers. They tried giving her another chance after Adam helped her at work, but it didn't work out. Sarah ended up frustrated, snapped at people, cried, and left. Now the author feels guilty and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author was wrong to push for Sarah's removal. Let's consider the factors. On one hand, D&D requires quick calculations for smooth gameplay. If one player is significantly slowing down the game, it affects everyone's experience. The group had tried being patient, even giving her formulas and giving Adam time to help. But it didn't help, leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown. \n\nOn the other hand, social dynamics matter. The group is friends, and including someone who can't keep up might not be fair to them either. But Sarah did enjoy the game. The author was the main one pushing to remove her, which could be seen as insensitive, especially since it led to her emotional distress. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. outcome. The author's intent was to maintain the game's pace and enjoyment for the group. However, the outcome was negative for Sarah. Were there alternatives? Maybe adjusting the game rules to reduce math, using apps or tools to help with calculations, or having a helper during her turns. But the group didn't try those. Instead, they gave her a chance to improve, which didn't work, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's frustration might be justified, but the way it was handled could be seen as harsh. The group's decision to remove Sarah, even with Adam's hesitation, resulted in her leaving upset. The author's guilt suggests they realize the emotional impact. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the group made a collective decision, the blame isn't solely on the author. But since the author was the main driver, they might feel more responsible. However, it's a group activity, so shared responsibility. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe because they didn't consider accommodations first, but the situation is complex. Sarah's inability to perform the math isn't a disability, so it's more about personal skill. However, forcing someone out because of that could be seen as unkind. \n\nAlternatively, the group has the right to set expectations for participation. If the rules include needing to keep up with the game's pace, then Sarah's inability might be a problem. But the way they handled the removal was abrupt and caused harm. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's feelings, leading to a negative outcome. Or B (No) because they tried to accommodate and had valid concerns about the game's pace. \n\nBut considering the emotional impact and the lack of alternative solutions explored, leaning towards A. The author's guilt and Sarah's breakdown indicate that their actions were wrong, despite the initial reasoning.\n"
