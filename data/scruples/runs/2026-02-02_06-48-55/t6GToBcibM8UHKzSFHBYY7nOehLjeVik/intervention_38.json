Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the D&D group situation is in the wrong. The author of the post is considering themselves possibly an asshole (AITA) for kicking someone out of the group due to their math speed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The group has six players, and Sarah was invited by Adam. She takes much longer than others to do her turns, even after having written down formulas. The group tried to give her another chance, but even after Adam helped her, she remained slow and eventually became upset, leading to her leaving.\n\nThe key points here are: the group's frustration with the game's pace vs. Sarah's enjoyment and well-being. The author admits to being the primary force behind removing Sarah and feeling guilty. They also note that Sarah was having fun but struggled with the math, which is part of the game. The group tried to accommodate her, but the end result was emotional distress for Sarah.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics and empathy, is the author wrong? Well, D&D requires a certain level of math, but it's not inherently a math competition. The group's main issue is the game's flow, but they should also consider the player's comfort. Forcing someone out because of a skill they can't control (like math speed) could be seen as insensitive. However, the group's experience is also valid; long turns can disrupt the game's pace. The problem is that they handled it poorly, leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the harm done, even if they thought it was necessary for the group's sake.\n\nThe other side is that maybe Sarah could have found ways to participate more efficiently, but the group's approach of giving a chance and then removing her might not be the best solution. The author's role in pushing for her removal, despite the consequences, makes them at least partially responsible. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their group's experience over Sarah's well-being and didn't find alternative solutions.\n"
