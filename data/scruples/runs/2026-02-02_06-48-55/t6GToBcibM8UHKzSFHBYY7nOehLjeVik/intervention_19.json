Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns, causing frustration. The author, who was the main person pushing to remove her, now feels guilty after Sarah broke down in tears and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. D&D is a game that relies on cooperation and social interaction. The group is spending a lot of time waiting for Sarah, which affects everyone's enjoyment. However, removing someone from a social group can be a big decision. The author's intention was to preserve the group's time and fun, but the result was hurt feelings and a strained relationship, especially with a coworker involved.\n\nThe author's actions led to Sarah leaving the group and being upset. Even though Adam tried to help Sarah improve, it didn't work out. The group's decision to remove her might have been harsh, especially since Sarah was having fun despite the struggles. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might not have considered the emotional impact on Sarah. The guilt they feel now suggests they recognized that their approach might have been too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the group did try to address the issue by giving Sarah another chance and asking Adam to help. But when that failed, their main concern was the game's pace. It's a balance between respecting everyone's time and being inclusive. The key here is whether the author's actions were necessary or if there were other solutions, like using a calculator or adjusting the game to reduce the math load.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid concerns about the game's flow, the way they handled the situation\u2014leading to Sarah's emotional distress\u2014probably made them the asshole. They should have explored more supportive solutions before deciding to remove her. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
