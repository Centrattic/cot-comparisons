Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who started the D&D group and kicked Sarah out is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nThe user is part of a D&D group with 6 people. Adam invited his coworker Sarah to join. D&D involves a lot of math, which isn't hard but is frequent. Sarah takes way longer than everyone else. They tried giving her a chance, but after Adam tried to help her with math, it didn't work, and Sarah became frustrated and left in tears. The user feels guilty and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. The author says that Sarah's turns take 7-8 minutes because she can't do simple math quickly. The group tried to be patient, but eventually, they decided to remove her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The user was the one pushing for it and now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, consider the group's right to have fun. D&D requires time management and cooperation. If one person is significantly slowing down the game, it affects everyone's experience. But on the other hand, excluding someone because they can't perform a task might be seen as cruel, especially if it's causing them emotional distress.\n\nBut wait, the group did give her another chance when Adam asked. They even allowed Adam to help her, which didn't work. The problem was that Sarah's pace was affecting the whole group's time. They had limited sessions, and the game wasn't getting done. The user's frustration is understandable because they wanted the game to be fun for everyone.\n\nHowever, the way they handled it might have been harsh. Maybe there were other solutions they could have tried, like using pre-calculated numbers or apps to speed things up. But the group did make an effort to help her. The fact that Sarah ended up crying and left shows that the action had a negative impact on her, even if the intention was to improve the group's experience.\n\nThe key point is whether the group was reasonable in their approach. They did try to accommodate her, but when that failed, they decided to remove her. The user was the main proponent of this, but Adam was worried about work dynamics. The outcome was that Sarah left upset, which is unfortunate.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the group did make a collective decision after Adam's attempt failed. However, the user's role in pushing for her removal and the resulting emotional harm might mean they share some responsibility. The question is if they're in the wrong. Since the group's actions led to Sarah's distress, even if the intention was to maintain game enjoyment, the method might be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut D&D is a social activity that relies on mutual enjoyment. If one person's actions (or inability) are making the game unenjoyable for others, there's a case for the group to set boundaries. However, the way they handled it without finding other solutions first could be a problem.\n\nI think the user isn't entirely in the wrong because the group did make efforts to help Sarah. However, the outcome was hurtful. So maybe they are partially at fault. But according to the options, it's A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The answer might lean towards A because the action caused emotional harm, even if the intention was to maintain group fun.\n"
