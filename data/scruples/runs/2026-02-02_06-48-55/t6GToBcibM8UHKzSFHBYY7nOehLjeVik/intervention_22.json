Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is being asked to leave because she's too slow at doing the math during turns. The author was the main person pushing to remove her and now feels guilty after she broke down in tears.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. D&D requires some math, but it's not super complex. Sarah's slow turns are causing the game to take longer than it should. The group tried to give her another chance by having Adam help her at work, but it didn't work out. The result was Sarah getting frustrated and emotional, leading her to quit.\n\nThe author is conflicted. They wanted to improve the game's flow, which is understandable. But the way they handled it led to Sarah being upset. The key points are: 1) The author was the main one advocating for removing Sarah. 2) They tried a solution with Adam, which didn't work. 3) The outcome was Sarah leaving in tears, and the author feels guilty.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Was the author justified in wanting to remove Sarah? The group has a right to enjoy their game, but they also have a responsibility to consider others' feelings. The author's approach was confrontational, leading to a negative outcome. Even though they tried to give Sarah another chance, the method might have been too harsh. The author's frustration led to a solution that backfired.\n\nThe group's decision to remove her might be seen as a last resort, but the way it was executed was poor. The author's primary role in pushing for it makes them responsible. They didn't consider alternative solutions, like helping Sarah in another way or adjusting the game's pace. The result was emotional harm to Sarah, which is significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the group's time and enjoyment are also important. They have a right to set boundaries. However, the approach should be considerate. The author might not be the sole \"asshole,\" but their actions contributed to the problem. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized the group's needs over Sarah's feelings and didn't handle the situation with enough empathy.\n"
