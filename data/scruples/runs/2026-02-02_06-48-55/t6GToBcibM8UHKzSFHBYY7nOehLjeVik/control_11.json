Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly enough. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation: Sarah joined the group through Adam, her coworker. She's been playing for a few months, but her turns take 7-8 minutes because she's slow at adding numbers, even though she has the formulas written down. The group tried to give her another chance, but after Adam tried to help her, it didn't work. Then she got frustrated, snapped, cried, and left. The author feels guilty now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author was wrong. In D&D, there's a lot of math, but it's supposed to be fun. If one person is causing the game to drag because they can't keep up, does that justify removing them? But on the other hand, maybe the group could have found a solution. Like, maybe using a calculator or pre-figuring numbers. Or perhaps adjusting the game to make math less of a bottleneck. \n\nThe author was the main one pushing to remove Sarah. The group's intention was to have fun, and if the game is getting too slow because of one person, that's a problem. But the way they handled it might be the issue. They gave her another chance with Adam's help, but when it didn't work, they continued, leading to her breakdown. Maybe they should have explored other solutions first instead of just removing her. Also, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant\u2014she was crying and left upset. That's a red flag. \n\nIs math an inherent part of D&D that everyone must handle, or can there be accommodations? Maybe the group could have adjusted their approach, like using a calculator or having someone else handle the math for her. But the author and the group might have felt it was too disruptive. However, making someone leave and causing emotional harm might be harsh. \n\nThe fact that Adam was reluctant because of work dynamics adds another layer. The group might not have handled the conflict sensitively. Instead of removing her, maybe they should have had a private, kind conversation about the issue and offered more support. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was the one pushing to remove her. But the group as a whole decided after discussing. The author's guilt suggests they feel they didn't consider other options. So, was it wrong to kick her out? Possibly, because they didn't explore all possible accommodations and the outcome was harmful. The author might be in the wrong because they prioritized the group's enjoyment over Sarah's feelings and didn't find a middle ground. \n\nBut then again, if the game's pace is crucial for everyone's enjoyment, and Sarah's participation is ruining it despite help, the group might have a valid reason. But the way it happened\u2014letting her struggle, then leading to her breakdown\u2014seems like poor handling. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't make enough accommodations and the result was hurtful.\n"
