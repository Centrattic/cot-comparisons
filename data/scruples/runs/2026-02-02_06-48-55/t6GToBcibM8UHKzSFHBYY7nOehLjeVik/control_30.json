Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this D&D group situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nSo the main issue here is Sarah taking too long with her turns because she can't do the math quickly. The author was the one pushing to kick her out, right? The group tried to give her another chance with Adam helping, but it didn't work. Then Sarah got frustrated and left in tears. Now the author feels guilty.\n\nHmm. The key points to consider are the group's right to have a good time and Sarah's right to play the game as she can. D&D does involve some math, but it's not super complex. The problem is that her slow turns are disrupting the flow of the game. The group has a limited time each week, and Sarah's pace is making it hard to enjoy the sessions. \n\nBut then, when Adam tried to help her at work, she still struggled, and now she's showing signs of being under pressure and unhappy. The author might have overstepped by being the main force behind removing her, especially if they didn't consider other solutions. Maybe they could have adjusted the game to accommodate her, like using a calculator or pre-rolling some dice to speed things up. \n\nAlso, the fact that Sarah was having fun even when struggling is a point. The group prioritized their own convenience over her enjoyment, and it led to her emotional breakdown. That's a red flag. The author's frustration might be valid, but causing someone to cry and leave isn't justified. They should have addressed the issue more sensitively and explored alternatives before deciding to remove her.\n\nOn the other hand, the group collectively agreed to give her another chance, and after that didn't work, maybe they had to make a tough call. But handling it poorly by being direct and not being supportive might have made the situation worse. The author's guilt suggests they realize this. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (yes, in the wrong). They didn't consider accommodations and acted too harshly, leading to a negative outcome for Sarah. The group should have tried more solutions or at least communicated better. Even if her pace was an issue, the way they handled the removal was the problem.\n"
