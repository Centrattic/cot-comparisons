Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who started the post is in the wrong. So the situation is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking too long with the math parts. The group eventually kicks her out, and the author is feeling guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the points. The main issue is that Sarah's slow math is causing the game to drag, making the session less enjoyable for everyone. The group tried giving her another chance, but it didn't work out, and Sarah ended up upset and crying. The author was the one pushing for her removal.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're an asshole (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether the author's actions were justified or not.\n\nOn one hand, Sarah was struggling with something that's a basic part of the game (math). Maybe she didn't realize how essential quick math is for D&D. The group tried to accommodate her by giving her time, but it still didn't help. The author's frustration is understandable if they're losing a lot of game time because of her.\n\nOn the other hand, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They decided to kick her out without maybe trying other solutions first. For example, could they have paired her with someone to help her during the game? Or maybe simplified the math in some way? Also, even though Adam's coworker, Sarah, was having fun, the group's decision led to her emotional breakdown, which is a big deal.\n\nThe group did try to warn Adam that Sarah's slow math was a problem, and when he tried to help her, the pressure made her frustrated. The author might have been too focused on their own frustration rather than being considerate of Sarah's feelings. They were the main one pushing for her removal, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut then again, D&D requires a certain level of participation. If someone can't keep up with the pace, it affects everyone else's experience. The group is a weekly event for 6 people, so time management is important. The author might not be the sole blame here, but their role in initiating the kickout is significant.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the group make a reasonable effort to include Sarah before removing her? They gave her time, tried having Adam help, but maybe didn't explore other options. Also, the way they communicated their expectations might have been too harsh, leading to her distress.\n\nIn the end, Sarah left on bad terms. The author feels guilty, which suggests they recognize that their actions might have been too harsh. So maybe they are in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's well-being without sufficient alternatives tried.\n"
