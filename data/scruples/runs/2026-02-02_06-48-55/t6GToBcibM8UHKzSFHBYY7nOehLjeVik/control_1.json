Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who asked the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is taking way too long on her turns because she's slow at mental math. The group eventually kicked her out, but she ended up crying and leaving upset. The author is feeling guilty and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D is a game that involves a lot of math, even if it's simple, but it's part of the gameplay. The main issue here is the time Sarah is taking, which affects the entire group's experience. The group tried to give her another chance by having Adam help her at work, but it didn't work. Then Sarah became frustrated and emotional, leading to her leaving.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the story, the group was patient initially, gave her time, and even tried an intervention. However, the problem persisted, and the group was spending a lot of time waiting for her. On the other hand, the way they handled the situation might have been harsh. They didn't directly tell her she was too slow but decided to remove her, which caused emotional distress.\n\nThe author was the main one pushing for removal, which might make them responsible. But D&D is a social activity, and everyone's enjoyment matters. If one person's pace is ruining the fun for others, the group has a right to address it. However, they could have handled it more sensitively\u2014maybe with a private talk to explain the issue and see if she wanted to adjust or if another role in the group could be assigned where math isn't as critical.\n\nThe fact that Sarah was having fun despite the struggles complicates things. Kicking her out caused her emotional harm, and the group didn't manage it well. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of removal wasn't handled with enough care. In conclusion, while the group had valid reasons for wanting faster gameplay, the way they handled the situation and the emotional impact on Sarah suggests the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
