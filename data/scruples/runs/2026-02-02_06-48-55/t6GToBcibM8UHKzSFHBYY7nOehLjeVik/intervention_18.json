Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she can't do math quickly. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that Sarah's slow turns are causing the game to be unenjoyable for the group. D&D already takes a long time, and her turns, which take 7-8 minutes, are making the sessions even longer. The group gave her a chance, tried to help her improve with Adam's assistance, but it didn't work. Eventually, Sarah had a meltdown and left. The author feels guilty but initially wanted her out for the group's enjoyment.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was having fun, even if she struggled. The group's decision might have been harsh, especially since they tried to accommodate her first. However, the game's pace is a collective experience, and if one person's slow down affects everyone else's enjoyment, it's a valid concern. But the way they handled it\u2014removing her after she was already stressed\u2014might have been too abrupt and hurtful.\n\nThe key points are: they gave her a chance, tried to help, but the problem persisted. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome was negative for Sarah. It's a tough balance between group dynamics and being inclusive. The author's primary motivation was frustration, which might make them more responsible for the outcome. But it's also possible that they were trying to preserve the group's experience. However, the result was Sarah being upset, so maybe the approach was wrong. I think the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's feelings and well-being, even if they tried to address the issue first.\n"
