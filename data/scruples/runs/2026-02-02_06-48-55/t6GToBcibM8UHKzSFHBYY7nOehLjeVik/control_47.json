Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who asked if they're the asshole) is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she couldn't do the math quickly enough.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group had Sarah join a few months ago. She takes much longer than others to do the math required for her turns, even with notes. The group is frustrated because their sessions are getting too long, and they only get 90 minutes of actual game time in a 3-4 hour session. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work, and Sarah ended up upset and left in tears. The author was the main one pushing to remove her and now feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points are: the group's enjoyment vs. Sarah's inability to keep up. The author's actions led to Sarah leaving, which caused her emotional distress. The group considered Adam's workplace relationship when deciding not to kick her initially, but after failing to help her improve, they proceeded. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, Sarah was having fun, but the group's time was being impacted. However, the way they handled it led to her emotional breakdown. The author was the primary person wanting her out. Even if the group's decision was made collectively, the author's role in pushing for it makes them a key player here. They didn't find alternative solutions before removing her. Maybe they could have adjusted the game to help her, like using calculators or having someone assist her turns. Instead, they gave a chance that didn't work, then removed her, leading to negative consequences. The author's frustration might be valid, but the outcome was harmful. So the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate towards Sarah's feelings and well-being, making them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
