Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group kicking out a player, Sarah, because she's slow at doing the math during her turns. The author was the main person pushing for her removal, and now they feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not supposed to be too complex. The problem is Sarah's speed. She takes 7-8 minutes per turn, which is way longer than others. The group tried giving her another chance when Adam suggested it, but it didn't work out. Then Sarah got frustrated and emotional, leading to her leaving the game.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they were the main one wanting to remove Sarah. But was that the right decision? They had good intentions initially, thinking it's about the game's flow and everyone's enjoyment. However, the outcome was harmful to Sarah's feelings. The group could have tried other solutions first, like helping her with the math, using calculators, or taking turns to assist her. Instead, they opted for removal after one attempt to help. That might have been a hasty decision.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration might have overshadowed consideration for Sarah's experience. Even though Adam was worried about work relationships, the group still went through with the decision once it was clear Sarah wasn't improving. The emotional impact on Sarah is significant, and the author's guilt suggests they realize that. Maybe they didn't consider alternatives or the emotional toll before acting.\n\nOn the other hand, the group did try to help once by having Adam work with her. But maybe that wasn't enough. The problem was ongoing, and the game sessions were too long. However, the way they handled it led to Sarah's breakdown. So, while the group's intention was to maintain their game's pace, they might have mishandled the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's primary role in pushing for Sarah's removal, despite the negative outcome, likely makes them at least partially responsible. They didn't explore enough alternatives and acted on their frustration without considering the emotional consequences properly. So, the answer is A.\n"
