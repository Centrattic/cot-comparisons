Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. So, the author is part of a group that kicked someone out of their game because she was too slow at doing the math required for her turns. The main question is whether they were justified in doing so, or if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The group has six members, they play weekly. Adam invited his coworker Sarah to join. D&D involves a fair amount of math, but it's not super advanced. Sarah takes way longer than others\u2014up to 7-8 minutes per turn, which is 10 times longer than others. They tried giving her another chance if Adam could help her at work, but that didn't work. Sarah became frustrated, had a breakdown, and left. The author feels guilty now, wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the impact on the group's enjoyment vs. Sarah's experience. The author was pushing to remove her, which led to a negative outcome. The group's time is limited, and Sarah's slow play was causing delays. But forcing her out resulted in her emotional distress.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the group's time is valuable, and everyone else's enjoyment is affected. On the other, they could have tried alternative solutions. Maybe they could have adjusted the game to accommodate her, like using more pre-calculated numbers, using apps or tools to help with math, or having someone assist her during her turns. The fact that they tried once (Adam helping) but didn't explore other options might be a problem.\n\nAlso, Adam was concerned about work relationships, and the group didn't take his concerns seriously. The author was the main push for removal, which might have been harsh. The outcome was that Sarah left upset, which seems like a negative consequence. The author's guilt suggests they realize this. However, the group's frustration with the time is also valid. But the way they handled it\u2014threatening to kick her out and not providing adequate support\u2014might be where they went wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They contributed to a decision that hurt someone's feelings and led to her leaving. While the group's time is important, the method of addressing the issue was perhaps too abrupt. There might be a better way to handle it without making someone feel excluded. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized the group's time over Sarah's experience without sufficient effort to find a compromise. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
