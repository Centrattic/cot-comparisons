Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe group plays D&D with 6 people, and they've been playing for two years. Adam invited his coworker Sarah to join, which she did a few months ago. The issue is that Sarah takes a long time to do the math during her turns\u2014like 7-8 minutes because adding three single-digit numbers takes her a minute. The group thought maybe she was nervous or learning the rules, but she has all the formulas written down. They tried giving her another chance if Adam, her coworker, could help her at work. Adam tried for a week but it didn't help. Then Sarah became frustrated and ended up crying during the session. Now she's not playing anymore, and they're feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the person who posted) is in the wrong. The author admits they were the primary one pushing to remove Sarah and felt the most frustrated. Now they're feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, D&D does involve math, but it's not that complex. However, Sarah's slowness is affecting the group's enjoyment. The group tried to accommodate her by giving her more time and another chance with Adam's help. When that didn't work, they decided to remove her. But the removal led to Sarah's emotional breakdown. \n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game and not have sessions dragged out. The author was frustrated and wanted things to move along. On the other hand, they might not have considered that Sarah's difficulty could be a cognitive or emotional issue. Maybe she has a learning disability or anxiety that's making things slow. The group didn't approach this with enough empathy. Instead of kicking her out, maybe they could have found alternative solutions, like pre-rolling dice or using apps to speed up her turns. \n\nAlso, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They didn't communicate their concerns to Sarah directly. They let Adam try to help, but even that led to pressure on Sarah. When she started to struggle and showed frustration, they didn't adjust their approach. Instead of cutting the session short and removing her, maybe they could have taken a break or adjusted the game to be more inclusive. \n\nThe fact that Sarah was genuinely having fun despite the struggles suggests that the group's actions might have been too abrupt. They prioritized their own enjoyment over her feelings and didn't consider alternative solutions. The author's role in pushing for her removal and the resulting emotional harm makes them at least partially responsible. \n\nIn social groups, especially games like D&D, it's important to balance everyone's needs. The group's approach might have been too rigid. They should have explored more options before deciding to remove Sarah. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being more accommodating and for the way they handled the situation, leading to Sarah's distress.\n"
