Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the D&D group who kicked Sarah out is the asshole. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a D&D group with 6 people, and Sarah was invited by Adam. Combat in D&D involves a lot of math, even if it's simple, but Sarah is really slow at it. Her turns take 7-8 minutes, which is way longer than others. They tried giving her another chance with Adam helping, but she stayed slow and got upset, leading to her crying and leaving. The author is feeling guilty now and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the group's enjoyment versus Sarah's ability to play. The group's time is limited to 3-4 hours, and Sarah's long turns are making the game less fun for everyone. But was the way they handled it wrong?\n\nWell, the author was the main one pushing to remove her. The group didn't address the problem with her first, maybe. They could have tried to help her more. But they did let Adam try to assist her, and that didn't work. Then when she got frustrated, they continued, leading to her breakdown. \n\nWait, when her turns became slower and she was frustrated, the group didn't adjust. Maybe they could have given her more support, like using calculators, simplifying the combat math, or taking turns helping her. Instead, they created a situation where she felt pressured and then kicked her out. That might be the problem. \n\nAlso, Sarah was having fun even when struggling, so the group might not have considered that she's enjoying the game despite the math. The author might be prioritizing the game's pace over her experience. Maybe they should have adapted the game to accommodate her rather than removing her. \n\nBut Adam tried to help. The group did give her a chance. However, using the work context to imply that maybe she wasn't being taken seriously? Like, maybe the group approached it in a harsh way. It's possible that the author was too focused on the speed and didn't handle the situation with empathy. \n\nIn social groups, especially games, it's important to consider all members' experiences. If the game is taking too long, maybe the solution is to find ways to help her instead of excluding her. The fact that she left in tears and the author feels guilty suggests that the approach was too abrupt or harsh. They might not have communicated the issue effectively, leading to her frustration. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to a negative outcome for Sarah. Even if the group had a valid reason (long turns), the way they handled it\u2014primarily the author pushing for removal and the lack of support\u2014could be seen as wrong. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. If the group tried their best and she still couldn't keep up, then maybe B. But the problem is that they didn't try enough accommodations before removing her. \n\nAnother angle: D&D is a social game, and the group should adjust to make it inclusive. Maybe they should have allowed her to use a calculator or a reference sheet, or take turns helping her with the math. Since they didn't do that and instead focused on removing her, that's where the issue lies. So yes, the author is in the wrong because they didn't try to solve the problem together but instead opted to exclude her, leading to her emotional distress.\n"
