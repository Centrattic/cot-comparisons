Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking much longer than others to take her turns because she's slow at math. The group decides to kick her out after she starts crying and leaves. The poster feels guilty but was the main person pushing for her removal. Now they're wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, so they want to know if that's accurate. I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nD&D is a group activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person is significantly slowing down the game, it affects the enjoyment for everyone else. The group did try to address the issue first by giving Sarah another chance with Adam's help. However, that didn't work, and Sarah became frustrated and upset. The poster was the main one pushing for her removal and felt the most frustration.\n\nBut here's the thing: the group did make an effort to help her improve. They gave her time and support through Adam. When that failed, the situation led to Sarah's emotional breakdown. The poster's guilt is evident. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, they acted out of concern for the group's enjoyment, which is understandable. However, they might have failed to consider alternative solutions, like using calculators or apps to speed things up, or maybe adjusting their own patience. Also, the way they handled the removal might have been too abrupt, leading to Sarah's distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the group had a legitimate issue with game time being wasted. Sarah's slow pace was affecting the overall experience. The poster's frustration isn't entirely unfounded. The problem was more about the inability to find a compromise that worked for everyone. The key point is that they didn't try all possible accommodations before deciding to remove her. Maybe they could have adjusted the game's structure, like assigning certain roles that require less math, or using pre-calculated sheets. The fact that Sarah was enjoying the game despite her struggles shows she wanted to be part of the group. The group's response might have been too harsh, especially since they realized she wasn't having fun after the removal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the poster is probably in the wrong because they didn't explore enough alternatives and the removal caused emotional harm. Even though the issue existed, the handling was problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
