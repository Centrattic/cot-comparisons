Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their D&D group because they can't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The poster (author) is part of a D&D group that Adam, another player, brought in a coworker named Sarah. Sarah is taking a very long time on her turns, even though she has the formulas written down. The group is frustrated because the game time isn't fun anymore, and they end up cutting Sarah out after she has an emotional breakdown. The author feels guilty and is questioning if they were the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points are: Sarah's slow pace is affecting the game's enjoyment for everyone. The group tried to give her another chance after Adam suggested it, but it didn't work. Sarah ended up upset and left. The author was the main advocate for removing her but now feels guilty.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. D&D is a social activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person's slow pace is causing the game to drag and making it less enjoyable for others, there's a valid concern. However, the way they handled it might be problematic. They didn't try alternative solutions first, like helping her in-game with a helper, using calculators, or adjusting game mechanics. Instead, they decided to remove her, leading to her emotional distress.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but kicking someone out without exhausting all possible accommodations could be seen as harsh. The group should have considered more support for Sarah before taking such a step. The fact that Adam was worried about work awkwardness and Sarah's enjoyment suggests that the group didn't fully consider the personal impact. The outcome was harmful to Sarah's feelings, which is a significant factor.\n\nSo, while the group had valid reasons for wanting the game to be enjoyable, their approach was flawed. They didn't make reasonable adjustments to help Sarah improve her speed. The author, being the primary force behind the decision, might be in the wrong because they didn't ensure that all alternatives were explored before removing her. The emotional harm caused to Sarah indicates that the approach was too harsh and not empathetic enough.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider alternative solutions and the emotional impact on Sarah before removing her from the group.\n"
