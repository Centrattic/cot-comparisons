Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where they kicked out a player, Sarah, because she was too slow at doing the math during her turns. The author was the one pushing for her removal and is now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Sarah was invited by Adam, and she's been playing for a few months. The math involved isn't complex, but she's taking way longer than others, like 7-8 minutes per turn. The group tried giving her another chance, with Adam trying to help her speed up, but it didn't work. Eventually, she got frustrated, snapped, and cried, leading to her leaving the group.\n\nNow, assessing whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent, actions, and consequences. The author wanted to remove Sarah because of the game's pace, but the outcome was harmful to her emotionally. The group did try to accommodate her first with Adam's help. However, even after that, the problem persisted, leading to a tense situation. \n\nBut maybe there were other options they could have considered before removing her. For example, using calculators, pre-calculating numbers, or having a helper. The author's frustration might have led to hasty decisions without exhausting all possible solutions. Also, the fact that Sarah was having fun initially but ended up upset suggests that the group's actions negatively impacted her experience. \n\nEven if the group felt it was necessary for their own enjoyment, the way they handled it caused emotional distress. The author was the main driver, so their guilt is valid. They might not be \"in the wrong\" in wanting to address the game's pace, but their approach may have been harsh or not considerate enough of Sarah's feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, a common factor is whether the person had a valid reason but acted inconsiderately. The author's intention was to maintain game time, which is understandable. However, the outcome was hurtful, so there's a balance. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they tried to address the issue and the group collectively decided to remove her, but maybe the execution was flawed. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the removal was unnecessarily harsh without more accommodations. \n\nLooking at the responses, often in these cases, if the group made a collective decision and tried to help, it's less the individual's fault. However, the emotional impact suggests that perhaps they should have found another solution. But since the author was the primary driver, maybe they are partially at fault. However, the final answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the group made the decision together, and the math issue was affecting everyone's experience. The answer might be B.\n"
