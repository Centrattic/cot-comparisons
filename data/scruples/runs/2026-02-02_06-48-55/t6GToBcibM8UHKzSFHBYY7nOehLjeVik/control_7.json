Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she couldn't do the math quickly enough. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is part of a D&D group that Sarah joined through Adam, her coworker. The game involves a lot of math, mostly simple addition and subtraction. Sarah's turns take way longer than others\u20147-8 minutes each, which is much longer than the others' 1-2 minutes. This causes the game time to be stretched out over 3-4 hours, with not much actual gameplay. The group considered removing her, except Adam wanted to avoid work awkwardness. They gave her another chance with Adam's help, but that didn't work. Sarah ended up frustrated, had a meltdown, and left. Now the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the group's time management issues, the impact on Sarah's enjoyment, and the methods used to address the problem.\n\nOn one hand, D&D is a group activity where everyone's participation affects the whole experience. If one person's slow turns are making the game less enjoyable for others due to time constraints, that's a valid concern. The author and the group tried to address it by giving Adam a chance to help Sarah, but it didn't work. The problem persisted, leading to a negative outcome.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's approach might have been too harsh. Instead of just removing Sarah, maybe there were alternative solutions. For example, using a calculator or phone for math, having someone assist her during the game, or adjusting the game's complexity. The group didn't mention trying these options. Also, Sarah was having fun until she was pressured to speed up, which led to her frustration and emotional breakdown. That suggests that the way the group handled the situation was part of the problem.\n\nThe author was the one pushing to remove Sarah, and while their frustration is understandable, the result was harmful. The group could have been more accommodating or found compromises. Removing a player because they have a different pace, especially if it's a known issue (like Adam said she's slow at work), might not be fair. The author's guilt indicates they realized that their actions led to a bad outcome, which points to them being at least partially responsible.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions contributed to a negative experience for Sarah. They might not have considered alternatives and acted too hastily. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
