Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is really slow at doing the math required for the game. The author is part of the group and was the main person pushing to kick Sarah out because her slow turns were making the game sessions drag. But after they tried to give her another chance, she got frustrated and left in tears. Now the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex. Sarah's issue is that she takes much longer than others, even with written formulas. The group tried to help her by having Adam (her coworker and friend) assist her, but that didn't work. The problem escalated to the point where Sarah was upset and left. The author feels they're the asshole for pushing to remove her.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game time. If one person's pace is making the whole session too long and less fun for everyone else, it's a valid concern. The author wasn't the only one considering removing Sarah\u2014others were on board except Adam. They did give her a chance with Adam's help, which shows they tried to accommodate her. But maybe they didn't consider other solutions, like using a calculator or apps that help with D&D math, which could have made things faster for Sarah without requiring her to do mental math quickly. \n\nOn the other hand, the way they handled it might have been too harsh. The fact that Sarah was genuinely having fun and got frustrated when pressured to speed up suggests that the group's approach was not sensitive enough. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome was that Sarah was hurt and left the group. The author's initial push to remove her might have contributed to the negative outcome, even if their intention was to preserve the group's game time.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did they talk to Sarah directly about the issue before deciding to remove her? It seems like they discussed it among themselves and with Adam, but maybe Sarah wasn't aware of how her slowness was affecting the group. If they had communicated openly and offered alternative solutions, maybe the situation could have been resolved differently. \n\nAlso, mental math speed can vary a lot between individuals. Maybe Sarah has other challenges, like anxiety or a learning difference, that make math slower for her. The group didn't consider accommodations beyond what Adam could do during lunch. The author's frustration led to a solution that was too abrupt and hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the group had a valid concern about the game's pacing, the way they handled it without considering other solutions or communicating directly with Sarah might have been the wrong approach. The author's role in pushing for her removal could be seen as wrong because it led to a negative outcome for Sarah, even if the intention was to improve the group's experience.\n"
