Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns. The group tried to help her, but when they eventually decided to kick her out, she broke down in tears and left. The author feels guilty and is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. D&D does involve a fair amount of math, which can be a barrier for some. Sarah's slowness was causing delays, and the group's enjoyment was affected. However, the group gave her a chance to improve, but it didn't work out. The key issue here is whether the group was reasonable in their approach and whether kicking her out was the right decision.\n\nThe author was the main person pushing to remove Sarah. They felt frustrated with the delays, which is understandable because everyone wants the game to be fun and efficient. But they also acknowledge that Sarah enjoyed the game. The group's intention was to maintain their own enjoyment without considering enough the impact on Sarah. They tried to help her by having Adam coach her, but that backfired, leading to her frustration and emotional breakdown.\n\nI think the problem is that they prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's well-being. Even though they tried to give her a chance, the approach might have been too harsh. They didn't maybe find other solutions, like using tools or apps to help with the math, or maybe taking turns helping her during the game. The fact that Sarah was upset and the author feels guilty now suggests that they might have overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the group had valid concerns about the game's pace. It's a balance between being inclusive and maintaining a fun environment for everyone. But the way they handled it, leading to an emotional breakdown, seems harsh. The author's role in pushing for removal is problematic because they didn't consider alternative solutions and the emotional toll on Sarah.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They should have found a more supportive solution rather than removing her from the group. The answer is A.\n"
