Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is that Sarah was taking too long to do the math during her turns, which was slowing down the game. The group considered removing her, and the author was the main one pushing for it. Then, after giving her another chance with Adam's help, Sarah ended up getting frustrated and crying, leading her to leave the group. The author is now feeling guilty and wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics of a D&D group. It's a collaborative game that relies on everyone's participation. If one person is significantly slowing down the game, it can affect the experience for others. However, the way they handled it is important. The group did try to give her another chance with Adam's support, but it didn't work. Sarah's emotional response suggests that their approach might have been too harsh or that their communication wasn't empathetic enough.\n\nThe key points are: the game's math isn't complex, but Sarah's pace was causing issues. The group did attempt to help her (with Adam's lunchtime sessions), but it didn't improve. Then, during the session, when they decided to end early, Sarah had an emotional breakdown. The author admits to being the primary driving force for removing her, which indicates they might have been the most aggressive in addressing the issue.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they might not be wrong for wanting the game to run smoothly. However, the approach could be questionable. Maybe they should have tried more alternative solutions first, like using pre-calculated numbers, apps, or other tools to help her with the math. Also, the fact that she was clearly distressed and ended up crying suggests that the group's method of handling the problem (even if it led to her leaving) might have been inconsiderate. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being the main push to remove her. They might have valid concerns about the game's flow, but the outcome was negative. The group could have been more understanding or found ways to accommodate her, such as using a calculator or having someone assist her. Removing her might have been necessary for the group's enjoyment, but the manner in which it was done\u2014without perhaps fully exploring other options\u2014could make them at fault.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the action of removing her was justified. Since the game is a social activity, the primary goal is enjoyment. If her presence is causing significant disruption, the group's decision could be seen as necessary. But if they could have adapted the game to her needs without making the game sessions unbearably long, maybe they should have tried that first. The fact that she was struggling and then upset after the session indicates that the group's approach might have been too abrupt or not empathetic enough. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not handling the situation more sensitively, even if the end result was necessary.\n"
