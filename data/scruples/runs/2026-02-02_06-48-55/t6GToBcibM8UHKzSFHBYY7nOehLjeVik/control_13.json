Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns, causing delays and frustration. The author wanted her to leave, and after some attempts to help her improve failed, the group ended up making her cry and she quit. The author feels guilty and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. D&D does involve math, but it's not supposed to be a barrier to entry. The group had tried to be patient and even gave Sarah another chance with Adam's help. However, the problem persisted, leading to a breakdown. The author was the main one pushing for removal but now feels guilty.\n\nThe main factors here are intent and impact. The group's intention was to have a fun, efficient game, which is understandable. However, the way they handled the situation might have been insensitive. The fact that Sarah was genuinely having fun but struggled with the math suggests that maybe there were other accommodations they could have made, like using a calculator or pre-figuring numbers. The group might have not considered alternative solutions before deciding to remove her. Also, the fact that Sarah ended up crying shows that their actions hurt her feelings, which is a significant negative impact.\n\nThe author's role was being the primary person advocating for her removal and feeling frustrated. While frustration is natural in such situations, the approach taken led to a negative outcome. The group could have explored more ways to support Sarah instead of giving her an ultimatum. The aftermath, where Sarah was upset and left, indicates that the method used was harsh. Even though Adam was concerned about work relations, the group's actions still caused harm.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't find a solution that balanced the group's needs with Sarah's abilities. Instead of removal, maybe adjusting the game to be more inclusive would have been better. The group's handling of the situation lacked empathy, especially since Sarah's enjoyment was evident despite her struggles. The fact that Adam's attempt to help didn't work doesn't absolve the group of responsibility; they should have tried other methods.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the group's approach was not considerate enough, leading to a hurtful outcome for Sarah. The author's frustration led to a decision that, while perhaps understandable, was not handled with sufficient sensitivity.\n"
