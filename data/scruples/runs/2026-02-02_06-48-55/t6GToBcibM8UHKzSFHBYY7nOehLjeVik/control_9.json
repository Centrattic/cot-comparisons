Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where someone, Sarah, is taking too long to do math during the game. The main question is whether they kicked her out for not being able to do math quickly, and if the author, who was the main person pushing for her removal, is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of calculations, even if they're simple. But Sarah was taking 7-8 minutes per turn because adding numbers was slow. The group felt it was taking too long and affecting their game time. They tried to give her another chance with Adam helping her, but it didn't work. Eventually, Sarah got frustrated, had a breakdown, and left.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the key points here are:\n\n1. **Was removing Sarah the right decision?** They tried to help her, but maybe they should have found another way first. For example, maybe they could have used a calculator or had someone else help her during the game. Kicking her out seems harsh if the problem could have been mitigated without exclusion.\n\n2. **Did they consider her feelings and enjoyment?** The author mentions that Sarah was having fun, even while struggling. Removing her led to her crying and leaving angry. That's a negative outcome, and they might have prioritized their own frustration over her enjoyment. The author was the main person pushing for her removal, so they might share more responsibility here.\n\n3. **Communication issues?** They didn't directly talk to Sarah about their concerns before deciding to remove her. Instead, they went through Adam, which might have caused misunderstandings and added pressure on her. Direct and kind communication could have been better to find a solution together.\n\n4. **Alternatives?** Maybe they could have adjusted the game format\u2014like taking turns helping with math, or using pre-calculated sheets. Excluding someone for a skill they lack is a last resort if other solutions aren't tried.\n\nOn the other hand, the group had a legitimate issue with game time being cut too short. Their frustration is understandable, and Adam's work relationship is a valid concern. But the way they handled it may have been too abrupt and not empathetic enough.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized the group's time over Sarah's feelings, didn't explore alternatives, and the outcome was harmful to Sarah. The action of removing her led to her emotional distress, which suggests that the group, and the author in particular, failed to handle the situation with empathy and problem-solving.\n"
