Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, gets kicked out because she's slow at doing the math required for the game. The author was the main person pushing for her removal, which led to Sarah crying and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex. The group has been playing for two years, and Sarah joined through Adam, a coworker. Her turns take way longer than others, even with written formulas. Initially, they thought it was nerves or learning, but it's been months. The group tried to give her another chance if Adam could help her speed up, but that didn't work. Then, during the game, Sarah got frustrated, snapped, and cried, leading to her leaving.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the group's time is limited, and Sarah's slow turns are affecting everyone's enjoyment. They tried to accommodate her by giving her another chance after Adam's intervention. However, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They didn't directly approach Sarah about the issue before deciding to remove her. Instead, they involved Adam, which might have put pressure on her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach could have been more empathetic.\n\nAlso, Sarah was having fun despite the struggles. The group's main goal should be enjoyment for everyone. Maybe there were alternative solutions they could have tried instead of removing her. For example, using a calculator or apps to speed up calculations, or having someone assist her during the game. By cutting her off completely, they might have been too quick to exclude her without exploring other options.\n\nThe author was the main driving force behind her removal and now feels guilty. This guilt suggests they recognize that their actions had negative consequences. The fact that Sarah left upset and the group is now dealing with the fallout indicates that their approach was flawed. Even though Adam was concerned about work dynamics, the group's handling of the situation wasn't considerate enough of Sarah's feelings and her enjoyment of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's some validity to the group's frustration, the way they handled the issue, especially the author's role in pushing for removal without proper communication and support, makes the author at least partially responsible. They could have been more understanding and found alternative solutions instead of resorting to exclusion.\n"
