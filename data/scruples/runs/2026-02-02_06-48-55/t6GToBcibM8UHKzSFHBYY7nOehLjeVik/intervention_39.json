Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long to do math for her turns. The author, who is part of the group, was the main one pushing to remove Sarah, which led to her emotional breakdown and quitting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The game has a lot of math, but it's supposed to be simple. Sarah was invited by Adam, and she's been playing for a few months. Even with written formulas, her turns are 7-8 minutes each, which is way longer than everyone else. The group tried giving her another chance if Adam could help her at work, but that didn't work. Then Sarah became frustrated and left in tears.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty now, wondering if they're the asshole. The question is whether their actions were wrong. \n\nLooking at the author's perspective, they were frustrated because the game time was being eaten up by Sarah's slower turns. The group's goal is to have fun together, and if one person is causing the game to drag, it affects everyone. The author's intention was probably to improve the group's experience, but they went about it by pushing for removal, which had negative consequences.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the group could have tried more accommodations first. Maybe they didn't explore enough alternatives, like pre-figuring numbers, using apps or tools to speed up calculations, or having someone else help her during the game. The fact that they resorted to removing her without trying those options might show a lack of consideration for her feelings and the reason behind her difficulty with math. Also, the fact that Adam mentioned she's slow at work too suggests there might be an underlying issue, like dyscalculia or anxiety, which the group didn't address.\n\nThe emotional impact on Sarah is significant. Her crying and snapping indicate that the pressure to perform was too much. The group might have been insensitive to her struggles, prioritizing their own enjoyment over her well-being. Even though the author was the main driver, the group as a whole agreed to give her another chance, but maybe the approach wasn't supportive enough. Also, the way the decision was made\u2014group texting to consider removal\u2014could have been harsh. They should have had a private, kind conversation with Sarah first to offer help rather than just deciding behind her back.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's usually best to address issues directly and compassionately. The group didn't do that and instead let the situation escalate to the point of emotional distress. The author's role in pushing for removal and the resulting outcome makes them complicit in the negative experience for Sarah. While the group had a valid concern about game time, their handling of it was flawed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and support for Sarah. They should have tried more inclusive solutions before considering removal. The emotional harm caused to Sarah is a key factor here, indicating that their approach was inappropriate even if their motivation was to improve the group's experience.\n"
