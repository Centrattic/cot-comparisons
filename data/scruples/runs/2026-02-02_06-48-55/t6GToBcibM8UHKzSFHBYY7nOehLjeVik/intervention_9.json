Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where someone (Sarah) is taking too long to do the math during her turns, causing frustration for the group. The author of the post wanted to remove Sarah because of her slow pace, but it ended up making Sarah upset and she quit. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not overly complex. The problem is Sarah's speed in processing the math, which is causing delays. The group tried to address it by giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work. The result was Sarah feeling pressured, becoming frustrated, and ultimately leaving in tears. The author admits they were the main person pushing for Sarah's removal and now feel guilty.\n\nI should think about the group dynamics. Social games like D&D are about enjoyment for everyone involved. If one person's pace is significantly slowing down the game, it affects the experience for others. But on the other hand, the group could have tried more accommodations. For example, maybe using pre-rolled stats, apps or calculators to help with math, or taking turns helping Sarah with her calculations. The group might have failed to adapt to her needs, which could be seen as a lack of consideration.\n\nThe author's approach was to push for removal rather than finding alternative solutions. That could be where the mistake was. The intention was to maintain game time, but the method led to emotional harm. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might have been too harsh. The alternative solutions could have been explored before deciding to remove Sarah. The fact that Sarah was having fun, even though she was slow, suggests that she was a positive addition, and the group's actions disrupted that.\n\nAlso, considering Adam's concern about work relationships, the group might not have handled the situation delicately enough. They could have approached Sarah privately, offered tools to help her, or adjusted their own approach to the game rather than excluding her. The outcome where Sarah left in tears indicates that the group's actions caused emotional distress, which is a strong point in determining fault.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is valid, the decision to push for Sarah's removal without exhausting other possible solutions seems to be in the wrong. The priority should have been to find a way for everyone to enjoy the game together, not at the expense of someone else's feelings.\n"
