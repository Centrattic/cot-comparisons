Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do math during her turns. The author of the post was the main one pushing to remove her, and now feels guilty after she had a breakdown and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a fair amount of math, but it's not supposed to be overly complex. Sarah's problem is her speed with basic calculations, which is affecting the game's flow. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam tried to help her at work, but it didn't work out, leading to her distress.\n\nNow, thinking about social dynamics and group activities. The main issue here is balancing the enjoyment of the group versus the individual's ability. The group's time is limited (3-4 hours), and if one person's pace is slowing everyone down, that's a valid concern. However, how they handled it is crucial. Forcing someone out because they can't meet a certain performance standard might be seen as harsh, especially if they're having fun.\n\nThe author was the main driver to remove Sarah, and there's a sense of guilt now. The key is whether the group communicated their concerns directly with Sarah before deciding to kick her out. If they approached her kindly and discussed the issue, maybe offering help, that might be different. But if they went behind her back and then excluded her, that's problematic.\n\nAlso, the fact that Adam tried to help her at work but it didn't improve suggests that maybe Sarah isn't in a position to speed up, or perhaps the problem is more about confidence or stress. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach taken\u2014group texting to decide removal without direct communication\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: group activities require cooperation. If someone's participation is causing significant delays, it's a group issue. However, the group should address it respectfully. The breakdown of Sarah's emotional state indicates that the method used was too harsh. The author's role in pushing for removal without a more supportive approach might make them an asshole.\n\nBut then, the group did give her a chance after Adam's attempt, and even then, it didn't work. They might have felt it was the only solution. However, the way it was handled\u2014without open communication and leading to her emotional breakdown\u2014shows that the author's approach was flawed. The guilt they feel now supports this.\n\nIn conclusion, while the group's frustration is valid, the manner in which they handled the situation, especially the author's push to remove Sarah without a more supportive approach, makes them at least partially at fault. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
