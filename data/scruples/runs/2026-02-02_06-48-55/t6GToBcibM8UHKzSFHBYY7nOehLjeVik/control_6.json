Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking a really long time to do her turns because she's slow at math. The group decided to kick her out after she had a breakdown during the session. The author was the main person pushing for her removal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the group's enjoyment is important. D&D is a group activity, and if one person is causing major delays, it affects everyone else. The author mentions that sessions are 3-4 hours, but they only get 90 minutes of actual gaming because of the time lost waiting for Sarah. That's a lot. It's possible that the group felt they had to make a choice to preserve their own enjoyment of the game.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was genuinely having fun, and her being kicked out led to her emotional breakdown. The author and the group might not have considered other solutions, like helping her with the math or adjusting the game to accommodate her. Even if Adam tried to help her at work, it didn't work. But maybe the approach was too abrupt. The way they handled the situation might have been harsh, not considering her feelings and the possibility of alternative solutions.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges their guilt now, which suggests they might feel they acted without fully considering the consequences. The fact that Sarah was crying and left angry indicates that the removal was hurtful. The group could have tried to be more patient or make adjustments, like allowing her to do calculations outside the session or using a calculator. Since D&D is a game meant to be fun and social, the group's decision to remove her over something that could be mitigated with support might be seen as insensitive.\n\nHowever, the group did give her a chance to improve with Adam's help, and when that didn't work, they had to make a decision to maintain the game's flow. It's a balance between group dynamics and individual needs. The key point is whether the author's actions were necessary or if they could have found a better solution. The emotional impact on Sarah seems significant, which weighs on the side of the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the group had valid concerns about the game's pace, the way they handled the situation, leading to Sarah's distress, makes the author (as the main instigator) possibly in the wrong. They might have been too focused on their own frustration without adequately considering Sarah's feelings and alternative solutions."
