Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The context is important here. They were talking about the topic of pregnancy, and she mentioned she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't give them up if she had one. The author made a joke but then escalated to a serious statement about leaving her if she got pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the implications of making such a statement. Pregnancy is a significant life event, and making a conditional statement about leaving based on it can affect the relationship's stability. The girlfriend is upset, feeling betrayed and that her partner doesn't support her. The author claims to love her but doesn't want kids, which is a valid personal choice. However, the way he communicated his stance\u2014threatening to leave\u2014might be problematic.\n\nNext, the question is whether this makes the author the asshole. From a relationship standpoint, trust and mutual support are crucial. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is questioned if she can't make a life decision without her partner threatening to leave. Even if the author has no intention of allowing children, the threat of leaving over a possible future event could be seen as controlling or fear-based.\n\nAlso, the author's financial concerns about a child affecting their life might be valid, but using that as a reason to abandon the relationship if a pregnancy occurs could be seen as selfish. Relationships require compromise and planning. If the author is adamant about no children, they should have discussed this earlier and found mutual understanding. However, making a conditional statement after a discussion where the partner doesn't want kids soon might be harsh, even if it's a hypothetical.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Feeling that her partner isn't loyal or responsible could stem from the threat being made during a vulnerable conversation. The author's approach seems to prioritize his own aversion to children over the relationship's future, which could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nMoreover, the timing of the statement matters. The conversation was about pregnancy, and the author escalated a joke to a firm declaration. This could be seen as using fear to control the situation rather than open communication. Healthy relationships involve discussing such important issues and finding solutions together, not making ultimatums based on hypotheticals.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his own reasons, the way he communicated his stance without considering the emotional impact on his partner likely made him the asshole. The key points are the ultimatum, the lack of prior discussion about their future regarding children, and the potential emotional harm caused.\n"
