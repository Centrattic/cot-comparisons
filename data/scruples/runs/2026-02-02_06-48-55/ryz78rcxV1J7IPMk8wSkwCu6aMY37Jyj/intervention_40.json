Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend that he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he can't stand children and doesn't want them. He made a joke that escalated into a serious statement about leaving. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that he's not loyal and has a negative view of women's responsibilities.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication style, the impact on the relationship, and mutual expectations. Making a joke about not giving the baby away might have been a trigger. Then, escalating to a direct threat to leave if she gets pregnant\u2014regardless of birth control\u2014seems harsh. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, how he communicated this is important. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to discuss major life decisions like having children. But doing so in a confrontational or ultimatum style can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and responsibilities might be valid because such a statement can feel like a betrayal of trust and a lack of support for her. \n\nEven if the author is truthful, the way he expressed it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and their relationship. It's possible he didn't consider the emotional impact. Also, the fact that he's using this as a condition for staying in the relationship might indicate that he's not prioritizing her autonomy or their future together. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being upfront about his stance on children, which is a significant aspect of a relationship. However, the method of communication matters. Using a joke to lead into a serious threat might not be the best approach. \n\nIn many cases, such ultimatums can be viewed as inconsiderate, especially if they come without prior discussion and mutual agreement. The girlfriend's feelings of being undervalued or disrespected are valid. So, while the author might not be \"asshole\" in the sense of having wrong intentions, his actions could be seen as inconsiderate and damaging to the relationship. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for the way he communicated his stance and the ultimatum.\n"
