Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. He says he can't stand children and doesn't want them, and he's worried about financial responsibilities and his life being ruined. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were talking about pregnancy and kids, and he made a joke, then escalated to a serious statement. The girlfriend's stance is that she wouldn't abort or give away a child, but she doesn't want kids soon. The author is firm that he can't handle having a kid, so he's saying he'd leave her if she got pregnant. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. But telling someone you'd leave them if they get pregnant is a big deal. Even if it's about a future hypothetical situation, it's a serious threat. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, maybe even dismissed. If he's not willing to be part of a family if she wants it, that's a fundamental incompatibility. \n\nHowever, the author argues that he's being honest and that he's not willing to compromise on his values. But is honesty an excuse for being hurtful? Maybe. But relationships often require compromise. If he's not open to changing his stance at all, maybe he shouldn't be in a relationship where the partner might want children in the future. \n\nThe problem here is that the author made a definitive statement without discussing it further. Even if he's not the type to want kids, the way he communicated it was blunt and possibly disrespectful. It's important to consider the partner's feelings and the potential consequences. The girlfriend's feelings about his loyalty and his view on women might stem from feeling that he's dismissive of her potential choices, especially since she's already stated she wouldn't abort a child. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the key point is that he communicated his stance in a hurtful way without considering the impact, then yes, he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. Even if he's set on not having kids, the way he said it and the ultimatum could be seen as irresponsible and disrespectful to her future choices. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
