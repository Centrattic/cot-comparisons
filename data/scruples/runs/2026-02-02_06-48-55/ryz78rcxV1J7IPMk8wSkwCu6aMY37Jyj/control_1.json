Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want them, and he doesn't want a child to ruin his life or cause financial strain. She's upset, thinking he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were talking about pregnancy, and he made a joke that upset her. Then he said flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. He loves her but can't handle kids. But is this his right to say? Or is it wrong because it puts pressure on her?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He might think he's being honest, but making such a definitive statement could be hurtful. Even if he's clear about his stance on kids, telling her he'd leave her if she got pregnant is a strong ultimatum. It could imply that he's not responsible if she gets pregnant, which might not be fair. Also, considering that they're in a committed relationship, making such a threat might be seen as a lack of commitment to her and their future together. \n\nAnother angle: consent and responsibility. If they're having unprotected sex, there's a risk of pregnancy. He's putting the onus on her not to get pregnant, but maybe he should be part of the solution. If she's not ready for kids, maybe they should both use contraception. But if he's so adamant about leaving if she does get pregnant, that could be seen as shifting responsibility onto her, which isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's upset about his loyalty and his view on women and responsibilities might be because he's treating her as someone who might betray him by getting pregnant, which she didn't want in the first place. He's saying he can't trust her to avoid getting pregnant, even though she's stated she doesn't want kids soon. That might not be fair, as it implies he doesn't believe her commitment to their shared plan.\n\nBut then, he's being upfront about his own limits. If he can't handle a child, maybe it's better to say so. However, the way he's phrased it as an ultimatum could be the problem. Instead of a direct threat, maybe discussing and planning together would be better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners need to agree on having kids. If she's okay with not having them but he's against it, that's compatible. But if she gets pregnant and they don't plan to, then they have to deal with it. By saying he'd leave, he's not leaving room for discussion or support, which is a problem. Also, it might be unrealistic to expect her to never get pregnant, which is a natural biological possibility. \n\nSo, putting it all together, he's being honest about his feelings, but the way he's handling it is dismissive and possibly disrespectful. It's not just about his own preferences but how he's responding to her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not considering her perspective and the potential consequences of his ultimatum. The answer is A.\n"
