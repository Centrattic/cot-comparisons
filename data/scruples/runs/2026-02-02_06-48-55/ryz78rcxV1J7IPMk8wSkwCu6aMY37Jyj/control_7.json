Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The situation is complex, so I need to unpack it carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points from the author's perspective: He loves her but can't stand children and doesn't want to be responsible financially. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he clarified he'd leave if she got pregnant, whether by birth control or not. The girlfriend is hurt, feeling he's not loyal and has poor views on women and responsibilities.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author is upfront about his stance on children. But bringing up the topic in a conversation where the girlfriend isn't pregnant and has indicated she doesn't want kids soon might be problematic. Even if he's honest, the way he phrased it\u2014making a joke that upset her and then being blunt\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her feelings or their future plans. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she didn't express wanting a child, but she's not against carrying one if it happened. The author's response is a strong ultimatum, which might not account for her possible feelings or the complexity of an actual pregnancy situation. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise, and this seems like a major decision that affects both partners. The author is making a unilateral decision that could end the relationship if she becomes pregnant, which she isn't even planning for. \n\nEthically, is it fair to base the continuation of a relationship on a hypothetical scenario, especially when the partner isn't seeking pregnancy? The author's stance is about his personal values, but relationships often require flexibility. If he's certain about not wanting children, maybe it's better to discuss alternatives if a pregnancy occurs, rather than an immediate breakup. However, he's clear about his boundaries, which is his right. The problem might be in the communication and the reaction to her distress. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about financial responsibility and women's roles could be seen as contributing to the conflict. Even if unintended, his statement might come off as sexist if he's prioritizing his financial concerns over her and the child's well-being in a hypothetical scenario. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, being upfront about one's stance on children is generally advised. But the way he communicated it and the ultimatum could be seen as harsh. The girlfriend's upset reaction is valid because such a statement can feel like a threat to the relationship's future. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional impact of his statement and didn't engage in a constructive discussion. Even if his feelings about children are valid, the way he handled the conversation could be perceived as dismissive and lacking empathy. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to weigh this carefully.\n"
