Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The woman doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author made a joke, then after some back and forth, he told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want a child ruining his life. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibility.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. First, communication in relationships is key. Making a joke about not giving the baby away might have been the start. Then escalating to a serious ultimatum. Even though he says he loves her, the ultimatum about leaving over a potential pregnancy seems extreme. \n\nPregnancy is a big decision and it's a mutual responsibility. If the man is against having kids, that should be discussed before any situation arises. But just threatening to leave if she gets pregnant, regardless of birth control, might be seen as controlling. Also, considering that pregnancy can happen even with birth control, which isn't 100% effective. He's taking a stance that removes her agency in the situation, which could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction points out issues with loyalty and responsibility, which might be valid because he's prioritizing his own feelings over what she wants, especially since she said she wouldn't abort or give up a child.\n\nAlso, making a joke first, then a serious threat, that could be seen as flip-flopping and not taking her feelings into account. The key factors here are respect for her autonomy, communication about future family plans, and whether the threat of leaving is a reasonable or respectful response. Since they were discussing the topic, it's possible he didn't fully consider the implications of his statement or how it would affect her. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have mutual respect and discussion about such significant life decisions. His response seems to prioritize his own desires without room for compromise, which could make him the asshole here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation with the necessary communication and respect, and his ultimatum is harsh and controlling.\n"
