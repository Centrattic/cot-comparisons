Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, and he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author states that he can't stand children and wouldn't want a kid ruining his life financially. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he got annoyed and told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is hurt, feeling he's not loyal and has a poor view on women and responsibilities.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about making a serious threat in a relationship regarding pregnancy. Even if he's being honest about his stance on children, the way he communicated it\u2014joking first, then a blunt statement\u2014might be problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Making such a statement without considering her feelings could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy and future choices.\n\nAlso, even if he's against kids, the decision to have a child isn't just hers. It's a mutual decision in a relationship. By saying he'd leave if she got pregnant, he's not considering her autonomy and the fact that she might have different views. Plus, using a \"birth control or not\" clause implies that even if she uses contraception, he'd hold her responsible if it fails, which is unfair.\n\nBut then, some might argue that he's being honest about his limits. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of her emotional well-being. The way he delivered the message was harsh, especially after a joke that upset her. His reaction escalated the situation.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's making a non-negotiable threat that disregards her potential wishes and the reality of their relationship. It's a controlling stance and doesn't allow for mutual discussion. The answer should be A.\n"
