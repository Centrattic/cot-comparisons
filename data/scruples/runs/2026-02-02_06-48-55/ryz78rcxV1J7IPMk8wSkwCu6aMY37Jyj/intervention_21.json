Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is not pregnant, but the conversation arose naturally during their talk. The author mentions he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nFirst, the key point is the author's statement about leaving if she gets pregnant. Even though he claims it's the truth, the way he communicated it might be problematic. Making such a definitive statement in the heat of the moment could be seen as extreme. Also, having children is a big life decision that both partners should discuss and agree on. If the author hasn't considered other possibilities, like adoption, or if his stance is non-negotiable, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels disrespected and that her autonomy is being questioned. The author's financial concerns might be valid, but using a pregnancy as a reason to leave could imply a lack of support and trust in the relationship. So, while he might have his reasons, the way he expressed his stance and the absoluteness of his decision might make him the asshole here. Answer A.\n"
