Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his girlfriend that he would leave her if she got pregnant. I need to figure out if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, let me break down the scenario. The guy and his girlfriend were discussing pregnancy. She says she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. He makes a joke, and she gets upset. He then tells her flatly he'll leave her if she gets pregnant, birth control or not. He loves her but can't stand kids and doesn't want his life or finances ruined. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The guy is being very direct about his stance, but the way he communicates it is problematic. Making a joke that upsets her and then following up with a serious ultimatum shows a lack of sensitivity. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, the timing and manner matter. Relationships require discussion of such important issues when both are ready, not in the middle of a conversation where it's taken as a joke.\n\nAlso, by saying he'll leave her regardless of birth control, he's placing the entire burden on her, which might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and agency. It's a major life decision to have children, and both partners should have a say and work together to find a solution that respects both their wishes. His ultimatum doesn't seem to consider her perspective or the partnership aspect.\n\nMoreover, the fact that he's using this as a potential deal-breaker without discussing it thoroughly and respectfully could be seen as selfish. While his stance on not wanting kids is his personal choice, the way he's communicated it and the ultimatum he's given are not constructive. It's possible that there's a misunderstanding or a failure to communicate his long-term plans in a way that acknowledges their relationship's future.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy's approach is likely the problem here. He didn't handle the conversation with care, and his ultimatum is harsh and could be perceived as disrespectful. Even if his intent was to be honest, the method was flawed. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
