Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He says he doesn't want kids and can't stand the idea of having them. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's not loyal or has bad views on women and responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man made a joke initially, then got serious and told her he would leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is distressed because she doesn't want to give up the baby but doesn't want kids soon. The man's stance is non-negotiable\u2014no kids, so if she gets pregnant, he's out. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, this seems like a major issue. Communication is crucial in relationships, especially about having children. The man's response is pretty extreme because it's a big commitment. But making a blanket statement about leaving because of pregnancy, regardless of circumstances, might not be fair. What if she gets pregnant accidentally, or even if she wants to keep the baby but he's not ready? It's a mutual decision usually. By saying he'll leave no matter what, he's not considering her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the joke he made about not giving the baby away\u2014maybe that was the trigger for her. He then escalated it by being serious. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her potential autonomy and his commitment are at stake. The man's statement could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her feelings. \n\nBut then again, if the man truly can't have kids, that's a valid personal choice. However, the way he communicated it\u2014joking first, then being serious\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. The problem is that having a child is a shared responsibility. If one partner is against it, the other should consider that, but if the woman is against giving up the child, the man's reaction seems harsh. \n\nSo, the man might not be wrong in his personal choice, but the way he handled the situation is problematic. He didn't communicate his stance in a constructive way, leading to conflict. The key here is mutual respect and considering each other's needs. Since he's not open to negotiation and his response is to leave immediately, it's a deal-breaker for her. But is that his fault? Or is he just being honest about his non-negotiables?\n\nI think the issue is more about how he communicated it. If he had discussed it calmly and considered alternatives, maybe things would be different. But by making a joke first and then a firm statement, he might have been dismissive. Therefore, the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the communication properly and his response is not collaborative.\n"
