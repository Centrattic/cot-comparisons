Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. The user says they think the author is wrong but want to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states he can't stand children and wouldn't want a kid ruining his life or causing financial strain. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, then followed up with a serious statement that he'd leave if she got pregnant, birth control or not. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, respect, and the implications of such a statement. The author's reasoning is based on his personal dislike of children and financial concerns. But in a relationship, such a statement can be seen as a major ultimatum. Even if he's honest, the way he communicated it might be harsh. \n\nHe turned a joke into a non-negotiable threat, which could be hurtful. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected are valid because making such a conditional statement about staying in a relationship based on her potential pregnancy might imply a lack of trust or respect for her autonomy. Also, it's a significant commitment issue. \n\nHowever, the author claims he's being truthful and that he loves her but can't handle children. But relationships require compromise, and making a firm decision without considering her feelings or future possibilities could be problematic. Even if he's clear about his stance, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum nature might be the problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if both partners are using birth control properly, pregnancy isn't expected. But his statement removes any possibility of negotiation, which might not be fair. Also, implying that he can't handle responsibility by leaving if she's pregnant might come across as avoiding responsibility rather than taking it on together.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his response was an ultimatum without empathy or discussion. He didn't seem to consider her feelings or the potential consequences, making his statement hurtful and possibly a deal-breaker for her. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
