Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So the situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want to be financially burdened by a child. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has bad views on women and responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and mutual understanding in relationships. Having a child is a big decision that affects both partners. If one partner is completely against having kids and makes it clear that they would leave if the other becomes pregnant, that's a serious red flag for the other person. It might be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's making a joke initially, the fact that he later states it as a non-negotiable condition could be very stressful for her. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's using a threat as a joke first and then becomes serious might have crossed a line. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and responsibilities makes sense because she's being told that her choice to have a child, even if it's not planned, would result in the relationship ending. That could be seen as putting pressure on her to comply with his desires, even if she's not against having a child herself. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings towards children. But honesty doesn't excuse being controlling or making ultimatums that affect someone else's reproductive choices. The key here is whether his statement infringes on her rights and autonomy. In many relationships, both partners should have the right to make decisions about their bodies without coercion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's statement could be seen as wrong because he's making a non-negotiable demand that impacts her reproductive choices without mutual agreement. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
