She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand children and doesn't want them, and he's clear that if she becomes pregnant, he'll leave regardless of birth control. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which she took as a threat or serious, leading to her being upset. Then he escalated by being blunt about leaving if she gets pregnant. The main issue here is the author's stance on not wanting children and being unwilling to support a child, which he's communicated to her. But the problem is how he communicated it and the implications.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if both partners have different views on children, it's important to discuss and find a mutual understanding. The author states that he can't stand children and would never let a child ruin his life, which are personal beliefs. However, making a definitive statement like leaving if she gets pregnant is a major commitment and has serious consequences. It's possible that the girlfriend felt pressured or that her autonomy was disregarded, especially if she's not opposed to having children in the future.\n\nAlso, the fact that he said this in the heat of the moment after getting annoyed suggests that the communication wasn't done thoughtfully. Even if he's honest about his stance, the way he delivered it might have been hurtful and dismissive of her feelings. She might feel that he's not taking her wishes into account or that he's not considering her potential desire to have a child, even if she's not in a rush. The author's response could be seen as extreme and not giving her the respect of discussing possible solutions or compromises.\n\nAnother angle is about responsibility. The author is concerned about financial and life impacts of having a child, which is valid. However, in a relationship, both partners should be on the same page regarding major life decisions like having children. If the author isn't willing to consider any scenario where they have a child together, that's a significant red flag. It also raises questions about his support for her, especially if she wants to raise the child alone, which could be a burden.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction about not being loyal and having a bad view on women might stem from feeling that he's treating her as someone who might force him into a situation he's not ready for, or that he's not accepting her as she is. It's possible that she feels he's not being supportive of her potential choices, which is a key aspect of trust and partnership.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while personal choice is important, making an ultimatum like this can be seen as extreme. Relationships require negotiation and understanding of each other's boundaries. The author might be in the wrong because he's not allowing for any flexibility or discussion, and instead is imposing a non-negotiable condition that could end the relationship abruptly based on a situation that neither of them wants.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that being honest about one's deal-breakers is important in a relationship. If the author is clear from the start that having children is a deal-breaker, and she's aware of that, then he's not being inconsiderate. But the issue here is that the communication happened in a confrontational manner during an argument, not a calm discussion. That could have contributed to the misunderstanding and hurt feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's statement is a serious one with major consequences. The way it was communicated, especially in the heat of the moment, and the lack of consideration for her feelings and potential future decisions might place him in the wrong. It's about respecting each other's autonomy and finding a middle ground rather than making absolute statements that could end the relationship over a hypothetical situation.\n"
