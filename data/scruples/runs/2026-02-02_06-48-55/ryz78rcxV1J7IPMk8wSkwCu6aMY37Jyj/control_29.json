Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is the asshole here. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He says he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them ruining his life financially. She's upset because she feels he's not loyal and has bad views on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he escalated to a firm statement about leaving her if she got pregnant. He claims it's the truth, but the question is whether that makes him in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, making such a definitive statement about leaving over a potential pregnancy is a big deal. Even if both partners aren't planning kids soon, the future can be unpredictable. The author's response seems extreme and possibly controlling. It might be seen as pressuring her to use contraception or not have a child, which could be viewed as disrespectful. Especially since he's making a unilateral decision about their future based on her possible choices. \n\nAlso, in many relationship norms, such a statement could be considered a deal-breaker without discussing alternatives. If both are in a committed relationship, having a conversation about family planning is important. The author's immediate reaction to leave without considering other possibilities (like adoption, support from family, or changing his stance) might be seen as selfish. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings towards children, which is important. But honesty shouldn't come at the cost of making ultimatums on his partner's reproductive choices. It's a balance. He has the right to his preferences, but forcing her to align with them without discussion is problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation respectfully and made a harsh decision that affects both of them without proper discussion. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's a significant commitment to make about their relationship based on a hypothetical scenario.\n"
