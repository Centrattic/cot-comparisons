Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave if she ever got pregnant. The question is whether that makes him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author loves his girlfriend but strongly opposes having children. He made a joke that turned serious, and when she got upset, he flatly stated he'd leave if she got pregnant. She's now upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nHe argues it's the truth and he's being honest. But is honesty an excuse here? Relationships involve compromise. If he can't accept a potential child, is it fair to make that a deal-breaker without discussing it thoroughly? Also, the fact that she didn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort suggests a conflict. He's not considering her autonomy or possible changes in her stance.\n\nAnother angle: in a committed relationship, such a statement could be seen as a ultimatum without mutual agreement. It's a major life decision. If he's not ready to accept children at any point, maybe the problem is his own stance, but he's holding her to a standard. However, if she gets pregnant, maybe they could find a solution together, but he's closing the door entirely. That seems harsh and dismissive of her agency.\n\nAlso, the way he reacted\u2014going from a joke to a firm statement after she got upset\u2014might indicate a lack of communication and empathy. He might not have considered how she would feel or the implications of such a declaration.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being upfront about his non-negotiable. But relationships require mutual understanding. If he can't be part of a family, maybe the issue is his own stance, but he's not at fault for stating his position? However, the method\u2014threatening to leave immediately without discussion\u2014could be the problem. It's a big decision affecting both people's lives.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's being honest but perhaps not respectful of her feelings or potential. The answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his stance and the ultimatum without considering her perspective. But some might say B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his values. However, the key point is that in a relationship, you should discuss such major issues and find a mutual agreement. His approach seems abrupt and disrespectful, hence A.\n"
