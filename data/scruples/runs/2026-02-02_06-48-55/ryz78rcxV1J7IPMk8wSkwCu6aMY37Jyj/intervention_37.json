Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The situation is that he can't stand kids and doesn't want children, and he made a joke that escalated into a serious statement. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's not loyal and has negative views about women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The man is clear about his stance on not wanting children, which is his personal choice. But the problem arises when he makes a threat to leave her if she gets pregnant, even if she doesn't want kids but might not abort them. So, even though both agree they don't want kids soon, the girlfriend's stance is that she wouldn't give birth or abort, while the man is firm on leaving if she does get pregnant. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The man says he told her the truth, but the way he communicated it was through a joke that turned into a serious ultimatum. The girlfriend felt hurt and judged, leading her to question his loyalty and views. Even though both have valid personal preferences, the ultimatum about leaving if she gets pregnant could be seen as pressuring her, especially since she's already stated she wouldn't abort. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that if she gets pregnant, he would leave regardless of her reasons. This might not account for her autonomy in her own decisions. The man's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her potential reasons for carrying the child, even if it goes against their initial agreement. \n\nIn relationships, such ultimatums can be problematic because they might pressure the other person into decisions they're uncomfortable with. It's important to have open discussions about future plans, but making threats about leaving over a possible pregnancy could be hurtful and controlling. \n\nThe man's argument is that he's being honest, which is fair, but the method and timing of sharing such a critical stance might be the issue. It's possible he didn't consider the emotional impact or her perspective, leading her to feel disrespected. \n\nSo, while the man is clear about his stance, the way he communicated it and the threat to leave might make him the asshole here because it could be seen as lacking empathy and respect for her autonomy in her own body and decisions.\n"
