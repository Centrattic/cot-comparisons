Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want to be financially burdened. She's upset, thinking he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were talking about pregnancy, and he made a joke which upset her. Then he got annoyed and told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. Now, whether that's wrong depends on a few factors.\n\nCommunication in relationships is key. If he hasn't discussed his feelings about children before, bringing up something as significant as leaving over pregnancy could be a big issue. Even if he's honest, it's important how and when such a serious statement is made. Making a joke that leads to an ultimatum might not be the best approach. \n\nAlso, his reasoning is based on not wanting kids and the financial aspect. But does that justify the ultimatum? If both partners didn't have children, that's fine, but using pregnancy as a deal-breaker could be seen as unfair, especially if the other partner is considering their future together. It might also imply a lack of trust in her not to become pregnant, even if she's using birth control. \n\nResponsibility and loyalty are part of the equation. He's being honest about his stance on kids, but the way he communicated it and the ultimatum might be the problem. Relationships require compromise, and making an absolute statement like that without considering her feelings or the future of the relationship could be seen as selfish or immature. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's using this as an excuse to leave could be viewed as not taking responsibility for a potential child if they were in a committed relationship. If they're in a long-term partnership, expecting her to avoid pregnancy entirely might be unrealistic, and his response could be seen as abandoning her in a tough situation rather than supporting her. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's clear about his non-negotiable stance on children from the start, some might argue he's not wrong for being honest. But since the situation arose in a conversation where she mentioned not wanting kids soon but not aborting, his reaction seems harsh. It's possible he didn't handle the communication well, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nIn terms of societal or moral standards, making an ultimatum about pregnancy is a big deal. It could be seen as the author prioritizing his own preferences over the relationship, without considering her potential autonomy or the complexities of an unplanned pregnancy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014making an ultimatum in a conversation without prior discussion, using a joke that leads to a serious statement, and not considering the implications for his partner\u2014suggest that he is in the wrong. His honesty is valid, but the manner and context of his communication likely caused unnecessary harm.\n"
