Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend they would leave her if she ever got pregnant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they made a joke about the girlfriend not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then, under some pushing (maybe she pressed him for a serious answer?), he stated outright that he would leave if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He loves her but can't stand kids and doesn't want a child to affect his life financially or otherwise.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a poor view of women and responsibility. The author argues that he's just being honest. The key here is whether his response to the situation is acceptable or not.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, agreeing to leave someone if they conceive is a major issue. Even if he has strong personal feelings against children, making such a definitive statement can be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. The girlfriend's position is that she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give them up. His reaction might be dismissing her potential future choices or not considering her wishes.\n\nAlso, in a committed relationship, such a decision affects both partners. If one person is unwilling to consider any possibility of children, the other should be aware. However, making it a deal-breaker without considering the other's stance could be seen as inflexible. The author's blunt statement might have been harsh, especially as a joke turned into a serious threat.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author is being honest about his non-negotiables. If both partners can't agree on having children, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, bringing it up in the context of a joke and then making a serious ultimatum might not be the right approach. The girlfriend felt disrespected, which is a significant point.\n\nLegally and ethically, it's about mutual consent and respect. The author's stance is personal, but enforcing it as an absolute condition without mutual discussion might be problematic. Relationships require compromise, and this seems like a fundamental issue where the author is not allowing for any middle ground.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the way he communicated them and the ultimatum he gave might be seen as the wrong approach. The girlfriend has a right to autonomy over her body, and his statement could be viewed as controlling or disrespectful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
