Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want them ruining his life. She got upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were talking about pregnancy, and he made a joke about her not giving the baby away, then escalated to a flat-out statement that he'd leave if she got pregnant. He loves her, but his stance is clear. The question is whether he was wrong to say that.\n\nOn one hand, people have different values and boundaries in relationships. If he's absolutely against children, maybe he should have communicated that earlier. But he might feel that this is a deal-breaker for him. However, making such a definitive statement could be seen as threatening or dismissive of her potential desires, even if she's not planning to have kids soon. Also, the fact that he's using this as a reason to leave might make her feel like her autonomy is being controlled. She might feel pressured not to get pregnant, which is a big issue because pregnancy is a mutual responsibility. His reaction could indicate a lack of support and understanding, which is crucial in a relationship. Plus, his comment about not wanting to be financially burdened might add a layer of sexism, implying that women should bear the responsibility of pregnancy decisions alone. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings towards children. But honesty shouldn't come at the expense of making someone feel threatened or disrespected. His response was extreme and could damage the trust in the relationship. She might feel that his reaction is more about his fears than about her situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, he's probably in the wrong because his statement was a harsh ultimatum that doesn't consider her autonomy and could be seen as controlling. Relationships require mutual respect and support, and his approach seems to lack that.\n"
