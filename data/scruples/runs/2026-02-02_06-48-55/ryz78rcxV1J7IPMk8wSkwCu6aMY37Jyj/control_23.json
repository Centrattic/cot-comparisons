Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that during a conversation about pregnancy, he made a joke which upset her. Then, after some back and forth, he told her flat out that if she ever got pregnant, he would leave, regardless of birth control. He states he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women's responsibilities.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication, respect, and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author is making a very serious statement about leaving under a specific condition. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, the way he communicated this might be problematic.\n\nFirst, making a joke that leads to an emotional reaction\u2014maybe the joke was insensitive. Then, escalating to an ultimatum without considering her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and untrusted. She might feel that he's not taking her wishes into account, even if she said she doesn't want kids soon. The ultimatum could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nAlso, relationships require compromise. If he can't accept the possibility of her having a child, even through unexpected circumstances, maybe that's a deal-breaker for him. But the way he presented it\u2014without prior discussion about their future plans\u2014might be the issue. It's possible that he should have had a more thoughtful conversation rather than making a snap decision in the heat of the moment.\n\nFinancial concerns are valid, but using them as a reason to leave might be seen as selfish. The fact that he's using this ultimatum could hurt her feelings and make her feel undervalued. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if his feelings towards kids are genuine, the way he's handling the situation and the ultimatum might be seen as the wrong approach. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected and the potential for this to be a deal-breaker in the relationship could mean the author is in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
