Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The author says he can't stand kids and doesn't want them, so he made a joke first, then when she got upset, he clarified that he would leave if she became pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal or respectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if making such a statement is justifiable. Relationships usually require mutual respect and consideration. Even if the author has strong feelings against children, it's a significant issue to address. Bringing up such a definitive statement, especially in a joking manner followed by a serious ultimatum, might not be respectful. It's important to communicate about future plans, but doing so in a way that's dismissive of the other person's feelings is problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction shows she felt hurt and disrespected. The author's response of being \"out\" if she gets pregnant could be seen as putting pressure on her to avoid pregnancy, regardless of her own wishes. Even though she doesn't want kids soon, the fact that she wouldn't abort or give them away suggests she's considering the possibility of having children in the future. The author's refusal to be part of a child's life might conflict with her potential desires, which she hasn't expressed yet.\n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014starting with a joke and then a blunt statement\u2014could be seen as not taking her feelings into account. Healthy communication involves discussing such topics openly and respectfully, not making ultimatums that force the other person into a decision. The author's stance might be about his own preferences, but it's a major life decision that affects both parties. He might not be in the wrong for having his own views, but how he communicated and enforced them could be the issue here.\n\nSo considering all factors, the author's approach is likely hurtful and disrespectful, making him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
