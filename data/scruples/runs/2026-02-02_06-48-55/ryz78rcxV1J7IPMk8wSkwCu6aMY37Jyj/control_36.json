Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she gets pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want a child to ruin his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, thinks he's not loyal and has a bad view of women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The question is whether his statement was wrong. He made a joke first, which upset her. Then he escalated by saying he'd leave her if she got pregnant. Even though they were talking about hypothetical scenarios, the girlfriend is now hurt and angry. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect in a relationship. Making such a definitive statement about leaving over a potential future event that's not within her control (like getting pregnant, even if she's on birth control) can be seen as threatening or controlling. It's important to consider how that affects the other person's sense of security and trust. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's making her feel like she's not trusted, or that her choices regarding pregnancy (even if she doesn't want kids) could lead to the end of the relationship. Even if he's honest, the way he communicated it might be harsh. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that he's making about her. If she's not planning to get pregnant, but if she does, he's pulling out. It's possible she feels pressured or that her autonomy is being questioned. \n\nBut there's also his personal feelings about kids. He doesn't want children, which is valid. However, the way he's handling the situation might not be the healthiest. Instead of a direct threat, discussing boundaries and ensuring mutual understanding could be better. \n\nIn terms of loyalty and responsibility, he argues he's being truthful. However, the reaction from her is valid too. Trust is a big part of relationships, and such a statement might break that. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because he made a conditional statement that could harm the relationship and disregarded her feelings. So answer A.\n"
