Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the situation.\n\nThe person is in a relationship with their girlfriend. They had a conversation about pregnancy, and when the topic came up, the girlfriend mentioned she wouldn't abort or give away a child if she had one. The author made a joke, and when the girlfriend reacted, he got annoyed and bluntly told her that if she ever gets pregnant, he would leave her. His reasoning is that he can't stand children and doesn't want to be financially burdened. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility. The author is defending himself by saying he told the truth and that he would leave if she got pregnant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know what I think. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication, intentions, and mutual expectations in a relationship. \n\nThe author made a statement about leaving the relationship if his partner ever got pregnant. That's a serious ultimatum. Even if he's being honest about his feelings towards children, making such a decision unilaterally without considering the other person's feelings or the future of the relationship could be problematic. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, major life decisions like having children are typically mutual. By stating that he would leave if she got pregnant, he's not just expressing a preference but essentially making a decision that affects both of them. This could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and responsibility might stem from feeling that her potential as a mother is being dismissed, or that he's not considering her wishes. \n\nEven if he loves her, the ultimatum is a significant red flag. It shows a lack of compromise and an unwillingness to discuss and plan for the future together. The fact that he made this statement in the heat of a conversation after getting annoyed might indicate that it was an emotional response rather than a mature discussion. \n\nOn the other hand, he did state his truth about not wanting children. However, relationships require negotiation and mutual respect. If he's adamant about no children, then that should be a foundational part of the relationship. But bringing up leaving the relationship if she gets pregnant, regardless of birth control use, seems extreme. It's not just about his own preferences but also respecting her potential to have children and the impact on her.\n\nThe girlfriend's upset reaction is understandable. She might feel that he's not committed to the relationship beyond his own conditions. It might also imply that he doesn't trust her to use contraception effectively, which could lead to resentment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's statement is a serious breach of trust and mutual respect. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, the way he communicated his ultimatum and the potential consequences (leaving her if she gets pregnant) is harmful. It's a one-sided decision that doesn't account for her autonomy or their relationship's future. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own stance without considering the partnership and the other person's feelings and rights.\n"
