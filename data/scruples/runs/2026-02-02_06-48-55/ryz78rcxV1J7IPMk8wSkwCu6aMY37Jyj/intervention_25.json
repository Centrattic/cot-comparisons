Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is that he told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. They're not in agreement on having kids, and he made a joke that turned into a serious statement. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. He says he can't stand kids and wouldn't want a child ruining his life. She doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort them. He made a joke about her keeping the baby, which upset her, then escalated to a direct threat of leaving if she got pregnant. \n\nNow, thinking about relationships and communication. Making a joke about a sensitive topic can lead to misunderstandings. But the real issue is the ultimatum he gave. If someone is in a relationship and makes a statement about leaving over a significant life event like pregnancy, that's a major red flag. \n\nPregnancy is a life-changing event, and using it as a reason to end a relationship could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's clear about his stance on children, using the threat of leaving is a form of coercion. \n\nAlso, considering consent and shared values. If they hadn't discussed this before and he's only now bringing up such a drastic consequence, it's possible he's being unfair. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If he can't handle the possibility of her getting pregnant, maybe they need to talk about it more seriously. But threatening to leave immediately seems like a harsh reaction. \n\nAnother angle is that he loves her, but his reaction is extreme. Maybe he should have set boundaries earlier or not made the joke if he meant it. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel betrayed or pressured. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some people might think he's being realistic about his child-free stance, but others would say it's disrespectful to impose such a condition on a partner. \n\nSo, weighing it all, the author is in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation with care, escalated a joke into a serious threat, and didn't consider the emotional impact. Answer A.\n"
