Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. First, I need to understand the context. The author mentions he can't stand children and doesn't want any. He made a joke that upset her, then became serious about leaving if she gets pregnant. She's upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a poor view of women and responsibilities.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication, respect, and future planning in a relationship. Making a joke about not giving a baby away might not be the best approach. But the main issue is the statement about leaving if she gets pregnant. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards kids, using ultimatums in a relationship can be damaging. \n\nHe loves her but sets a condition that if she becomes pregnant, he'll leave. That's a significant decision that affects both of their lives. It's possible he's being upfront, but the way he communicated it might be harsh. She might feel pressured or not respected in her autonomy. Also, considering that she's not pregnant and the conversation was about future possibilities, his reaction could be seen as insensitive or not taking her feelings into account.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important too. She's upset about loyalty and views on women. Maybe she feels disrespected, thinking he's not committed to supporting her in any situation. Even if he's being truthful, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. His stance might be seen as selfish if he's not open to discussing alternatives or compromises. \n\nBut wait, he says he can't stand children and doesn't want them. That's a personal choice. If she's open to having kids but he isn't, there's a conflict. However, stating that he'll leave her if she gets pregnant is a definitive decision without considering her perspective or possible solutions. Maybe he should have approached the conversation more thoughtfully, ensuring they're on the same page about future family planning.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he's worried about financial impact, they could discuss practical solutions together. But his ultimatum doesn't leave room for discussion, which might be why she feels he's not taking responsibility seriously. Also, his comment about not letting a kid ruin his life could be seen as dismissive of her potential desire for children or the challenges she might face.\n\nSo, putting it all together: he's being honest about his feelings but in a way that's hurtful and possibly disrespectful. Relationships require negotiation, and his response might be too rigid, not considering her feelings or their mutual future. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong because of the harsh ultimatum and the way he communicated his stance.\n"
