Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. The main points here are about communication, responsibility, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the guy says he can't stand children and wouldn't want to be financially burdened by them. He made a joke that turned into a serious statement. The girlfriend was upset, feeling that his reaction shows a negative view on women and responsibilities. \n\nNow, in relationships, trust and communication are key. Making such a definitive statement about leaving over a potential pregnancy is a big deal. Even if he's being honest, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. The fact that she's upset about his lack of loyalty and his views on responsibilities suggests that this is a serious issue between them. \n\nThe guy claims he loves her but is setting a condition that's about not wanting children. That's a personal choice, but in a committed relationship, such a decision should involve mutual agreement. If he's not on board with having kids, he should have discussed this earlier to find common ground. However, making a unilateral decision to leave if she gets pregnant, regardless of circumstances, seems extreme. It could be seen as treating her as someone who might drag him into a situation he's not prepared for, which might come off as disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response is also important. She might feel that this is a significant betrayal of trust and commitment. Even if he's being honest, the way he presented it\u2014announcing he'd leave\u2014could be seen as emotionally abusive or dismissive of her potential autonomy. The fact that she's not pregnant doesn't change the fact that the statement was about a future scenario that could happen against their wills. \n\nThere's also the aspect of responsibility. By saying he'd leave if she gets pregnant, he's placing the burden of preventing pregnancy entirely on her, which could imply a lack of respect for shared responsibility in the relationship. Even if they both agree not to have kids, the reaction to an unexpected pregnancy (if it ever happens) needs to be a shared decision. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while it's true that people have different views on children, being in a relationship where one partner is willing to walk away under such a condition might be seen as selfish. The guy's argument about financial burden is a personal choice, but it's a major life decision, and making it non-negotiable without considering her perspective could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the man's statement, while honest, is likely harmful and disrespectful. It's a significant red flag in a relationship, and even if he's being truthful, the way he communicated it and the implications of his statement could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
