Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend they would leave her if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states they don't want kids and can't stand children. They made a joke that upset the girlfriend, then escalated by saying they would leave if she ever got pregnant, regardless of birth control. The girlfriend is hurt, feeling the author is not loyal and has a negative view of women's responsibilities.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship norms and expectations. Generally, making a serious threat about leaving over a potential pregnancy is a big deal. Even if the author is honest about their stance on children, the way they communicated it\u2014making a joke first and then a flat statement\u2014might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, considering consent and future planning in a relationship. Both partners should discuss and agree on major life decisions like having children. The author's ultimatum could be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy. She mentioned she doesn't want kids yet but wouldn't abort, so the author's threat undermines her agency.\n\nFinancial concerns are mentioned, but that's a personal value. However, using that as a justification for leaving might be seen as prioritizing personal desires over the relationship. The girlfriend's feelings of being disloyal and judged about responsibility suggest that the author's statement caused emotional harm without adequate discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims honesty. They might believe they're being truthful about their non-negotiables. But the method of communication here\u2014threatening to leave without mutual discussion\u2014is problematic. Healthy relationships require open dialogue, not ultimatums based on hypotheticals.\n\nSo, weighing it all, the author's actions, while possibly rooted in honesty, were communicated in a way that's hurtful and dismissive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
