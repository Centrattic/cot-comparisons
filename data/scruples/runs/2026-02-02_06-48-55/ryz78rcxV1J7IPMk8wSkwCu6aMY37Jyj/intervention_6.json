Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want them ruining his life. The girl is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities. \n\nHmm, so the key points here. The author made a joke first, then turned it into a serious ultimatum. Even though he loves her, he's setting a condition that if she becomes pregnant, he leaves. The problem here is that pregnancy is a significant decision, and making such a threat could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. \n\nHe mentions that she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give away a child. So she's considering that if she does get pregnant, she'd keep it. The author's response is to break up, which might not consider her autonomy. Also, using financial concerns as a reason could imply that he's not willing to take responsibility if they wanted to have children together, but he's not taking her feelings into account here.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Making a joke that turns into a serious threat without discussing the mutual future might be crossing a line. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, threatening to leave her over a potential pregnancy that's not her fault (since both are involved in contraceptive decisions) might be seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's not considering that they might choose to have a child together in the future if both agree, but his stance is absolute. It's possible he's not respecting her choices as much as her own. So, yeah, he's probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
