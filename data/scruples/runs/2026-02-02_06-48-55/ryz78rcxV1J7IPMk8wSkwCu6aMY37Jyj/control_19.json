Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend that he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. The key points here are his stance on children, the context of the conversation, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them. That's his personal preference, which is valid. But the issue arises when he makes a definitive statement about leaving her if she becomes pregnant. The girlfriend didn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author's response was a joke that turned into a serious ultimatum. \n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is crucial. The author's blunt statement could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy. Even if he's clear about his stance, making such a definitive threat about leaving might be seen as pressuring her or not respecting her potential future decisions. However, relationships are personal, so there's a counterpoint where he's being honest about his non-negotiables.\n\nBut here's the thing: in most relationships, major life decisions like having children are mutual. By saying he would leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of her choice, he's taking away her agency. That could be seen as controlling. Even if he's upfront, the way he phrased it might cross a line. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and views on women and responsibility might stem from feeling that her choices are not respected. \n\nAlso, the initial joke that led to the serious ultimatum might have been a bad approach. It's possible she felt caught off guard and then pressured. The author might not have considered how such a statement affects her emotionally. Even if he's truthful, the method of communication and the ultimatum itself could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while personal choices are important, making a relationship conditional on a partner not having a child they choose to keep can be seen as a deal-breaker. It's a big ask and might indicate that the author isn't prepared to handle a situation where his partner's autonomy conflicts with his own preferences. \n\nSo weighing these factors, the author's statement, while honest about his feelings towards children, might be in the wrong because it imposes his preferences on her in a way that disregards her autonomy and could be seen as manipulative or controlling. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
