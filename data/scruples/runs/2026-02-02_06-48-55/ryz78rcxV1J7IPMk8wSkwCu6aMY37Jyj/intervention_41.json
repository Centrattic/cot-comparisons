Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who told his girlfriend he would leave her if she gets pregnant. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy loves his girlfriend, but he can't stand kids. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, he'll leave her. The girlfriend is now upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The guy's stance is clear: he doesn't want kids and can't handle the financial or lifestyle changes. But by making that a deal-breaker, especially if she's not using birth control properly, he's putting a lot of pressure on her. Even if he's honest, it's a serious ultimatum. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that he's not considering her autonomy. She said she wouldn't abort or give away a child, so maybe she's thinking about having kids in the future. His reaction could be seen as dismissing her potential choices. Also, making a joke about her not giving the baby away might have been a trigger for her, leading to the argument.\n\nBut wait, he did say he loves her. However, his priority is avoiding children at all costs. It's important in a relationship to discuss such big issues. If they haven't had a serious talk about having kids, his response might be a red flag. Even if he's honest, the way he communicated it\u2014especially as a threat\u2014could be hurtful and controlling.\n\nAnother angle: pregnancy can happen despite birth control, so his statement might be unrealistic. He's essentially saying that if an accident happens, he'll leave, which could put the burden on her. That might not be fair. Also, by not discussing alternatives like adoption or other solutions, he's not showing flexibility.\n\nBut some might argue that people have the right to set boundaries in relationships. If children are a deal-breaker, it's better to know early. However, the method of communication here seems harsh and not considerate of her feelings. The initial joke leading to a serious ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while personal choice is respected, using pregnancy as a reason to end a relationship can be seen as irresponsible. It might indicate a lack of commitment beyond the relationship itself. Also, the girlfriend's reaction about his view on women suggests she feels he's placing a condition that's unfair to her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is being honest about his feelings towards kids, but the way he expressed it and the ultimatum itself could be harmful. The key is whether the response is proportionate and considerate. Since he's making a significant life decision based on a possible future event he can't control, and it's a non-negotiable, that's problematic. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
