Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The key points here are the context and the implications of his statement.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he doesn't like kids and wouldn't want a child to affect his life financially. But the issue is that he made a conditional statement about leaving her if she becomes pregnant. Even though he claims it's a joke, when she got upset and he clarified it, that shows a lack of sensitivity.\n\nNow, considering relationships, trust is crucial. Making such a statement can be seen as a betrayal of trust and commitment. Marriage or long-term relationships require mutual support and understanding. If one partner is so certain about leaving over an unplanned pregnancy, that raises red flags. It's about respecting each other's choices and working through challenges together, not using them as an ultimatum.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She feels disrespected and that the author has a negative view towards women's roles in parenthood. Even if the author's stance is about his own preferences, framing it as an ultimatum without considering her feelings is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he's honest about his stance on children. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of the partner's well-being or without considering the relationship's dynamics. The way he communicated his stance was harsh and conditional, which could be seen as a threat.\n\nIn terms of societal and ethical standards, relationships should foster support and understanding. Making a binding decision based on a possible future event (pregnancy) without prior discussion and mutual agreement is generally frowned upon. It's more about how such decisions are approached rather than the decision itself.\n\nSo, even though the author has his reasons, the way he expressed them and the ultimatum nature of the statement likely caused harm. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected and the potential for future conflict are significant factors. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
