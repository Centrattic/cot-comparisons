Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author states they can't stand children and would never want a kid, so they told their girlfriend that if she ever got pregnant, they'd leave her. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibility. The author says they love her but are just being truthful.\n\nNow, considering this from different angles. Legally, maybe not in the wrong, but ethically? Relationships require mutual respect and communication. Making a serious statement about leaving over a potential pregnancy is a big deal. Even if it's a joke, the girlfriend took it seriously. Also, discussing such a sensitive topic in a relationship requires care. The author's stance is about personal choice, but children are a major life decision that both partners should agree on. If they didn't discuss their future plans, including kids, before getting into a serious relationship, maybe they didn't have enough communication. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their feelings towards children. But the way they conveyed it\u2014threatening to leave\u2014might be harmful. Even if it's the truth, how it's communicated matters. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or that her autonomy was dismissed. Also, the author's financial concerns about kids might reflect a lack of empathy or consideration for shared responsibilities, though financial aspects are a real concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have a right to their feelings, but relationships need mutual understanding. The key issue is whether they should have made such a definitive, ultimatum-like statement. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be on the same page about major life decisions like having children. If the author hasn't discussed this thoroughly with their partner and instead reacts with an ultimatum, that could be seen as dismissive of her potential desires or the complexity of the situation. Therefore, the author's approach might be the problem, even if their feelings are genuine. So, I think the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because of the way they handled the situation and the lack of mutual discussion on such a significant topic.\n"
