Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant, even if she didn't want kids but wouldn't abort. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. He and his girlfriend were discussing pregnancy. She doesn't want kids soon but says she wouldn't abort or give one up. He made a joke, then when she got upset, he told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. He doesn't like kids and doesn't want a child to ruin his life or financially burden him. Now she's upset, accusing him of not being loyal and having bad views about women and responsibilities.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. Let's think about the implications. Making a serious statement about leaving someone over a pregnancy is a big deal. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, bringing up such a definitive ultimatum in the moment of conflict might be considered harsh.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. If he had concerns about wanting to avoid children, he should have discussed this with her earlier and found mutual understanding. By making a sudden, harsh statement during an argument, it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and her autonomy. Also, if she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort, his reaction might not consider her perspective or the complexity of her decision.\n\nMoreover, threatening to leave based on a potential pregnancy is a significant commitment and can cause emotional harm. It's possible that he didn't consider the emotional weight of such a statement or how it would affect their relationship. The fact that she's upset and feels he has a negative view of women and responsibilities suggests that his words might have been hurtful and could damage trust.\n\nHowever, he claims he's being honest about his stance on children. But honesty shouldn't be used as a shield for hurtful speech. There's a difference between expressing personal boundaries and making a conditional statement that could lead to the end of a relationship. Also, if they were in a committed relationship, such a decision should involve mutual agreement and planning, not a unilateral ultimatum.\n\nIn summary, while his feelings about not wanting children are his personal choice, the way he communicated his ultimatum during a conflict is likely the issue. It's important in relationships to respect each other's autonomy and work through differences. His reaction may have been too abrupt and not considerate of her feelings, leading to the conclusion that he is in the wrong.\n"
