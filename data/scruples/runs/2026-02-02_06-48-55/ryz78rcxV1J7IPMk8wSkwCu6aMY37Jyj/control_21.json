Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'd leave her if she gets pregnant. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author mentions he doesn't like kids and wouldn't let a child ruin his life financially. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he told her flat out he'd leave if she gets pregnant. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The author claims he's being honest about his stance on kids, but the way he communicated it might be an issue. Making a joke that upsets her and then delivering a harsh ultimatum could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and future plans. Even if he's honest, the method of expression matters. Relationships require considering each other's perspectives and values. If one partner is against children, that's a significant factor. However, telling someone you'll leave them if they become pregnant, regardless of birth control, might be seen as not respecting her autonomy. The fact that she's not okay with children right now but wouldn't abort or give them away suggests a potential conflict. The author's response could be seen as extreme and not working towards a solution. So, the question is whether his honesty justifies the harshness. I think the answer is A because the way he handled it is hurtful and doesn't consider her feelings or the complexity of the situation.\n"
