Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made the statement about leaving if their girlfriend gets pregnant is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's stance on children and the way they communicated their decision.\n\nFirst, the author states they can't stand children and never want to have any. That's their personal preference, which is valid. However, the way they communicated this is crucial. Making a joke that leads to an argument, then escalating to a definitive statement about leaving if there's a pregnancy introduces a serious threat. \n\nEven though the author claims they're honest and upfront, saying they would leave their partner if she gets pregnant, regardless of birth control, is a significant commitment issue. This could be seen as pressuring the partner to use contraception or avoid pregnancy, which might be unfair. The partner's feelings about not wanting kids soon but also not wanting to give them up complicates things. The author's response might be dismissive of her feelings and the potential complexities of an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nResponsibility and loyalty are also factors here. The author might see this as honesty, but the partner feels disloyal and that the author has a negative view of women and responsibilities. The threat to leave could be seen as a breach of trust and emotional support in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it's also important to consider the impact of such statements. The author's absolute stance without room for compromise might be considered harsh. Even if the author is clear about their boundaries, making a definitive statement like that without discussing alternatives or supporting each other's decisions could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, while the author has the right to their preferences, the way they expressed it and the ultimatum they gave could be viewed as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
