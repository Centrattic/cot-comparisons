Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant.\n\nFirst, the context: They were discussing kids. The girlfriend doesn't want them soon but wouldn't abort. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he told her flat out he'd leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He loves her but can't stand kids and doesn't want a child to ruin his life financially. She's upset, feeling it's about loyalty and views on women and responsibilities.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's statement is a definitive, non-negotiable response to a possible future scenario. Even if they were joking initially, the final statement is serious. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not valued. The author's stance is about personal choice, but relationships often require compromise.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't just express a preference but a threat. The girlfriend's unwillingness to have kids soon isn't the issue; the problem is the reaction. If he can't accept a child under any circumstances, that's a deal-breaker. But the way he communicated it\u2014joke leading to a harsh ultimatum\u2014might be the problem. It's not just about his personal beliefs but how he expressed them and the impact on the partner.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's upset stems from feeling her autonomy is dismissed. Even if he's against kids, the threat of leaving if she becomes pregnant might be seen as controlling or disrespectful. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's choices. By stating he'd leave, he's not respecting her potential choice to have a child, even if he disagrees.\n\nFinancial concerns are valid, but that's a separate issue. The ultimatum is more about the lack of acceptance of her possible decision. The author might believe he's being honest, but honesty needs to be paired with empathy. The girlfriend's feelings about loyalty and responsibility suggest she feels betrayed by his lack of commitment to support her, even in a challenging situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his reasons, the way he communicated and the ultimatum likely caused harm. The key is whether the approach was respectful and considerate. Since the girlfriend's reaction indicates emotional distress, the author is likely in the wrong for not handling the situation with care and for making a non-negotiable threat based on her potential future choices.\n"
