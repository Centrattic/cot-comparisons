Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. He says he doesn't like kids and doesn't want to be financially responsible for them. She's upset, thinking he's not loyal and has bad views on women and responsibilities.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider both sides. The guy's stance is that he doesn't want kids and would cut ties if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is hurt because he's making a condition that if she becomes pregnant, he'll leave. That's a big deal because pregnancy can happen even with birth control, and maybe they didn't plan for it. But the guy is being very direct and non-negotiable.\n\nNow, the key points here: communication, respect, and consequences. The guy made a joke first, which she took as an insult. Then when she got upset, he escalated by being blunt. Even though he claims he's being truthful, the way he communicated it might be the issue. Also, the fact that he's making a condition that's so drastic (leaving her) over a potential pregnancy, which she hasn't even had. \n\nI think the problem is that he's not considering her autonomy and her decision-making. If she's against abortions and giving up the child, but he's saying he'll leave if she gets pregnant, that's a conflict. He's controlling her reproductive choices, which is a serious ethical issue. Even if he doesn't want kids, he's imposing his will on her. Plus, making a threat to leave based on a possible future event that's beyond their control is problematic. \n\nAlso, the financial responsibility angle might not be the main issue here. The bigger problem is about mutual respect and consent in their relationship. They should have discussed their views on children before getting into a serious relationship. By not having that conversation, maybe both are at fault, but the guy's response is extreme and dismissive. So, I lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is making a non-negotiable demand that affects her life choices.\n"
