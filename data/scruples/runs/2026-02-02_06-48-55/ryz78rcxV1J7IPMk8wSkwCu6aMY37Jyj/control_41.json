Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He says he can't stand kids and doesn't want them ruining his life. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's not loyal and has a bad view of women. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man made a joke about not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he clarified that he would leave if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He loves her but hates kids. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, it's his right to be honest about his stance on children. If he can't handle having kids, it's important to communicate that. But on the other hand, making a definitive statement like leaving her if she gets pregnant could be seen as controlling or disrespectful, especially if it's a non-negotiable ultimatum. It's also possible that the joke he made first set the tone, but then he escalated to a serious threat. \n\nIn relationships, ultimatums can be problematic because they take away the other person's autonomy. If she's not pregnant yet, but he's saying he'll leave regardless of how it happens (birth control or not), that might imply he's not respecting her choices. However, he's being upfront about his deal-breaker. The problem is whether it's his right to impose that on her. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's using this as a reason to leave suggests that he hasn't considered other possibilities, like adoption or if she chooses to have the child without him. But he's clear he can't be part of that. It's a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people might judge him harshly for threatening to leave over a potential future event, especially since they're not even discussing a current pregnancy. But he's being honest about his non-negotiables. However, the way he communicated it\u2014first a joke, then an ultimatum\u2014might have been hurtful and abrupt. \n\nSo, the balance is between his right to set boundaries and her right to make her own reproductive choices. If they're in a healthy relationship, they should discuss such big issues beforehand. But by making an ultimatum without prior discussion, he might have overstepped. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not allowing her agency in the situation and is using a threat that could pressure her decisions.\n"
