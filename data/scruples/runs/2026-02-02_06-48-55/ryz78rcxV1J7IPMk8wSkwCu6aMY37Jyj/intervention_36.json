Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The key points here are the context, the reaction, and societal norms.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he can't stand children and wouldn't want a kid to ruin his life or cause financial strain. He made a joke initially, which upset her, and then escalated to a firm statement that he would leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical angle. In a relationship, both partners need to have mutual respect for each other's values and future plans. Having children is a significant life decision that affects both people. By making such a definitive statement, the author is imposing his personal stance on the relationship, potentially without considering her feelings and autonomy. Even if he's against kids, making an ultimatum like ending the relationship if she gets pregnant seems extreme. It's possible that the girlfriend might feel pressured into not pursuing motherhood, which could be seen as controlling or disrespectful of her choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that he's being honest and that he's not comfortable with children. Honesty in a relationship is important, but the way it's delivered matters. Making a joke that upsets her and then following up with a harsh ultimatum might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt betrayed or disrespected, which is a valid emotion when someone's future is discussed in such a definitive way without considering her perspective.\n\nSocietal views on this can vary, but generally, relationships require compromise. If the author is certain he doesn't want children, he and his partner should ideally align on this. However, the girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort a child. The author's response seems to dismiss her potential choice, especially if she were to change her mind or if a pregnancy were to happen involuntarily. This could lead to conflict and hurt feelings because it's a major decision affecting both parties.\n\nSo, while the author's honesty is understandable, the way he communicated his position and the ultimatum he gave could be seen as the wrong approach. The key issue here is whether the ultimatum is fair and considerate of her autonomy. Relationships thrive on mutual respect and communication, and by setting such a strict boundary without considering her feelings or future decisions, the author may be overstepping, leading to the conclusion that he is in the wrong.\n"
