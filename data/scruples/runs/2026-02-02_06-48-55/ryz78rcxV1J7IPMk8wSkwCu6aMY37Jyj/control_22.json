Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making a joke about leaving his girlfriend if she got pregnant. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he doesn't like children and wouldn't want to be financially responsible for a child. He made a joke about his girlfriend not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then, after some back and forth, he told her flat out that he would leave if she got pregnant. Now, she's upset and feels he's not loyal or has bad views on women and responsibility.\n\nLooking at relationships, communication is key. The author made a serious statement, even if it started as a joke. He should have considered how that might affect her feelings and their relationship. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a big issue. Even if he's honest about his feelings toward children, making such a definitive statement about ending the relationship if she becomes pregnant is a major red flag. It shows a lack of support and respect for her autonomy. Also, birth control is mentioned, but that's not foolproof, and assuming she's responsible enough to avoid pregnancy might be placing unfair expectations on her. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's choices and future plans is important. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her potential life choices. Even if he's clear about his stance on children, making a threat to leave based on a scenario that's not in her control (since birth control isn't 100% effective) is problematic. It's possible he's being honest, but the way he communicated it and the ultimatum are likely harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being upfront about his feelings. But relationships require compromise and mutual respect. If he's unwilling to consider any possibility of a child, that's a dealbreaker. However, how he expressed it\u2014threatening to leave\u2014could be seen as wrong because it's a harsh reaction that doesn't involve mutual discussion of future plans. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't approach the conversation with empathy, made a harsh ultimatum, and potentially disrespected his partner's autonomy and feelings.\n"
