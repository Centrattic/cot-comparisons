Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. He claims he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He made a joke about not giving the baby away, and she got upset. Then he escalated it by stating he'd leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He loves her but has a strong aversion to children. \n\nNow, thinking about relationships and communication. Making a definitive statement about leaving someone over a potential future event, which is pregnancy, is a big deal. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards kids, the way he communicated this might be hurtful. By saying he'd leave her, it can feel like he's not supporting her autonomy or their relationship's future. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's putting a condition on staying in the relationship based on her reproductive choices is problematic. It could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her desires. Even if he's not forcing her to get pregnant, by threatening to leave over it, he's making her choices a deal-breaker. That might not be fair because it's her body and her choice, and he's using the threat of leaving as a consequence for something that's beyond their immediate control.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his stance on kids. People have different values, and if having kids is a deal-breaker, it's important to communicate that. But doing so in a confrontational way without considering her feelings might be harmful. The key here is how the message was delivered and the impact it had.\n\nIn terms of loyalty and responsibility, his statement could be seen as not supportive. If a partner is concerned about financial aspects, maybe they could have discussed other solutions together rather than an ultimatum. His response might indicate a lack of willingness to work through challenges, which is part of a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though he's being honest about his feelings towards kids, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum he gave are likely hurtful and controlling. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
