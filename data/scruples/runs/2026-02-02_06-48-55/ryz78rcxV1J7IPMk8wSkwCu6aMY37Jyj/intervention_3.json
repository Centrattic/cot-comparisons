Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for telling their girlfriend that they would leave her if she got pregnant. The user mentions that they made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then, after getting annoyed, they told her flat out they'd leave if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. They explain that they don't like kids and can't stand the idea of their life being ruined financially or otherwise. The girlfriend is upset, accusing them of not being loyal and having bad views on women and responsibilities. The user says they love her but are just being honest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the user's reaction to the possibility of pregnancy. They made a joke that upset her, then followed up with an ultimatum. The girlfriend's response is about loyalty and views on women. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, making such a serious statement like leaving if she gets pregnant is a major red flag. It shows a lack of commitment to the relationship in the face of a potential life-changing event. Even if they don't want kids, the way they communicated it\u2014especially using a joke as a lead-in\u2014could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the fact that they're focusing on not wanting kids and being financially burdened might imply that they don't trust their partner's ability to use birth control, or that they see pregnancy as a personal failure rather than a shared responsibility. This could contribute to the accusations of having a negative view on women and their capabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is being upfront about their stance on children. If they had discussed this before, maybe it's a different scenario. But since the topic came up in a conversation where she's considering not aborting or giving away a child, the user's reaction might not align with her expectations for support. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but the manner and context matter. Telling someone you'll leave if they get pregnant without prior discussion or offering alternatives (like adoption or shared decision-making) can be seen as controlling or not taking their perspective into account. The girlfriend's upset reaction is understandable if she felt this was a betrayal or a lack of partnership.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user's actions likely hurt the girlfriend and could be seen as inconsiderate, even if their reasons are about personal preferences. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong here.\n"
