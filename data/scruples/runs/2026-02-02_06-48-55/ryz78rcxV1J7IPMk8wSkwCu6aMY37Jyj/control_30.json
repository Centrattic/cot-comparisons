Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He claims he can't stand kids and doesn't want a child affecting his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a joke initially, but then escalated to a serious statement that he would leave her if she became pregnant. The girlfriend didn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author's stance is clear: no children, and he can't handle the financial burden. \n\nNow, thinking about relationships and communication. Being honest about one's feelings is important, but the way it's communicated matters. The author's statement is a major red flag for a relationship. It's a conditional statement that withholds commitment based on a significant life event. Even if he's honest, making a definitive statement like \"I will leave you\" without room for discussion or compromise can be seen as disrespectful and controlling. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's feelings of not being loyal and the author's view on responsibilities and women's roles come into play. If she's open to having kids in the future and he's not, this could be a deal-breaker for her. But by saying he'll leave her if she gets pregnant, it's not just about his own feelings; it's imposing his will on her potential life choice. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a valid concern, but that's something they could discuss and plan for together. However, the author's response is to exit the relationship entirely rather than work through it. That might be his personal choice, but in a relationship, both partners need to be on the same page about major life decisions like having children. \n\nThere's also the aspect of making a joke about not giving the baby away, which might have been insensitive. Then escalating to a serious ultimatum could have been handled better with more empathy and understanding. The girlfriend's emotional reaction is understandable given the ultimatum.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, expecting a partner to avoid pregnancy without discussing alternatives (like adoption, or if they can both agree on not having kids) is a complex issue. The author isn't wrong in his personal stance, but in a relationship, such a definitive statement without mutual agreement is likely to be seen as inconsiderate and selfish. \n\nSo, while the author has a right to his opinion, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum he gave are problematic. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his partner's autonomy and future choices, and he's not considering the collaborative nature of a relationship."
