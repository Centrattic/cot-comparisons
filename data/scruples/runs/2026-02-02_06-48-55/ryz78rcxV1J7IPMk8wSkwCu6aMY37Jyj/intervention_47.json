Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The guy told his girlfriend that if she ever gets pregnant, he would leave her. He loves her but can't stand kids and doesn't want to be financially responsible for a child. The girlfriend is upset, saying he has a bad view of women and responsibilities.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a joke that upset his girlfriend, then escalated by stating he would leave her if she became pregnant. Even though he mentioned he loves her, his response seems pretty harsh. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not being loyal. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, making such a definitive statement about leaving someone over a potential future event like pregnancy is a big deal. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, bringing up such a serious ultimatum without considering her feelings or the relationship's future seems problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned she wouldn't abort a child if it happened suggests she's considering the responsibility. But the author is not open to that, so maybe they have conflicting values. However, how he communicated that\u2014joking and then being flat-out\u2014is not considerate. Relationships require communication and respect for each other's values. By stating he would leave immediately, he's not being supportive or compromising. \n\nThe girlfriend's anger about his view on women might be because he's implying that if she becomes pregnant, he can't handle it, which might make her feel like she can't rely on him in a serious situation. It's a sensitive topic, and his response was blunt. Even if he's honest, the way he delivered it might be the issue here. \n\nI think the key is whether making such a non-negotiable decision without discussing it properly is wrong. The author didn't seem to consider her feelings or the impact of his words. So I lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because he was harsh and didn't handle the situation with care, even if his feelings are genuine.\n"
