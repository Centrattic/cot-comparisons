Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. He mentions he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them, and he can't stand the idea of a child ruining his life or financial situation. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any partnership, especially when it comes to such a significant life decision as having children. He made a joke first about not giving the baby away, which she was upset about. Then he escalated by making a definitive statement that he'd leave if she got pregnant. \n\nNow, the question is whether his response was appropriate. He claims he's being honest about his feelings toward children. But in a committed relationship, both partners' needs and values should be considered. If he knew from the start that he doesn't want children, he should have discussed that early on. However, bringing up the possibility of leaving the relationship if she becomes pregnant is a major ultimatum. \n\nAnother angle is that she mentioned she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give them up. His reaction seems extreme because it's not just about his preferences but also about her autonomy. By threatening to leave if she gets pregnant, he's essentially taking away her choice in the matter, which can be seen as controlling. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions is part of his reasoning, but relationships should be built on mutual respect and support. Making such a statement might indicate a lack of commitment to working through issues together. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while personal preferences vary, making a decision to leave a partner solely because of an unintended pregnancy could be viewed as selfish. It's possible he's not considering her perspective or the possibility of other solutions, like adoption, which she already mentioned she's against. \n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that he's being honest about his non-negotiables. If he truly cannot accept having a child in any scenario, then he might feel it's necessary to set that boundary. But the way he communicated it\u2014joking first, then a serious ultimatum\u2014might not have been the best approach. \n\nIn conclusion, while he might believe he's being truthful, his response is harsh and could be seen as dismissing her feelings and reproductive autonomy. It's possible he's not in the wrong if the topic had been discussed and agreed upon earlier, but in this case, where he's making a sudden decision without considering alternatives, he's likely the asshole here.\n"
