      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. I need to figure out if he's in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was discussing pregnancy. The girlfriend says she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he got annoyed and told her he'd leave if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He clarifies he doesn't like kids and wouldn't want to be financially burdened by them. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal or has a bad view of women and responsibilities. He argues he's being truthful.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication, respect in relationships, and responsibilities. The author is making a very serious statement about leaving the relationship over a potential future pregnancy. Even though he loves her, he's setting a condition that if she becomes pregnant, he leaves. \n\nNow, in a healthy relationship, both partners should discuss their future plans, including having children. The problem here might be that this conversation came up in the middle of a discussion, perhaps not in a planned, respectful way. The author made a joke first, which upset her, then escalated to a firm statement. Using a pregnancy as a deal-breaker can be problematic because pregnancy can happen unexpectedly. It also raises questions about trust and commitment. If he can't be there for his partner in a situation like parenthood, even if it's not planned, that's a big issue.\n\nAlso, his reasoning about financial burden and not wanting kids might not be valid for him to use as a reason to leave the relationship. He's placing a condition that if she becomes pregnant, he walks away. That could be seen as unfair, especially if the pregnancy is not her fault or if it's a result of both their actions. It also shows a lack of support for her, which is a key aspect of a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Feeling that her partner would abandon her in a situation that could be life-changing might make her feel unsupported. His comment could be interpreted as not taking responsibility, which is a serious accusation. Even if he's being honest, the way he communicated it\u2014using an ultimatum\u2014might be damaging.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: if he's clear about his stance on children from the start, it's his right to set boundaries. But in this case, it seems like the conversation wasn't premeditated and came up during a discussion. The fact that he made a joke first before the ultimatum might have contributed to the tension. Also, the fact that he's using a pregnancy as a reason to leave might be seen as not taking responsibility for his own actions in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's not uncommon for couples to discuss having children. However, making a definitive statement to leave the relationship if a pregnancy occurs, even if it's against both their initial plans, could be seen as irresponsible. It's important for both partners to be on the same page about major life decisions. If they can't agree on having children, that's a key point to address. But using pregnancy as an automatic deal-breaker might not be fair, especially if it's an unexpected situation.\n\nAdditionally, his reasoning about financial burden and not wanting kids could be a personal choice, but in a relationship, both partners need to support each other. His reaction suggests he's not willing to support his partner in a significant way, which is a red flag. The girlfriend's feelings about loyalty and responsibility are valid; if he can't be there for her in a crisis like parenthood, that's a serious issue in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is making a very serious and potentially hurtful statement. Even if he's being honest about his feelings towards children, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum nature of his statement could be seen as the wrong approach. It's not just about his personal preferences but how they affect the relationship and the other person's needs and feelings. Therefore, he might be in the wrong here.\n"
