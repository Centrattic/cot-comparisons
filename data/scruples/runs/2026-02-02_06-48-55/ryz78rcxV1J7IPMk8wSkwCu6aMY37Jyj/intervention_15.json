Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy says he can't stand children and wouldn't want a kid. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he got annoyed and told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is now upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, relationship boundaries, and responsibility. The guy is being honest about his stance on children, which is a big part of a long-term relationship. However, the way he communicated it\u2014joking first, then getting annoyed and making a definitive statement\u2014might be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, having kids is a major decision. Both partners need to be on the same page. If he's certain he doesn't want kids, that's a valid stance, but bringing it up in a joking manner and then escalating when she gets upset could be seen as not respecting her feelings. She mentioned she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. So there's a mismatch in their future plans. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Did he overstep by making that ultimatum? If he's honest about his non-negotiables, maybe it's better to address it sooner rather than later. However, doing it in a situation where she's already upset and using a joking lead-up might not be the best approach. Also, the ultimatum itself could be seen as extreme, but if that's his firm stance, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, he should have approached the conversation more seriously from the start. Making a joke about it could trivialize her feelings. And the fact that he's not considering her perspective might be an issue. She might feel pressured or disrespected. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's being honest, which is important, but the method of communication and the ultimatum could be seen as harsh. However, if he's clear about his boundaries, even if it's difficult, it's not necessarily his fault. But the way he handled it might be the issue. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). In many cases, if someone is honest about their deal-breakers in a relationship, even if it's hurtful, they aren't in the wrong. However, the delivery matters. But given that he's upfront about not wanting kids, which is a significant factor, and he's choosing to end the relationship if there's a pregnancy, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have discussed this more thoughtfully. \n\nI think the answer is A. Because even though his stance is personal, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum could be seen as disrespectful. But others might say it's about honesty. However, considering the context, the fact that he's making a joke first and then being dismissive, maybe A is the right choice.\n"
