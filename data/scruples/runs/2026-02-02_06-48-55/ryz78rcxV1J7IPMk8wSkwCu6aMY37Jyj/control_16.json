Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying he would leave his girlfriend if she got pregnant. So, first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that he doesn't like kids and wouldn't want them to ruin his life or cause financial strain. He made a joke that escalated into a serious statement about leaving her if she got pregnant. His girlfriend is upset, feeling that he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Relationships require mutual understanding and commitment. By making such a definitive statement about leaving over pregnancy, the author is setting a non-negotiable boundary that's tied to a potential future event not directly related to the relationship's current state. Even if it was a joke turned serious, saying he would leave shows a lack of support for her possible choice to have a child. That could be seen as abandoning her in a significant life decision, which is a big deal.\n\nBut then, people have different life goals. If he's adamant about not having children, maybe having kids is a deal-breaker. However, the problem here is that the author is not considering that pregnancy can happen even with birth control, and he's using that as a reason to leave, which might not be fair. It's also important that they might not have discussed this issue thoroughly before. The author's response was abrupt and left her feeling disrespected. \n\nIn terms of loyalty and responsibility, the author's statement could be seen as irresponsible because he's putting a condition that could lead to abandoning a partner during a vulnerable time. On the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings towards children, which is his right. But making such a statement without prior serious discussion might be hasty.\n\nSo, the key points are: honesty in relationships is important, but the way it's communicated matters. The author's approach here was harsh and didn't consider the emotional impact. Even if his stance on children is valid, the method of expressing it and the consequences (leaving over pregnancy) might be seen as selfish or not supportive. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't communicate his expectations properly and made a binding decision that could hurt his partner. The answer is A.\n"
