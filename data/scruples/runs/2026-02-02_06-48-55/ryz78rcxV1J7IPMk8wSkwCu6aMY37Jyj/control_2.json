Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. First, I need to consider the context. The author mentions he doesn't like kids, can't stand them, and doesn't want a kid to ruin his life or financial situation. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one away if she had it. The author made a joke, then later told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant.\n\nNow, the key points here. Communication is a big factor. The author states he's clear about his stance on children, but maybe he didn't communicate it effectively. The girlfriend might feel that the threat of leaving is a harsh reaction, especially since she's already stated she wouldn't abort or give up a child. The author's response seems extreme\u2014leaving the relationship if she gets pregnant, regardless of birth control. \n\nAnother angle is the use of a joke first. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which could have been a red flag. Then escalating to a direct threat might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is about loyalty and views on women and responsibilities. If the author values not having kids so much that he can't handle a pregnancy, maybe he should have communicated that earlier rather than making an ultimatum in the moment.\n\nAlso, relationships require mutual understanding and respect. The author might believe he's being honest, but the method and timing could be problematic. The girlfriend's upset is valid because such a statement can feel like a betrayal of trust or a lack of commitment beyond just a personal choice. \n\nFinancial concerns are a practical aspect, but they shouldn't override emotional and relational considerations. The author's stance might be seen as putting his own interests above the relationship. However, personal boundaries are important too. The line is whether the author's reaction is a legitimate boundary or an overreaction.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise. If the author can't accept the possibility of a child, maybe the issue is deeper than just pregnancy\u2014it's about his fundamental stance on children. The girlfriend might feel that his response invalidates her potential choices. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's statement is a strong ultimatum that could be seen as disrespectful or controlling, even if it's based on personal convictions. The way he communicated it\u2014after a joke and with an abrupt threat\u2014might make him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
