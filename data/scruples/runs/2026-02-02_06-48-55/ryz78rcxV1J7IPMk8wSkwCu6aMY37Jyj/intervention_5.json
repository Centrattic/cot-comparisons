Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but says she wouldn't abort or give away a child. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he said he would leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. The author has strong feelings against children, which is his personal choice, but relationships often require compromise. By making such a definitive statement about leaving if she becomes pregnant, he's imposing his preferences on her and making a decision that affects both of them without her consent.\n\nEven though he claims to love her, his response is extreme and could be seen as controlling or manipulative. The girlfriend's upset reaction is valid because pregnancy is a significant life event, and his reaction might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful of her autonomy. The fact that he's okay with her not wanting kids but would leave if she does seems inconsistent and unfair, given that relationships require mutual decision-making on such important matters.\n\nAlso, the statement about leaving if she gets pregnant, regardless of birth control, shows a lack of willingness to communicate and plan. It's not just about his dislike of children but how he's handling the situation. Healthy relationships involve discussing future plans, including children, and making decisions together. By making a unilateral decision to leave, he's not engaging in that partnership.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong here. The answer would be A.\n"
