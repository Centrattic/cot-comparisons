Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their girlfriend they would leave her if she ever got pregnant. They mention they can't stand children and don't want to be financially burdened by them. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of making such a statement in a relationship. Making a joke about not giving the baby away might have been a trigger, but then escalating to a flat-out statement that he would leave her if she got pregnant seems serious. Even if he loves her, such a declaration could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy. It's important to think about how this affects their relationship and mutual trust.\n\nNext, the fact that he can't stand children is personal, but in a relationship, especially when discussing future possibilities, such a strong reaction might indicate a lack of respect for her potential choices. Even if he's against kids, threatening to leave her before a pregnancy is a reality could be seen as irresponsible and disrespectful. Relationships require compromise and communication, and this seems like a one-sided ultimatum without considering her feelings or the complexities of such a situation.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response about loyalty and stereotypes is valid. Making such a statement can imply that a pregnancy would be entirely her responsibility, which might reflect a traditional or unfair view of gender roles. It's possible he's not taking into account that she might seek support or that they could discuss options together before making a decision.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings towards children. But honesty shouldn't be used as a shield to avoid empathy. The way he communicated his stance\u2014using a joke to trigger her and then an ultimatum\u2014might be the issue. Maybe he should have approached the conversation more sensitively, ensuring they both understand each other's boundaries and discussing how they would handle such a situation together.\n\nIn summary, while it's his right to not want children, the manner in which he expressed his decision, especially the ultimatum, likely hurt her and undermined the relationship's trust. The girlfriend's upset reaction is understandable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
