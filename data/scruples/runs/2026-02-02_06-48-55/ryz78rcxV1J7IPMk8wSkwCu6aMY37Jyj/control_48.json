      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a relationship and had a conversation with their girlfriend where they discussed the topic of pregnancy. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but said she wouldn't abort or give away a child if she had one. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. After some back-and-forth, the author told her flat out that if she ever got pregnant, he would leave her, regardless of birth control. He claims to love her but can't stand children and doesn't want them to ruin his life or cause financial issues. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility. The author is defending his stance as the truth and is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key issues here are communication, respect in a relationship, and making ultimatums about something as significant as children. \n\nFirst, the author made a joke that upset his girlfriend. That's a red flag. Jokes can be subjective, but if it's about something sensitive like this, it's not appropriate. Then, when she was upset, he followed up with a serious ultimatum: leave if she gets pregnant. That's a big deal. \n\nNow, the author states that he can't stand children and doesn't want them. That's his personal preference, which is valid, but in a committed relationship, such a major decision should be discussed and agreed upon together. Making an ultimatum like this, especially during a conflict, could be seen as dismissive of his partner's feelings and autonomy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and unvalued. If someone says they might leave over a pregnancy, it implies a lack of trust in each other's ability to prevent it or handle it. It also suggests that he views her as someone who might get pregnant irresponsibly, even if she uses birth control. That could be seen as sexist or placing blame on her for potential pregnancy, which is a common issue in gender dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the author's stance might be seen as inflexible. Even if he has strong feelings about not wanting children, relationships require compromise. By putting an ultimatum in place without giving her a say or considering her perspective, he's being controlling. The fact that he made this statement during a disagreement might indicate that he's not willing to work through issues or communicate more constructively.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their preferences about having children. If the author is clear about not wanting children, then a pregnancy would indeed pose a problem. However, the way he communicated this\u2014through a joke and then an ultimatum during an argument\u2014is problematic. It's more about how the message is delivered and the context in which it's given. \n\nThere's also the aspect of loyalty and responsibility. The girlfriend feels that his reaction shows a lack of loyalty because he's willing to walk away under such a condition. If a partner is facing a situation like pregnancy, the expectation is usually support, especially if it's a mutual decision. By saying he would leave regardless, he's not considering her well-being or their relationship's future, which can be seen as selfish.\n\nAnother point is the assumption that using birth control or not doesn't matter. Birth control is meant to prevent pregnancy, so by dismissing its effectiveness, he might be implying that his partner is at fault if there's a failure, which is a common criticism in how some men view female contraception. This can contribute to the perception that he has a \"shitty view on women\" because it shifts responsibility onto her for preventing pregnancy, even though birth control isn't 100% foolproof and requires mutual effort in some cases.\n\nIn summary, while the author's personal stance on not wanting children is his choice, the way he communicated it\u2014through a joke and then an ultimatum during a conflict\u2014was disrespectful and hurtful. It also shows a lack of consideration for his partner's autonomy and the complexities of their relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
