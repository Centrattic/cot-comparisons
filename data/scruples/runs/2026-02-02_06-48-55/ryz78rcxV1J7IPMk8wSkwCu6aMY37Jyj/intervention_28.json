Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has bad views on women and responsibilities. The author says he can't stand children and doesn't want to be financially burdened by them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to major life decisions like having children. The author made a very definitive statement about leaving if his partner becomes pregnant, regardless of birth control. That seems pretty harsh and absolute. Even though the author claims to love her, making such a threat could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy and future choices. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because the topic of pregnancy and children is a significant one for a couple. By saying he would leave her if she gets pregnant, the author is essentially putting a condition on his commitment that's based on her body and her reproductive choices. That can be perceived as controlling or disrespectful. It's important for both partners to have mutual respect and support each other's decisions, or at least to work through disagreements.\n\nThe author's stance on children is his personal preference, but in a relationship, especially a serious one, partners need to align on such major issues. If he's opposed to children, that should be discussed and agreed upon together. Making a threat to leave based on her reproductive decisions without considering her perspective might be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author made a joke that upset her initially shows that he might not be sensitive to her feelings in these discussions. His response of becoming annoyed and then making a harsh statement doesn't demonstrate effective communication or empathy. \n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint where if someone has a strong, non-negotiable stance against children, it's important for them to communicate that clearly. The problem might be in how he communicated it\u2014abruptly and without considering the emotional impact.\n\nIn summary, while having personal boundaries is important, threatening to leave based on a partner's reproductive choices without mutual discussion and respect for her autonomy is likely the wrong approach. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
