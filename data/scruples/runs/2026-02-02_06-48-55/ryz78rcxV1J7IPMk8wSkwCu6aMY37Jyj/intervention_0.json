Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. The key points here are about communication, expectations in a relationship, and maybe even values.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they can't stand children and don't want to be financially burdened by them. That's their personal choice, but when they made a joke about the girlfriend not giving the baby away, she got upset. Then they escalated it by flat out saying they'd leave if she got pregnant. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is hurt, feeling that he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility. The author is defending their stance by saying they told the truth. \n\nHmm. Relationships require mutual understanding and discussion about big issues like having kids. If they haven't discussed this before, bringing up a hypothetical scenario where one partner would leave seems harsh. Even if the author is clear about their stance, the way they communicated it might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is using this as a threat or a non-negotiable condition could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings and her own stance on not wanting kids soon but not wanting to give them up. If they're in a committed relationship, making such a definitive statement about leaving over a potential pregnancy that's not under the other person's control (since pregnancy can happen regardless of birth control) might be considered selfish or insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their feelings towards children. But honesty isn't an excuse for being hurtful. There's a line between being upfront about your boundaries and crossing into manipulative or controlling behavior. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because it shows she feels disrespected or devalued. If someone is in a relationship and one partner has such a strong aversion to children that they'd leave over it, that's a serious issue that needs careful discussion. However, the way the author presented it\u2014using a joke that upset her and then escalating to a direct threat\u2014likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with care, even if their feelings about children are legitimate. The way they expressed their stance could be seen as irresponsible and hurtful, not respecting the girlfriend's position and causing emotional distress.\n"
