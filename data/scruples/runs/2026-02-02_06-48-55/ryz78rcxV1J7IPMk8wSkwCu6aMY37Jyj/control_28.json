Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about leaving their girlfriend if she gets pregnant is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the nature of the comment, and the implications of the statement.\n\nFirst, the couple was discussing pregnancy. The girlfriend mentioned she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The boyfriend made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he escalated by saying he would leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control use. \n\nNow, considering the seriousness of the statement. Even if it was a joke initially, turning into a flat-out declaration of leaving shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and future possibilities. The girlfriend is upset because it feels like a betrayal or lack of commitment, especially regarding her potential needs as a parent. The boyfriend's reasoning is about not wanting children and not wanting his life ruined financially. However, making such a definitive statement without considering her autonomy and their relationship's future might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction points out issues with loyalty and views on women and responsibilities. The boyfriend's refusal to support her in a pregnancy could be seen as dismissing her as a person who might need his support in a major life event. Even if he doesn't want children, his response is extreme and doesn't account for her situation or the possibility of finding a solution together, like adoption or other support systems.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is key, but this response seems to prioritize his own stance without addressing her feelings or their mutual future. So, even if he's honest about his feelings, the way he expressed it and the ultimatum could be harmful. The answer here is likely A, as he's not considering her perspective and is using an absolute statement that could damage trust and emotional support in the relationship.\n"
