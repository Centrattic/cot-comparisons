Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend didn't want kids soon but said she wouldn't abort or give away a child. The author joked about not giving the baby away, she got upset, and he then made a serious statement about leaving her if she got pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the implications of his statement. Having a child is a major life decision and a huge responsibility. The author clearly doesn't want kids and is not willing to support a child financially. But by telling his girlfriend that he would leave her if she got pregnant, he's putting a condition on their relationship based on a possible future event that's not entirely under her control. \n\nEven if she's using birth control, accidents can happen. The fact that he's making this a non-negotiable condition might not respect her autonomy. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. By making such a definitive statement without discussing their future plans together, he might be dismissing her potential desires or the complexities of the situation. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling that your partner is setting a deal-breaker over an event that could lead to a child might make her feel undervalued. The author argues it's about his personal choice, but relationships involve compromise. If they can't find common ground on such a significant issue, it might indicate deeper problems. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his stance on children. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of respecting each other's rights and future possibilities. The way he communicated his position\u2014threatening to leave\u2014might be seen as controlling or dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the author is in the wrong. He should have approached the discussion with more empathy and openness to find a solution together rather than making an ultimatum based on a potential future pregnancy.\n"
