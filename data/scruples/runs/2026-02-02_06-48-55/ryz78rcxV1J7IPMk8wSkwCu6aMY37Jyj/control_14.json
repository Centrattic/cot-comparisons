Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for saying he would leave his girlfriend if she gets pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy states he doesn't want kids, never has, and can't stand them. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then, he told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, respect for each other's values, and the impact of his statement. The guy is clear about his stance on kids, but bringing up such a serious ultimatum in the heat of the moment might be problematic. Even if he's honest, telling someone you'll leave them if they become pregnant is a heavy statement. It could be seen as disrespectful, especially if it's a joke turned serious. Also, the girlfriend's reaction points to feeling disrespected and judged.\n\nHe mentions he loves her, but this ultimatum could be a dealbreaker for her. It's about whether his honesty is justified or if it's an overreaction. The fact that he said he'd leave regardless of birth control use might add to the problem, implying that even with precautions, he's not willing to accept the possibility. This could be seen as holding her responsible for a situation that's not entirely in her control, which might contribute to the judgment about women's responsibilities.\n\nIn relationships, discussing future plans like having kids is important, but the way it's communicated matters. Making a joke that turns into an ultimatum might not be the best approach. Even if his stance is clear, the manner in which he delivered it could be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's feelings of being judged and disrespected are valid here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his response was harsh and possibly hurtful, even if his intentions were to be honest. The way he communicated his stance without considering her feelings and the potential impact could be seen as the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
