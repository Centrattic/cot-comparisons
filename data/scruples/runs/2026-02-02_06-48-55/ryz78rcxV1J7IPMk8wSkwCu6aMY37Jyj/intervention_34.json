Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to leave his girlfriend if she gets pregnant. The situation is that they were discussing pregnancy, and the author made a joke, then later told her flat out he'd leave her if she got pregnant. He claims he can't stand kids and doesn't want to be financially ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's statement about leaving the relationship if she gets pregnant is a big deal. Even though he claims it as a joke initially and then a serious statement, it's a significant commitment issue. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a negative view of women and responsibilities. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, making such a definitive statement about ending a relationship in the case of an unplanned pregnancy is a red flag. It shows a lack of commitment to the future and a refusal to support a potential child, which is a major life decision. Even if both parties are against immediate parenthood, the author's response is extreme and doesn't leave room for compromise or discussion.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about financial concerns and unwillingness to have kids could be addressed through communication. If they were both on the same page about not wanting children, they might continue their current path. But the author's reaction seems to be a refusal to take on any responsibility related to parenthood, which is a fundamental part of a committed relationship if pregnancy occurs.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because such a statement can be perceived as controlling or disrespectful towards her autonomy. It raises questions about the author's commitment to the relationship and his partner's decisions. In healthy relationships, partners support each other's life choices, including decisions about having children, within mutual agreement. The author's ultimatum doesn't foster that support and instead creates a power imbalance.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's behavior is problematic. He made a serious threat that affects his partner's reproductive autonomy and future, which is a significant issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here. But I should also consider cultural or personal values, but the general consensus in many societies would lean towards supporting mutual respect and shared decision-making in relationships. So the answer is likely A, yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
