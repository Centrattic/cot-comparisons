Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author says they can't stand children and wouldn't want a kid to ruin their life or finances. They made a joke, but when the girlfriend got upset, they clarified that they would leave if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. The girlfriend feels disrespected and that the author has a poor view of women and responsibility.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? The main point is whether it's acceptable to set such a conditional in a relationship. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. By making an ultimatum based on a potential future event that's not entirely within either person's control, the author might be seen as being controlling or dismissive of their partner's autonomy. Even if the author has strong feelings against children, it's important to consider that decisions about pregnancy and parenthood are significant and should be mutual. The author's response was harsh and could be seen as invalidating their partner's feelings and choices.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that they would leave regardless of birth control use might imply they are placing blame on the girlfriend, which can be hurtful. Even if they love her, making such a definitive statement without considering the complexity of the situation shows a lack of empathy. The girlfriend's upset reaction is valid because it touches on her feelings of security and the respect she deserves in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were being honest about their non-negotiables. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of causing emotional harm without considering the impact. The way the author communicated their stance was confrontational and didn't leave room for discussion or compromise, which is essential in a healthy relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to set such a strict condition without mutual agreement and the way they communicated it likely caused harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
