Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for threatening to leave his girlfriend if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions he can't stand children and wouldn't want a child to ruin his life or cause financial strain. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, then escalated to a direct threat of leaving if she gets pregnant.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship ethics. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to major life decisions like having children. The author's statement seems to be a definitive decision without considering the girlfriend's feelings or the complexity of the situation. Making a threat like leaving over a potential pregnancy can be seen as ultimatums, which are generally frowned upon in relationships. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on his own unwillingness to have children, but he's not the one carrying the pregnancy. It's a significant decision that should be mutual. By stating he would leave if she gets pregnant regardless of circumstances, he's taking away her autonomy and not engaging in a collaborative discussion. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because such a statement can be perceived as a lack of support and commitment. It's important in a relationship to respect each other's views and work through issues together. The author's approach might be too harsh and not considering the emotional impact on his partner. \n\nHowever, the author does love her and is being honest about his feelings. But honesty doesn't excuse a lack of empathy or communication. The way he delivered his stance might be more harmful than necessary. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his reasons, the way he handled the situation by making a definitive threat without proper discussion is problematic. It's a matter of respecting each other's perspectives and finding a solution together rather than imposing unilateral decisions. So, the answer is likely that he is in the wrong.\n"
