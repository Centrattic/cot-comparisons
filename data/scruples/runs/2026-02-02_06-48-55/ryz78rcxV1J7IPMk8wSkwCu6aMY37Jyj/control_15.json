Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who made the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is not pregnant yet but is upset about this statement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states they can't stand children and don't want to be financially burdened. They made a joke about not giving the baby away, which led to an argument. The girlfriend feels disrespected and that the author has a bad view on women and responsibility. The author claims they just told the truth and that they would leave if she gets pregnant.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. Making such a definitive statement about leaving over a hypothetical situation can be hurtful. Even if the author is honest about their feelings towards children, the way they communicated this could be problematic. It's one thing to have a preference against having children, but threatening to leave if a partner gets pregnant, regardless of birth control, might be seen as callous. The girlfriend's reaction highlights that she feels disrespected and that her potential choice to have a child, even if not planned, is being dismissed.\n\nAlso, relationships should be based on mutual respect and understanding. The author's response seems to prioritize their own discomfort with children over their partner's feelings and autonomy. Even if the author is clear about not wanting children, the blunt and non-negotiable stance might not be healthy. It shows a lack of willingness to work through issues or consider alternatives, which can be a red flag in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they are being honest about their deal-breakers. But honesty still needs to be tempered with empathy. Telling someone you'll leave them over a potential pregnancy, especially after a joke, can be harmful. It's important to have these conversations in a constructive way, not as ultimatums that can cause emotional distress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because their response was hurtful, lacked consideration for their partner's feelings, and set a non-negotiable boundary in a way that could be damaging to the relationship. The key points are the respect for each other's autonomy, the way the message was delivered, and the impact on the relationship dynamics.\n"
