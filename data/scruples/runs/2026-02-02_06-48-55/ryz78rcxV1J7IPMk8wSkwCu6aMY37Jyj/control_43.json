      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They were talking about kids, and the GF doesn't want them soon but wouldn't abort or give up a child. The author makes a joke, she gets upset, and then he flat-out says he'll leave if she gets pregnant. He claims he can't stand kids and doesn't want them ruining his life financially. She's upset, calling him not loyal and having a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is about the author's stance on children and how he communicated it. He says he \"can't stand children, never have, probably never will,\" which is his personal preference. But making a relationship deal-breaker based on a potential future event (pregnancy) is a big deal. Even if he's honest, the way he stated it\u2014threatening to leave her if she gets pregnant\u2014seems pretty harsh. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong depends on a few factors. First, communication. Did he express his views about not wanting kids before? If this was the first time, maybe he didn't set clear expectations. But if they've discussed it before, maybe she knew his stance. However, in this scenario, it seems like he made a joke first, then escalated to a direct threat. That's probably not the best way to handle differing values in a relationship.\n\nAnother angle is respect and empathy. By telling her he'd leave if she got pregnant, he's essentially saying that her autonomy (if she chooses to keep the child) is incompatible with their relationship. But he's making a non-negotiable decision for her. Even if he's against kids, he's assuming control over her reproductive decisions, which could be seen as disrespectful. It's her body and her choice, but the author is using the pregnancy as a reason to leave, not necessarily her choice to have the child.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's upset because he called her out on this shows there's a conflict in values. The author is prioritizing his own comfort and financial stability over her potential desires, which might be unfair. If she values having children, this could be a deal-breaker for her too. But the problem here is the immediate, harsh reaction without considering alternatives or compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being upfront. If he can't handle the prospect of parenthood, it's reasonable for him to set that boundary. But the way he communicated it\u2014threatening to leave her outright\u2014is problematic. It's not a constructive discussion but a ultimatum. Relationships require mutual respect, and this might have breached that by not considering her feelings and future plans.\n\nIn summary, while he has the right to his personal preferences, the way he expressed them and the ultimatum itself are issues. It's about how you handle differences in values. So, likely, the author is in the wrong because he made a non-negotiable decision for his partner and communicated it in a harsh manner.\n"
