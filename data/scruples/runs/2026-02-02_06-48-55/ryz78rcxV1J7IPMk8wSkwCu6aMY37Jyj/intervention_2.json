Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend isn't pregnant yet, but they had a conversation where the topic came up. The guy made a joke, then got serious and said he'd leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities. The author defends his stance by saying he can't stand kids and wouldn't let a child ruin his life financially.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about the nature of the statement and the implications. The man is setting a condition for staying in the relationship based on a potential future event (pregnancy) that isn't under either of their control. Even if he's honest about not wanting kids, making such a definitive statement could be seen as controlling or putting pressure on the woman. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners need to have open and honest communication about their desires and boundaries. However, making a categorical statement like leaving if a certain event occurs (especially one that could be beyond their control) might be seen as inflexible. Even if the man has strong feelings against having children, the way he communicated his stance could be hurtful and dismissive of the woman's feelings and autonomy. \n\nThe woman's reaction suggests that she feels disrespected and that her potential as a mother is being judged. The man's comment about financial responsibility could also imply a lack of trust in the woman's ability to handle such a situation, which might contribute to her feeling that he has a negative view of women's roles. \n\nIt's important to consider that in any relationship, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. While it's okay to have personal boundaries, the way they are communicated matters. The man's approach here might have been too abrupt and lacked empathy, leading to the conflict. Additionally, the fact that he made a joke before the serious statement might have downplayed the gravity of the situation, leading to confusion before the harsh ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, the man is being upfront about his stance, which could be seen as honesty. However, honesty without consideration for the other person's feelings can still be harmful. The key issue here is the ultimatum and the lack of discussion about alternatives or compromise. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require flexibility and the willingness to address issues together. By setting such a strict boundary without considering the woman's perspective and without working together to find a solution, the man might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over partnership. \n\nTherefore, while the man's feelings are valid, the way he expressed them and the consequences of his statement likely contributed to the woman's distress. The answer would hinge on whether the man's approach was respectful and considerate of both parties' needs.\n"
