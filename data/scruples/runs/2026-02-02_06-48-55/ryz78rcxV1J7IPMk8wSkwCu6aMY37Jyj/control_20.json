Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend. They were talking about pregnancy, and he told her he would leave her if she got pregnant. He clarifies that he doesn't want kids and that he can't stand them. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities. He says he told her the truth.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he escalated it by stating he would leave her if she got pregnant. The key points here are the communication style, mutual expectations, and the implications of his statement.\n\nIn a relationship, major decisions like having a child should ideally be mutual. The author is unilaterally making a decision that affects both of them. Even if he's clear about his stance on not wanting kids, stating that he would leave her if she got pregnant is a serious ultimatum. It could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy, especially if she's considering her options but hasn't decided to have a child yet.\n\nHe mentions she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one away. His response might dismiss her potential future decisions. Even if she's not pregnant now, his statement could be seen as pressuring her into not having a child, which isn't her choice to make alone. Also, the way he delivered it\u2014joking first, then becoming serious\u2014could have been a poor way to handle a sensitive topic.\n\nFinancial concerns are part of his reasoning, but that doesn't necessarily justify the ultimatum. The issue is more about respecting each other's values and future plans. If they had discussed this earlier, maybe they could find a compromise, but he made a snap decision during an emotional conversation. That's probably not the healthiest approach.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his non-negotiables. People have different values, and if someone truly can't handle a situation, it's important to communicate that. However, doing so in a way that's dismissive of the other person's feelings and future choices might cross a line.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is making a decision that affects both of them without her consent. His statement could be seen as a betrayal of trust and a lack of support for her potential decisions. Even if he's clear about his stance, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum might make him the asshole. But there's also a balance between personal boundaries and respecting a partner's autonomy.\n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because he's making a unilateral decision that impacts both of them and not respecting her autonomy in the decision-making process. His financial concerns are valid, but the way he handled it and the ultimatum could be considered disrespectful.\n"
