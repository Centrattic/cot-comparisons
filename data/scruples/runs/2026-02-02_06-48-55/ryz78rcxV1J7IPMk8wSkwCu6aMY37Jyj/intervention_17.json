Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they would leave their girlfriend if she got pregnant. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he'd leave if she became pregnant, and she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says he doesn't like kids and wouldn't want a child to ruin his life financially. But he made a joke first, which led to the girlfriend getting upset. Then he escalated by making a serious statement about leaving if she got pregnant. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibility. The key points here are communication in a relationship, respect, and mutual understanding. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to be on the same page regarding major life decisions like having children. If the author is adamant about not wanting children, then it's important to discuss that openly. However, making a definitive statement about leaving if she gets pregnant, especially without considering the possibility that she might not be planning to have kids soon, can be seen as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nThe author's statement could be viewed as controlling or not considering his girlfriend's autonomy and her own stance on having children. Even though she said she wouldn't abort or give up a child, the author's response was a firm ultimatum. That might indicate a lack of compromise or consideration for her feelings and choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings towards children. But honesty doesn't excuse potentially harmful communication. The way he communicated his stance\u2014using a joke first, then a serious ultimatum\u2014might not have been the best approach. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction highlights concerns about loyalty and respect. If a partner feels that their significant other would abandon them over a pregnancy, that's a significant issue. It might suggest that the author isn't supportive of her potential life choices, which is a big deal in a relationship. \n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the author is in the wrong because he didn't approach the conversation with enough sensitivity and respect for his girlfriend's feelings, even though he is honest about his own. The ultimatum was harsh and didn't account for mutual decision-making. So the answer would be A.\n"
