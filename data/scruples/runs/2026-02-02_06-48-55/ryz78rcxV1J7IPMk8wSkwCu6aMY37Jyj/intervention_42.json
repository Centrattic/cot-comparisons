Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend doesn't want kids right now but said she wouldn't abort or give them away. The author made a joke, but when she got upset, he became annoyed and explicitly stated he would leave if she ever got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He claims he can't stand kids and doesn't want a child to ruin his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, calling him not loyal and having a bad view on women and responsibilities. The author argues he was just being honest.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. Telling someone you'll leave them if they get pregnant is a big deal. Even if he doesn't want kids, making that a deal-breaker without considering her feelings or their relationship dynamics could be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't say she wants kids right now, but also stated she wouldn't abort or give them up. The author's reaction seems extreme. By making that threat, he's essentially putting the responsibility of not getting pregnant entirely on her, which could be seen as placing an unfair burden on her. It's a classic example of the \"you're the only one who needs to use contraception\" mindset, which is often criticized as being dismissive of shared responsibility in relationships.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using this as a reason to leave implies that he's not willing to consider other possibilities. Maybe they could have a conversation about alternatives like adoption, or perhaps he could change his stance if she's committed to raising the child. But instead, he's making it a non-negotiable deal-breaker, which seems harsh.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and mutual respect are key. By making such a definitive statement, the author might be showing a lack of commitment to problem-solving together. It's possible that the girlfriend felt she couldn't discuss her own desires about children if he's already so firm on this issue. That could lead to resentment or feeling controlled.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being upfront about his feelings towards children. But even so, how he communicated it\u2014through a joke that escalated into a threat\u2014might be the issue. The way he handled the situation could be seen as insensitive, even if his stance is about his personal preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions could be viewed as inconsiderate and possibly dismissive of his girlfriend's autonomy and their relationship's future. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
