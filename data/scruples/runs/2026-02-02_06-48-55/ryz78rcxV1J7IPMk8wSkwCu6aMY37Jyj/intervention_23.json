Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author made a joke about not giving the baby away and then escalated to a serious statement about leaving if she ever got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected about her autonomy and responsibilities. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want kids and can't handle the financial burden, but he's making a commitment about leaving based on her potential choice.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, this seems harsh. Even if the author has strong feelings against children, making such a definitive statement before a pregnancy occurs might disregard her autonomy. The girlfriend has her own stance on not wanting kids soon but wouldn't consider abortion. The author's response is a ultimatum that doesn't leave room for discussion or compromise. It's important in relationships to respect each other's values and future plans. By setting such a strict boundary without considering her feelings or the complexity of the situation, the author might be seen as being controlling or dismissive of her agency. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a personal concern, but relationships often involve shared responsibilities and mutual support. By threatening to leave, the author is prioritizing his own preferences without considering how this affects the relationship's stability and trust. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and views on responsibility might stem from feeling that her rights as a partner are not respected. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is being honest about his stance on children, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum he set are problematic. It's about respecting each other's autonomy and working through differences rather than making absolute declarations that end the relationship based on future possibilities.\n"
