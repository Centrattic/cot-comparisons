      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend. They were talking about pregnancy, and she mentioned she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. He made a joke, and when she got upset, he ended up telling her he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. Now she's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities. He argues he's being honest about not wanting kids.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is the author making a definitive statement about leaving if she gets pregnant. The girlfriend is upset because that's a major commitment and a serious decision. The author's stance is that he doesn't want kids and would leave if there was a pregnancy, regardless of birth control. \n\nNow, I need to assess whether this makes him the asshole. Communication is a big part of relationships. Making a joke about not giving the baby away might have been the initial trigger, but escalating to a statement about leaving seems harsh. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, making an ultimatum like that could be seen as extreme. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because pregnancy is a significant life event that both partners should be on the same page about. By saying he would leave her if she got pregnant, he's essentially putting her in a position where she can't have a child without losing him, even if it's not her intention. She's not pregnant, but the statement itself could be seen as dismissive of her potential future desires or the complexities of their relationship dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is responsibility. He claims he doesn't want kids and wouldn't let a child ruin his life. However, making such a definitive statement without considering her feelings or the potential for future changes in her own stance on children might be selfish. Relationships often require compromise, and this seems like a refusal to compromise on a major issue. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that he's using birth control or not as a factor might be problematic. If they're using contraception, then the onus isn't entirely on her. But he's still holding her accountable regardless of that. That could be seen as unfair or placing blame on her for something that even with precautions, can happen. \n\nHe says he loves her, but his action here shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and the future of their relationship. It's possible he's not ready for a long-term commitment that includes discussing and planning for potential parenthood. However, making a blunt ultimatum is a harsh way to handle it.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, relationships where partners have differing views on children can work if they communicate and find a solution. By not being open to negotiation or support each other's views, he's creating a conflict. His response seems to prioritize his own preferences over her potential needs and the stability of their relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while everyone has the right to their preferences regarding children, the way he communicated his stance was confrontational and ultimatum-like, which can be damaging. His statement could be seen as abandoning his partner in a situation where she might have a child, which could be considered\u4e0d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb (irresponsible) or selfish. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
