Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'd leave her if she gets pregnant. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation properly. The author mentions that he and his girlfriend were discussing pregnancy. She says she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. He made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever got pregnant, he'd leave her, no matter the birth control. He loves her but can't stand kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nSo the key points here are: communication style, the context of the conversation, and the implications of his statement. Let's break it down. Making a joke that upsets someone and then escalating to a serious ultimatum might be problematic. Even if his stance on children is personal, the way he communicated it could be seen as disrespectful. He dismissed her feelings, maybe even her autonomy. If he's not open to having children, that's a major life decision, and his reaction seems extreme. Instead of a joke and then a harsh ultimatum, maybe discussing boundaries and expectations more constructively would be better. The fact that he's not open to children at all might mean that the relationship has fundamental incompatibilities, but the way he handles it here could be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and views on responsibility might stem from feeling that his threat is a rejection of her potential future choices. So, the author might be in the wrong because of how he communicated his stance, not necessarily the stance itself. But maybe there's nuance here. If he's honest about his feelings towards kids, that's part of being truthful in a relationship. However, threatening to leave her over a pregnancy is a strong move, especially without considering her perspective or their relationship's future. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
