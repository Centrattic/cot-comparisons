Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user told their girlfriend they would leave her if she ever got pregnant. The girlfriend didn't want kids soon but said she wouldn't abort or give one up. The user made a joke about her not giving the baby away, then later stated flatly that they'd leave if she got pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is very clear that they don't like kids and wouldn't want a child to ruin their life or cause financial strain. They love their girlfriend but have a strong stance against having children. The GF is upset, feeling that the user is not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities. \n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and respect in a relationship. Making a joke about a serious topic like pregnancy could be seen as insensitive, but the main issue is the user's statement that they would leave if the GF got pregnant. That's a significant statement because it imposes a condition on the relationship based on a natural biological possibility. \n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to major life decisions like having children, both partners need to have open and respectful communication. If the user has a firm stance against children, it's important to discuss that upfront and ensure both partners are aligned. However, making an ultimatum that would end the relationship based on a potential future event (pregnancy) without considering the other person's autonomy and choices might be problematic. \n\nThe GF's reaction is valid because she's expressing her own stance on not wanting to abort or give up a child. The user's response dismisses her potential choices and future decisions, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting her agency. Even if the user has a valid reason for not wanting kids, the way they communicated their stance\u2014threatening to leave\u2014could be hurtful and inflexible.\n\nAnother angle is that the user might not have considered the implications of such a statement. If the GF were to get pregnant unexpectedly, the user's reaction could lead to a breakdown in trust and support, which are crucial in a relationship. It's also possible that the user hasn't fully discussed this with the GF, leading to misunderstandings or lack of mutual understanding.\n\nHowever, it's also true that people have different life goals and sometimes incompatible ones can lead to difficult decisions. If the user is clear about their stance, they might not be at fault for prioritizing their own values. But the way they presented it\u2014threatening to leave without considering the GF's perspective\u2014might cross a line. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that the user is being realistic about their values, while others might see it as irresponsible or dismissive of the partner's autonomy. The key is whether the communication was respectful and whether both parties had a chance to discuss their views thoroughly. Since the user made a unilateral decision without considering the GF's reaction and feelings, it's more likely they are seen as the asshole here.\n"
