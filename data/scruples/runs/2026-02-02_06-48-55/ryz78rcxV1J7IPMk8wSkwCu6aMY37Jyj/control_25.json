Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying he'd leave his girlfriend if she got pregnant. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They mention that the girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author, who can't stand kids, makes a joke that turns into a serious threat.\n\nHmm, communication is key here. The author brought up a non-joke about leaving her if she got pregnant. That's a big deal because it's a conditional statement affecting their future together. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards children, making such a threat without considering her perspective might be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because unexpected pregnancy can happen despite birth control. The author's response might seem dismissive of her autonomy and ability to handle such a situation. By stating he'd leave, he's imposing his preferences without negotiating or understanding her stance. \n\nAlso, the idea of loyalty comes into play. She feels he's not loyal for using the possibility of a child as a reason to end the relationship. While the author is upfront about his stance on kids, the way he communicated it\u2014through a joke that escalated into a threat\u2014might be the issue. Relationships require compromise, and this seems like a lack of willingness to find middle ground. \n\nFinancial concerns are mentioned, but they shouldn't be the only factor. It's about mutual respect and partnership. If he can't handle the thought of children, they should have discussed it more thoroughly before making such a definitive statement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's blunt statement without considering the girlfriend's feelings and the potential for unexpected pregnancy is probably why he's in the wrong. He needs to take responsibility for his communication style and consider her autonomy.\n"
