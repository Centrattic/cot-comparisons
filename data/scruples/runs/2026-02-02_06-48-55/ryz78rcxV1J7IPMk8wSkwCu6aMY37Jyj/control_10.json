Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for threatening to leave his girlfriend if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author clearly states he doesn't want kids and never has. He loves his girlfriend but is firm about not wanting children. He made a joke that upset her, then escalated by saying he'd leave if she got pregnant. She's upset, feeling disrespected and that he has a negative view of women.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author's statement is a strong ultimatum. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards kids, making such a definitive statement without considering her perspective can be hurtful. It might make her feel like her potential future is being dismissed. Also, the fact that she already doesn't want kids soon but might keep them if they come up suggests there's some complexity there. The author's response might not leave room for discussion or compromise.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong for expressing his preferences. However, ethically and morally, in a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. By setting such a strict boundary without trying to find a middle ground, he's possibly violating her autonomy and emotional well-being. The key issue here is how he communicated his stance\u2014using a joke that upset her, then following up with a serious ultimatum. This could be seen as disrespectful and controlling.\n\nIt's important to note that relationships require mutual respect. If the author is open about his stance, but the girlfriend is considering pregnancy, there's a fundamental incompatibility. However, the way he delivered his message, especially the ultimatum, might be the problem. He didn't negotiate or explore solutions, just stated his exit strategy. That's where the asshole aspect comes in\u2014being inflexible and not considering her feelings or potential reactions. \n\nIn summary, while his stance on not wanting kids is his right, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum likely caused harm, making him the asshole.\n"
