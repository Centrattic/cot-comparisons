Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about him telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states he doesn't want kids and can't stand them. He made a joke that upset her, then escalated to saying he'll leave if she gets pregnant. She's upset, feeling he's not loyal or respectful.\n\nI should think about consent and communication in relationships. Major life decisions like having kids are usually mutual. By stating he would leave if she gets pregnant, he's imposing his wishes unilaterally. Even if she doesn't want kids soon, she's against abortion or giving up the child, so his ultimatum might force her into an unwanted choice. That could be seen as controlling or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, making a joke about not giving up a child and then turning it into a serious threat might have crossed a line. She might feel disrespected or pressured. The fact that he's using this as a threat instead of discussing their future together could be problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise, and this seems like a lack of both.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings towards kids, which is important. But the way he communicated it\u2014using a threat instead of a discussion\u2014might be the issue. There's a difference between setting boundaries and being disrespectful. The answer likely hinges on whether his approach was fair and respectful.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy in a major life decision and using a threat instead of collaborative problem-solving.\n"
