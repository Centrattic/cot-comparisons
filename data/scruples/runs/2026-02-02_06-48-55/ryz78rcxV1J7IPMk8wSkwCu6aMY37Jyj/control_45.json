Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, the context: They were discussing pregnancy. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give away a child. The author made a joke and then later stated he'd leave if she got pregnant. He claims he can't stand kids and doesn't want a child ruining his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, calling him loyal and having a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nNow, the key points. The author is making a definitive statement about his future reaction to an unplanned pregnancy. Even if he's against kids and it's a deal-breaker for him, telling her he'll leave immediately might be harsh. The girlfriend's reaction points to feeling disrespected and not considered equal in the relationship. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, such a statement can be seen as dismissive of her autonomy. Even if he's honest, the way he communicated it\u2014threatening to leave\u2014could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's boundaries. If he's not open to having children, ideally this should be discussed early and with consideration for both partners' views. But by making it an ultimatum, he might be imposing his stance without room for compromise. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's upset about his loyalty and view on responsibilities suggests she feels he's not committed to the relationship in a way that includes her potential choices. It's possible he's not wrong in his stance, but the manner and timing of his declaration could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, relationships often require negotiation on such major issues. If both parties aren't aligned, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. However, stating he'll leave immediately upon her getting pregnant, regardless of her intentions, might not consider the complexities of real-life situations. \n\nSo, considering all this, even though he's being honest about his feelings, the way he's handling it could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be the asshole for not respecting her feelings and autonomy in the decision-making process.\n"
