Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. The situation is that they were talking about kids, the girlfriend says she wouldn't abort or give up a child, and the guy says he'd leave if she got pregnant. He doesn't want kids and can't stand them financially.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. First, making a joke about her not giving the baby away\u2014that part might not be the main issue, but the follow-up where he's serious about leaving if she gets pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities. The author argues he's being truthful about his stance on kids.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and mutual expectations. If they're in a long-term relationship, discussing future plans like having kids is important. It sounds like there was a lack of prior discussion on this topic. The guy's decision to leave if she gets pregnant seems like a big deal. Even if he's clear about not wanting kids, making such a definitive statement during a conversation without prior agreement could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's not pregnant now but is upset about his reaction suggests that this statement might have been hurtful. Even if he's honest, the way he communicated it might not have considered her feelings. Maybe he didn't think about the implications of his words on her autonomy. Like, if she gets pregnant, would she be forced to terminate because he won't take responsibility? That could imply he's not taking responsibility for his own actions in a relationship. \n\nBut then again, he's stating his boundaries. If he's upfront about not wanting kids, maybe she needs to consider that in the relationship. However, making a definitive statement about leaving if she gets pregnant, especially if she didn't expect that, could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. It's a bit of a balance between personal boundaries and respecting the other person's choices.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say that it's his right to set such a boundary, but others would argue that it's unfair to pressure her into not having a child. The fact that she's pregnant or not isn't the point here\u2014it's about the ultimatum he gave. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his stance in a way that respects her autonomy. The ultimatum could be seen as dismissive and not considering her potential desires or situations. Even if his stance on kids is clear, the way he expressed it during the conversation was harmful and didn't allow for mutual decision-making. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
