Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. The main points here are about communication, consent, and mutual understanding in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions making a joke about not giving the baby away, which upset his girlfriend. Then he escalated by clearly stating he'd leave if she got pregnant. He loves her but can't stand kids and doesn't want his life or finances ruined. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nSo, what's important here? Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Making a joke about pregnancy might not be the worst, but when it leads to a serious ultimatum, that's where problems arise. The key issue is that he's imposing his stance on having kids without considering her autonomy. Even if he doesn't want kids, he should discuss it openly and support her decisions. By threatening to leave if she gets pregnant, he's not respecting her potential choice to become a parent, even if he opposes it. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's against abortion and giving the child away suggests she might want to parent. His reaction contradicts her wishes. That's a red flag in a relationship because it shows a lack of support for her decisions. Communication is crucial, and he should have approached this more thoughtfully instead of making a blunt threat. \n\nSo, while he's honest about his feelings, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum he set are problematic. It's about respecting each other's values and future plans. If he can't handle the possibility of her wanting to have a child, maybe they need to discuss long-term compatibility. But threatening to leave over her reproductive choices is a serious issue. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
