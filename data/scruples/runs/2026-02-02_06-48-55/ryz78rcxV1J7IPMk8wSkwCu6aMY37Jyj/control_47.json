Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their girlfriend were discussing pregnancy. The girlfriend mentioned she doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author made a joke which upset her, and then later told her flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling the author is unloyal and has a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect, and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author's statement is a clear ultimatum regarding a significant life decision. Pregnancy is a major issue that affects both partners, and making such a decision unilaterally without considering the partner's feelings or the future of the relationship could be problematic.\n\nThe author claims they can't stand children and don't want a kid to ruin their life financially. While personal preferences about having kids are valid, the way the author communicated this\u2014by threatening to leave\u2014might be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings and future plans. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected and possibly devalued, as if her potential role as a parent was not considered.\n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing such sensitive topics, open and respectful communication is crucial. Making a joke and then following up with a serious threat might not be the healthiest way to handle differing views. The author's stance is firm, but relationships often require compromise and understanding. By stating they would leave immediately, the author might be prioritizing their own preferences without considering the emotional impact on their partner or the possibility of working through the issue together.\n\nHowever, the author did mention they love their girlfriend but can't stand children. This shows a personal conviction. But even so, using a pregnancy as a deal-breaker without discussing alternatives (like adoption, if both agree, or other solutions) could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend's perspective is that the author is avoiding responsibility and has a negative view of women's roles, which might not be entirely true, but the way the author communicated their stance could have come across that way.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they made a decision that affects both of them without mutual discussion and in a way that hurt their partner's feelings. Relationships require both parties to respect each other's views and work through challenges together, rather than imposing ultimatums.\n"
