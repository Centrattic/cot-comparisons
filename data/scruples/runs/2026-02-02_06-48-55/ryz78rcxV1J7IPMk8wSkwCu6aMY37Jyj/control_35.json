Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He mentions that he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that he's not loyal and has a poor view of women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he escalated by stating outright that he would leave if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. This seems like a serious ultimatum. \n\nNow, relationships involve mutual respect and communication. The fact that they were discussing the topic of pregnancy suggests it's an important issue. The author's response is a strong one, which might be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's potential future decisions. Even though he claims to love her, his statement could be seen as threatening, especially since it's a non-negotiable condition. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is about personal values and not wanting children. That's his choice, but how he communicates it matters. Making an ultimatum without considering the other person's feelings or possible reactions might be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt disrespected, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nAlso, the author says he can't stand children and wouldn't want them to affect his life. However, if a pregnancy occurs, there are options beyond just leaving the relationship, like adoption or shared decision-making. By stating he would leave immediately, he's removing those possibilities and putting the burden on her. \n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't wait to see how the conversation would proceed. He escalated by giving an ultimatum, which can be seen as controlling or not trusting her to handle the situation responsibly. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being questioned, especially if she mentioned she wouldn't abort or give away a child. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to have discussions about future plans, including children, but doing so in a way that's respectful and considerate. The author's approach here seems abrupt and harsh, which could damage trust and mutual respect. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as the wrong approach because of the ultimatum and the lack of empathy for the girlfriend's feelings. Even if his stance on children is valid, the way he communicated it is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
