Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is at fault. The situation involves the boyfriend telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states he can't stand children and doesn't want them. He made a joke that upset her, then escalated by saying he'd leave if she got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has negative views on women and responsibilities. \n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Making such a definitive statement about leaving a partner if they get pregnant is a big deal. Even if both are against kids, the way he communicated it could be harmful. The joke first, then the serious declaration\u2014maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nRelationships require mutual support and respect. If one partner has a strong stance against children, they should discuss it openly. However, threatening to leave the other if something like pregnancy occurs might be seen as controlling or disrespectful. It's about whether consent and future planning were discussed. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's feelings matter. She didn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort them. The author's reaction could undermine her autonomy. Even if he's honest, the method and timing might be the issue. \n\nFinancial concerns are mentioned, but that's his personal stance. Still, the main issue is the ultimatum. In relationships, both partners need to be on the same page, especially regarding such major life decisions. If he's unwilling to support her if she decides to have a child, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and autonomy, and made a harsh statement without a constructive discussion. Answer A.\n"
