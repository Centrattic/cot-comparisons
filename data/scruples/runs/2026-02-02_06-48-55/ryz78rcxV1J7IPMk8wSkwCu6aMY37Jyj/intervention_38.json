Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. They weren't even discussing actual pregnancy, just talking about the topic. He made a joke first, then escalated to a serious statement. She's upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a bad view of women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy says he can't stand kids and doesn't want them ruining his life. He told her that if she gets pregnant, he'll leave. But this was during a conversation where she mentioned she doesn't want kids yet but wouldn't abort or give one up. He made a joke first, then after she got upset, he escalated to a flat-out statement. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, making a joke about not giving the baby away might be insensitive, but the main issue is his reaction. By telling her he'll leave if she gets pregnant, he's putting a condition on his commitment based on her potential actions. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards kids, that decision affects both of them. She's not pregnant yet, so he's making a threat based on a hypothetical that's not under her control. \n\nAlso, in a relationship, such a statement can be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy. If he truly can't handle having kids, maybe they should discuss it more thoroughly rather than making a unilateral decision. But by stating that he'll leave her if she gets pregnant, he's not respecting her choice to not have kids yet and possibly change her mind later. \n\nHis reasoning is that he can't stand kids and doesn't want financial burden. However, the fact that she says she wouldn't give up a child means that if she gets pregnant, she wants to keep it. He's essentially saying he can't support her choice. That could be seen as a deal-breaker, but the way he delivered it\u2014making a joke first and then a serious ultimatum\u2014seems harsh. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. Instead of making such a blunt statement, discussing the issue more thoughtfully, respecting each other's feelings, and finding a mutual understanding would be better. His response might be seen as selfish because it dismisses her future choices and puts the responsibility on her. \n\nSo, yes, he's in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation with empathy or respect for her feelings. Making a joke and then a serious threat isn't appropriate. The answer should be A.\n"
