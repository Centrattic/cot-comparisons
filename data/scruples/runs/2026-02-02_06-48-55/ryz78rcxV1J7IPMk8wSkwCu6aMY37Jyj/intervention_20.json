Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend that he would leave her if she became pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's being disloyal and has negative views on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a joke first, then escalated to a serious statement about leaving her if she got pregnant. He loves her but has a strong aversion to children and doesn't want a kid to affect his life financially. The girlfriend feels it's a betrayal and shows disrespect towards her autonomy and possible choices.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, communication is crucial. Making such a definitive statement about leaving if a pregnancy occurs is a major red flag. It's important to respect a partner's autonomy in decisions about pregnancy and parenthood. The author's statement seems to disregard her potential choices and the mutual responsibilities in a relationship. Even if he doesn't want kids, a healthy relationship requires discussing and respecting each other's boundaries and future plans. By stating he would leave unilaterally, he's imposing his will without considering her perspective, which could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. The girlfriend's reaction highlights feelings of betrayal, which are valid given the severity of the statement. The author's justification about not wanting to be financially burdened might be his reasoning, but it's not a valid reason to dismiss her autonomy and well-being. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because his statement shows a lack of respect for his partner's agency and the relationship's foundation of mutual respect.\n"
