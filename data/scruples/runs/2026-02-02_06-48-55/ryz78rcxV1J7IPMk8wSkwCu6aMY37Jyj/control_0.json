Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He mentions that he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. She's upset, thinking he's not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were talking about pregnancy, and he made a joke that led to him being serious about leaving if she got pregnant. Even though he says he loves her, making such a definitive statement might be a deal-breaker for her. The key points here are communication, respect for her autonomy, and the implications of such a statement.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, being upfront about one's boundaries is important, but the way he communicated it might be problematic. He used a joke initially, which could have been hurtful, and then escalated to a serious ultimatum. His girlfriend's feelings about not wanting kids soon but not wanting to abort might be conflicting with his stance. If he's unwilling to consider any possibility of a child, even if she's not ready, that might be seen as dismissive of her potential future plans or his own potential change of heart. Also, implying that she might force him into parenthood he's against could be seen as distrustful.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that she would get pregnant against his wishes. Birth control exists, but he dismisses that as a factor. This might show a lack of trust in her ability to manage her reproductive choices, which could be a significant issue. His reaction might also be seen as prioritizing his own fears over her autonomy and the relationship's future.\n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his stance on children and his values. He's not making her pregnant, and he's clear about his limits. But relationships often involve mutual respect and considering each other's needs. His ultimatum could be seen as a lack of willingness to compromise or work through issues together. The fact that he's okay with walking away but not considering her perspective might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the main issue is whether his statement is a valid expression of his boundaries or an overreach that disregards her agency. Since he's making a non-negotiable statement about leaving her based on a hypothetical situation (pregnancy) that involves both their lives, it's a significant decision that affects her autonomy. His refusal to consider any scenario where they might have a child together, even with her consent, could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because his response dismisses her reproductive rights and the possibility of mutual problem-solving. So the answer would be A.\n"
