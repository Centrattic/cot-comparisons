Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she gets pregnant. The girlfriend didn't want kids soon, but she said she wouldn't abort or give a baby up. The author made a joke, then got serious and told her he'd leave if she got pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says he doesn't like kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. But the problem here is that he's making a binding decision for both of them regarding pregnancy. Even though the girlfriend is willing to carry the pregnancy to term, the author is effectively saying that if she becomes pregnant, regardless of her choice to have the baby, he would leave her. That seems like a major issue because he's not considering her autonomy. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners should have mutual respect for each other's choices. If he can't accept her decision to have the baby, that's a problem. Also, making such a serious statement as a reaction to a joke might be seen as harsh and not thoughtfully considered. It's possible that he's being selfish by not supporting her if she decides to have a child, especially since she's already stated she wouldn't abort or give the child up. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings towards children. But honesty doesn't excuse being dismissive of her wishes. He might need to take responsibility for how his words affected her. The girlfriend feels disrespected and that he has a poor view of women and responsibilities. That's a valid reaction because he's not supporting her in a life decision she's willing to make. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is making a decision that affects both of them without considering her stance. Even if he has valid reasons for not wanting kids, imposing that on her is problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
