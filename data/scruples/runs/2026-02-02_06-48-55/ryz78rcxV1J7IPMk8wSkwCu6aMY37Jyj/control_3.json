Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He claims he can't stand kids and wouldn't want a child ruining his life. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a joke first, then escalated to a firm statement. Even if he's being truthful about his feelings towards children, how he communicated it might be an issue. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because getting pregnant is a significant life decision and a big deal for both partners. By making such a definitive statement, the author is essentially putting pressure on her regarding a major aspect of her life that's beyond her control, like birth control effectiveness.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is dismissing potential responsibilities and the possibility of a child in the relationship could lead to future conflicts. Even if he's honest, the way he's handling it might be seen as disrespectful to her autonomy. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration of each other's major life decisions. By saying he would leave her if she gets pregnant, he's not just stating his preference but also imposing a condition that affects her personal choices, which can be seen as controlling or dismissive of her rights to decide about her own body and future.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected and the implication that she might be blamed for getting pregnant (even if it's unintended) adds to the problem. Even if the author isn't to blame in terms of his personal beliefs, the way he's communicated and enforced this boundary in the relationship might be considered the wrong approach. Healthy relationships involve discussing such serious topics with empathy and understanding, not ultimatums that can be seen as ultimatums over issues beyond someone's control.\n"
