Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their girlfriend they would leave her if she got pregnant. The main points are: the author doesn't like kids and wouldn't want to be responsible for a child. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author made a joke about not giving the baby away, which upset her, and then he got annoyed and told her outright he'd leave if she got pregnant.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author claims they love their girlfriend but can't stand children. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the author is not loyal and has a bad view of women and responsibilities. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be financially burdened by a child and can't handle the responsibility. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Making a joke about not giving the baby away might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Then, when she gets upset, he follows up with a serious statement about leaving if she gets pregnant. That seems harsh. Even if he's honest about his feelings towards kids, the way he communicated it might be problematic. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. If the author had a strong stance on not wanting children, they should have discussed this openly and respectfully from the start. Making a joke that leads to an ultimatum could be seen as disrespectful. Also, considering that the girlfriend has her own stance on not aborting or giving up a child, the author didn't leave room for compromise. \n\nMoreover, the author's statement that they'd leave regardless of birth control use seems to place the blame solely on her, which might not be fair. Relationships require mutual understanding and shared responsibilities. If the author is certain about not wanting children, maybe the decision should be mutual. But by setting an ultimatum, he's not considering her autonomy or the possibility that she might change her mind or that they could find another solution together.\n\nHowever, the author is being honest about their feelings. They might believe that they have the right to set boundaries in their relationship. But the method of communication and the ultimatum could be the issue. It's possible that a more constructive conversation could have led to a better understanding without making her feel threatened or disrespected.\n\nIn terms of loyalty and responsibility, the girlfriend's perspective is that he's being disloyal by not standing by her in a significant life decision. The author's view is that they're being truthful about their limits. But in a committed relationship, partners often support each other through challenges, including unexpected pregnancies. By threatening to leave, the author might be seen as not supporting his partner in a crucial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is absolutely certain that they can't handle a child, maybe they have a right to voice that. But it's about how they present it. An ultimatum without considering the partner's feelings or the relationship's future together might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's honesty is commendable, the way he communicated his stance and the ultimatum could be seen as the wrong approach. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, and the author's response might not have demonstrated that. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
