Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple discussing pregnancy. The guy says he can't stand kids and would leave his girlfriend if she got pregnant, even joking about it first. She's upset because she doesn't want kids yet but wouldn't abort or give them up. He ends up being honest that he'd leave, and she's now upset, accusing him of bad views on women and responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Communication is key in relationships, especially about such a big life decision. The man made a joke, then escalated to a serious statement. Even if he's honest, saying he would leave upon her getting pregnant is a big deal. It's a conditional commitment\u2014staying only if she doesn't get pregnant. That could be seen as ultimatums, which can be harmful.\n\nHe claims to love her but can't handle children. That\u2019s a personal choice, but bringing it up in the context of her not wanting kids yet might be problematic. If he's not open to any children, they need to have that conversation early. But doing it without considering her feelings and the implications of his statement could be the issue.\n\nThe girlfriend is hurt because she sees this as not being loyal and having negative views on women. Even if he's being honest, the way he communicates it matters. Making a joke and then a blunt statement might be dismissive of her feelings and future plans. Also, the fact that he's willing to leave over her not controlling a pregnancy (even if she's not using birth control) could imply a lack of support or understanding. \n\nIn relationships, respect and empathy are crucial. If one partner is making a decision that effectively ends the relationship based on a potential future event that's not entirely within the other person's control, that's a heavy burden. The boyfriend's stance might be seen as not taking responsibility for his own part in a potential pregnancy, shifting the blame onto her. \n\nSo, while he's being honest about his feelings towards children, the way he communicated it and the ultimatum he gave could be considered wrong. It's about how he handles the conversation, the ultimatum, and the lack of mutual planning for the future. The answer likely leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because his statement is a harsh ultimatum without considering her perspective or offering a solution. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like if they had prior discussions about children, but the scenario doesn't mention that. Since he's making a decision that affects both of them, he should have a more collaborative approach.\n"
