      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author told his girlfriend he'd leave her if she gets pregnant, even if it's not on purpose. He says he can't stand children and doesn't want a kid to ruin his life financially. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a joke about her not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then he escalated by stating he'd leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He loves her but is clear about not wanting kids. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about relationship expectations. Generally, major life decisions like having children are supposed to be mutual. If he's so opposed to having kids that he wouldn't stay in the relationship if she got pregnant, that's a serious stance. Even if both partners agree not to have kids, there's always a risk of unexpected pregnancy. The author's response seems extreme. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014feeling he's not loyal and has a poor view of women/responsibility\u2014might stem from the fact that he's making a unilateral decision that affects both of them. It's about trust and respect in the relationship. By saying he'd leave her if she got pregnant, he's not considering her feelings or the shared responsibility. \n\nAnother angle is the use of a joke that backfired. Maybe the initial comment about not giving the baby away was a poor choice, but the main issue is his absolute stance on leaving the relationship. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner's non-negotiables can't be met even in a scenario both want to avoid, that's a problem. \n\nFinancial concerns are personal, but the way he frames it as \"not letting a kid ruin his life\" might come off as selfish. It's important to respect each other's boundaries, but his boundary might be too rigid here. The girlfriend might feel that he's not committed to the relationship long-term if something unexpected happens. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while people have different views on kids, making a definitive statement to leave a partner over an unforeseen situation could be seen as lacking commitment. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong if he's honest about his limitations, but the way he communicated it and the consequences on the relationship are problematic. \n\nHowever, if the couple had already discussed their stance on children and agreed not to have them, maybe the author's honesty isn't wrong. But since the girlfriend didn't want kids soon but wouldn't give them up, the author's threat to leave seems harsh. It's about whether the relationship can handle unexpected circumstances and mutual support.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions likely caused harm to the relationship. He didn't consider the emotional impact and made a unilateral decision affecting both. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
