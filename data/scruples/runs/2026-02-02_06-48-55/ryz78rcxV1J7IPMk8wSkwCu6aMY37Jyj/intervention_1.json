Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant, even joking about it first. He explains that he doesn't like kids and doesn't want to be financially burdened by them. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that the author is being disloyal and has bad views on women and responsibility. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author made a joke about not giving away the baby, which led to a serious statement about leaving if she gets pregnant. Even if it was a joke, the girlfriend felt hurt. Then, he escalated by stating clearly that he would leave her if she were to get pregnant. This seems like a very serious and conditional commitment. \n\nIn a committed relationship, making such a definitive statement about leaving based on a possible future event (pregnancy) could be seen as a lack of commitment. It's also important to note that the girlfriend has her own stance on not wanting kids soon but wouldn't abort. The author's response is a clear ultimatum that disregards her potential autonomy and their relationship's future. \n\nFinancial concerns and personal preferences about children are valid, but how the author communicated this is problematic. Making a joke about not giving away the baby and then following up with a serious threat of leaving could be seen as emotionally manipulative or dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction about loyalty and responsibility might stem from feeling that her potential choice to have a child is being used as a reason to abandon the relationship, which might imply that he doesn't fully support her decisions or their future together.\n\nAdditionally, in relationships, it's crucial to discuss such significant issues openly and find mutual agreements. The author's approach here seems abrupt and not based on prior discussion. It's possible that they hadn't had a serious conversation about having children, and his response was a reaction rather than an informed decision. \n\nHowever, the author does mention that he loves her but can't stand children. That's his personal preference, but in a relationship, both partners need to make compromises. If the author is so adamant about not wanting children, maybe the issue is more about not having discussed it in depth before. But once the statement is made, it's a serious commitment to leave the relationship over a potential pregnancy, which can be seen as a breach of trust and commitment.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally expected that partners support each other through challenges, including unexpected situations like unplanned pregnancies. The author's reaction might be viewed as selfish or not taking into account the girlfriend's potential needs and feelings. However, there's also the argument that if someone has a firm stance against children, it's reasonable to set boundaries. But the way he communicated it\u2014making a joke first and then a serious ultimatum\u2014might be the problem.\n\nI should also consider consent and mutual understanding. If they hadn't discussed children before, bringing up such a definitive statement in the heat of the moment might not be fair. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being threatened if she were to become pregnant unintentionally. However, the author is also within his rights to express his feelings, but the manner in which he did so is likely the issue here.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's actions seem to be in the wrong because of the way he communicated his stance, the lack of prior discussion, and the ultimatum which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The girlfriend's feelings of disloyalty and lack of support are valid responses to such a statement.\n"
