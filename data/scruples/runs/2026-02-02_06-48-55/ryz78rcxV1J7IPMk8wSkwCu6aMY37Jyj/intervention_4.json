Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'll leave her if she gets pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states that he can't stand children and doesn't want them. He made a joke that turned into a serious statement about leaving her if she gets pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, feeling he's not loyal and has a poor view of women and responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and respect. The author's statement is a conditional breakup based on a possible future event. Even though the woman isn't pregnant, the threat is made in a moment of conflict. The author might be honest about his feelings, but how he communicated them is problematic. Using a serious consequence like leaving the relationship in response to an unplanned pregnancy, even if he doesn't currently support having kids, can be seen as controlling or disrespectful. It also assumes he can dictate her choices, which might infringe on her autonomy.\n\nThe woman's response about loyalty and responsibilities suggests she feels the threat is a betrayal of trust and commitment. The author's reasoning that he would leave if she gets pregnant, regardless of birth control use, might not account for the complexity of unplanned pregnancies. This could be seen as not considering her agency or the reality that even with precautions, accidents happen.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but it's also crucial to approach difficult topics with empathy and mutual respect. The author's approach seems to lack that. He might not be the asshole for having different views on children, but the way he communicated his decision is where he likely went wrong. The threat of leaving over a potential future event without considering the nuances and the partner's perspective is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
