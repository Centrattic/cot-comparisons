Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend he'd leave her if she got pregnant. Hmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author mentions he can't stand children and doesn't want them. The girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give one up. The author made a joke that upset her, then said flat out he'd leave if she got pregnant.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, making a joke that leads to a serious conversation might not be the best approach. But the key is his statement about leaving. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If they haven't discussed their future plans regarding kids, this could be a problem. The author is clear about his stance, but maybe he should have approached it more sensitively. However, if they're both honest about their views, it's not necessarily wrong. But by saying he'd leave her if she got pregnant, even if she didn't want to abort, that might be a deal-breaker. It could be seen as holding her responsible for something they haven't fully discussed. Also, she's upset because he's not loyal, which might relate to trust and support in the relationship. Ultimately, it's about whether his response was respectful and if they had the right conversation. Since he didn't consider her feelings immediately and made a harsh statement, he's probably in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
