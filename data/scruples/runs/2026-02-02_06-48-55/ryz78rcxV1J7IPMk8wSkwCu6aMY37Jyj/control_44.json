Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. He says he doesn't want kids and couldn't handle the financial and life implications. She's upset, thinking he's being unfair and has a bad view on women and responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a joke first about not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then, when she was upset, he clarified he would leave her if she got pregnant, regardless of birth control. He loves her but is firm about not wanting kids. She's hurt, feeling disloyal and that he's shirking responsibility.\n\nNow, relationships often require compromise and communication. If both partners can't agree on major issues like having children, that's a big problem. The author's stance is that he can't handle kids, but he's being upfront. However, the way he communicated this\u2014making a joke first, then a blunt statement when she was upset\u2014might be problematic. Timing and delivery matter. She might feel pressured or that he wasn't listening to her feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's claim that he would leave her if she got pregnant, even if she doesn't abort, suggests that he's imposing his will on her, which could be controlling. Reproductive rights and autonomy are important. If she's not pregnant but expressing her stance, his immediate threat to leave might be seen as disrespectful to her autonomy and their relationship's future.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings. But honesty shouldn't come at the cost of disregarding the other person's emotions and needs. The fact that he was annoyed during the conversation and escalated it when she was upset shows poor conflict management. He should have addressed the issue in a more respectful and calm manner, considering her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, such a significant decision (like leaving over pregnancy) needs to be discussed with empathy and understanding. The author's response seems harsh and dismissive. Even if he doesn't want kids, the way he handles it affects their relationship's health. It's possible he's not the asshole for being honest, but the manner in which he delivered it and the lack of consideration for her feelings might make him the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with empathy, his response was abrupt, and he didn't respect her autonomy in the conversation.\n"
