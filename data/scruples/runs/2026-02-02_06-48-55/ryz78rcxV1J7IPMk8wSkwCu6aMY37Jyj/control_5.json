Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. He claims he can't stand kids and doesn't want them to ruin his life financially. She's upset, saying he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a joke that escalated into a serious ultimatum. He states that even with birth control, if she gets pregnant, he's leaving. His reasoning is about not wanting kids and the financial burden. The girlfriend is upset because she's against abortion but doesn't want kids soon. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, making such a definitive statement about leaving over a potential future scenario that's not in either of their control might be seen as extreme. It's important that both partners discuss and agree on major life decisions like having children. If one partner is strongly against it and the other is open to it under certain circumstances, that's a significant issue. However, the author's statement seems to dismiss her wishes and possibly undermines her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author was annoyed and pushed her into this ultimatum might indicate a lack of communication and respect. Relationships require compromise and understanding. By not addressing this as a mutual decision and instead making a unilateral statement, he might be seen as not considering her feelings and future choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his stance on children. But honesty shouldn't be used as a shield for hurting someone. The way he communicated his position was harsh and possibly disrespectful. \n\nResponsibility-wise, if they are in a committed relationship, both should discuss such matters. However, the author's response to her not wanting to give up a child (even if not immediately) and his ultimatum could be seen as not taking her feelings into account. \n\nFinancial concerns are valid, but using that as a reason to leave the relationship without considering her perspective might not be fair. It's about mutual support and finding solutions together, not one person dictating terms. \n\nIn terms of loyalty and respect, saying he would leave if she got pregnant despite her not wanting kids soon might be viewed as lacking commitment. It's possible that the girlfriend might feel that he's not standing by her in a future scenario she's prepared for. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's statement is likely the wrong approach. He should have discussed this as a partnership, not as a condition he's imposing. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
