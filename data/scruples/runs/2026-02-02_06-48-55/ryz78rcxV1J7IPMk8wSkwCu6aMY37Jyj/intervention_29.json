Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told their girlfriend he would leave her if she got pregnant. The girlfriend isn't pregnant, but she's upset because he made that statement. The author mentions he doesn't like kids and wouldn't want a child ruining his life financially. The girlfriend is now upset, accusing him of not being loyal and having a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states he can't stand children and would never let a child ruin his life. That seems like a personal choice, but when it comes to a relationship, especially regarding potential children, communication and mutual agreement are key. The fact that the girlfriend doesn't want kids soon but wouldn't abort or give them away is important. If the author is clear about not wanting children at all, then the girlfriend's stance might be a deal-breaker. However, the way the author communicated this\u2014threatening to leave if she gets pregnant\u2014is problematic.\n\nThreatening to leave someone based on a potential future event that's beyond their control (like pregnancy) could be seen as harsh. Even if it's a personal choice, the method of conveying it as a joke and then a blunt threat might have been unkind and dismissive of her feelings. The author also mentions making a joke first, which might have been a way to test her reaction before making a serious statement. That could come off as manipulative or insensitive.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's reactions about loyalty and views on women and responsibilities might be valid. If the author is not flexible in his stance and is using this as an ultimatum, it could indicate a lack of commitment to work through issues that arise in a relationship. Relationships require compromise, and making an absolute statement like that could be seen as unwillingness to adapt or find a middle ground.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he's being truthful about his non-negotiables. If having a child is something he absolutely cannot handle, then his stance isn't inherently wrong in terms of honesty. But the way he communicated it and the impact on his girlfriend are key factors here. The threat to leave might be seen as extreme and could be considered emotionally manipulative, even if his feelings are genuine.\n\nI think the main issue is the way he expressed his feelings rather than the feelings themselves. If he had discussed his concerns about children and their financial implications in a more supportive and collaborative manner, maybe they could have found a solution together. But by using a threat, he's not inviting dialogue but rather imposing a condition that could end the relationship abruptly if she becomes pregnant. That's where the author might be in the wrong because it doesn't respect her autonomy or their partnership's dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because of how he communicated his stance, even if his personal feelings about not wanting children are valid. The answer would be A.\n"
