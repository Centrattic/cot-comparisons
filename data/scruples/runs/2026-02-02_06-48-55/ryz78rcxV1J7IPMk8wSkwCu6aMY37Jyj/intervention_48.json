Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told his girlfriend he would leave her if she ever got pregnant. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's not loyal and has a bad view on women and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author is clear about not wanting children and being unwilling to take on the responsibility. He made a joke first, then escalated to a serious statement about leaving if she gets pregnant. The girlfriend didn't want kids soon but said she wouldn't abort or give them up. So there's a conflict here about their future plans.\n\nNow, considering relationship expectations. Usually, major life decisions like having children are something couples discuss and agree on. If one partner has a non-negotiable stance that's harmful to the other's potential desires, that could be problematic. The author's response is extreme\u2014threatening to leave if she becomes pregnant. That's a big deal because it's a direct ultimatum based on a potential future event.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author dismissed her feelings and called her out on her stance without considering her perspective might be an issue. Communication is key in relationships, and being upfront about such a serious topic is important, but the way he did it\u2014joking first, then getting annoyed and making a firm statement\u2014might have been hurtful and not respectful of her feelings.\n\nAnother angle: societal norms and values. Some might argue that it's a personal choice to not have kids, but making a partner choose between their own potential to have children and the relationship is a significant decision. If the girlfriend wants to have kids someday, the author's ultimatum forces her to either forgo that possibility or lose him. That could be seen as pressuring her in a way that's not supportive.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that he can't handle the financial and life changes that come with kids. That's his valid stance, but how he communicated it matters. Instead of being open to discussion or compromise, he's making a firm decision that affects both of them without her consent or input.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not wrong for having his own stance on kids, but the way he communicated it and the ultimatum he gave could be seen as dismissive and not considering his partner's future. Therefore, the answer is likely A, he is in the wrong.\n"
