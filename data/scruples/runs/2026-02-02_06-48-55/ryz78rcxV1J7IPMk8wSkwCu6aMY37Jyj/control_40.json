Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made a statement about leaving their girlfriend if she gets pregnant is in the wrong. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are communication, respect, and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author states that they made a joke about their girlfriend not giving the baby away, which upset her. Then, after some back and forth, they told her flat out they'd leave if she got pregnant. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset, feeling betrayed and questioning the author's loyalty and views on women and responsibility. The author claims they love her but can't stand kids and don't want a child ruining their life or causing financial strain.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, honesty is important, but how it's communicated matters. Making a joke and then escalating to a definitive statement like \"I'll leave you if you get pregnant\" is a serious ultimatum. Even if the author has strong feelings against children, bringing up such a condition during a conversation about pregnancy is likely to be hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that this ultimatum breaches trust and respect. It's a significant commitment to have a child, and making such a decision unilaterally without considering her feelings and their relationship's future is problematic. The author's stance might be based on personal beliefs, but relationships require mutual respect and consideration for each other's desires and limits.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment about women and responsibilities could imply that they're placing the burden of pregnancy on her, which is a sensitive issue. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, the way they expressed it was harsh and dismissive of her feelings and their relationship's potential.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel they're being truthful, the manner and content of their statement likely caused unnecessary harm and disrespect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
