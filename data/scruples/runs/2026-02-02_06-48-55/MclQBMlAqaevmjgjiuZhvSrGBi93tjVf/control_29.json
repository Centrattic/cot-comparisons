However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. The author emphasizes that they respect their wife's bodily autonomy but changed their stance after researching the potential risks from cannabis during pregnancy. The wife is experiencing worsened morning sickness and uses weed as a remedy, but the author is concerned about the baby's health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main argument is that they did their due diligence by consulting a knowledgeable friend and researching reliable sources, which indicated risks. They approached the wife respectfully and she initially agreed. Now, the wife is struggling with her symptoms and feels the author is being too strict. The author is conflicted because they support autonomy but also want to protect the child.\n\nThe wife's counterargument is that she's already taking medications with risks, which her doctors say are minimal. She's unwilling to ask her OBGYN because she believes the doctor would say no. The author feels they have a right to be involved in the child's health, similar to how alcohol and cigarettes are typically off-limits.\n\nI should think about the ethical aspects. Autonomy is a big part of medical ethics, so the wife's right to make decisions about her body is important. However, there's also the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) concerning the unborn child. The author is trying to balance both, but where does that balance lie?\n\nLegally and ethically, pregnant individuals generally have the autonomy to make medical decisions unless there's a significant risk to the fetus, which might involve legal intervention. However, in most cases, the decision is left to the pregnant person. The author isn't forcing the wife to stop; they convinced her through discussion. Now, the wife is struggling with symptoms and using guilt, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's concern is valid, especially since recent studies might show risks. But if the wife's doctors haven't advised against cannabis and she finds it helpful, maybe the author should reconsider. However, the author's compromise was to suggest discussing it with the OBGYN, which the wife refused. That refusal might mean the author can't push further without overstepping.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to alcohol and cigarettes. Those substances have more established risks, so it's standard to avoid them. Cannabis's risks are less clear, but some studies suggest potential issues. The author's stance is based on the precautionary principle, which is reasonable but can be seen as overreach if the wife is using her judgment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one taking the substance, so their role is more about concern for the child. However, the final decision should rest with the pregnant person. The author's actions might be well-meaning but could infringe on the wife's autonomy if pushed too hard.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their concerns and trying to make an informed decision. They approached it respectfully and the wife agreed initially. However, the ongoing pressure from the wife and her refusal to consult the OBGYN might mean the author needs to reassess their approach. But since the author isn't forcing the issue and the wife is still making the choice, the author isn't clearly in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
