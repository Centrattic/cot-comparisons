However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the situation is about a pregnant wife smoking weed, and the husband is asking if he's at fault for not allowing her to do so to help with morning sickness. He believes in bodily autonomy but is concerned about the baby's health after some research. The wife is upset, feels her autonomy is being respected, and the husband is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the husband is overstepping by asking his wife not to use cannabis, even though she's using it to manage morning sickness. The husband's stance is based on recent research he found indicating risks to the baby. The wife, on the other hand, feels her autonomy is being violated, especially when there are other medications with minimal risks she's taking as prescribed by doctors. She also mentions her OBGYN is conservative, so she's not going to ask.\n\nI should think about bodily autonomy. Generally, individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, especially in medical contexts. But when a pregnancy is involved, there's a shared interest in the health of the fetus. The husband's concern is valid because he's trying to protect their child. However, he's also making a decision that affects his wife's autonomy. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's infringing on her autonomy without a sufficient reason, then he might be. But if he's acting in good faith based on his research and concern for the baby, maybe not. The fact that he tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, which she refused, adds complexity. Also, the comparison to alcohol or cigarettes is relevant because those substances are generally discouraged during pregnancy, but cannabis isn't as universally regulated. \n\nI need to consider the reliability of the sources he used. If his research is accurate, then his concern is justified. However, if he's misinterpreting the studies, that could be a problem. The wife's argument about other medications with minimal risks is a valid point. It's possible that the husband is prioritizing the potential risks of cannabis over the known effectiveness of her prescribed medications, which her doctors have deemed safe.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The wife's morning sickness is worsening, and she's using cannabis to manage it. If it's helping her, is it ethical to deny her that relief, especially if the evidence on cannabis isn't conclusive? The husband's guilt if something happens to the child is a heavy burden, but it's not his body, so the decision should ideally be hers, unless there's a legal or medical directive otherwise.\n\nIn many cases, the pregnant person is the one making medical decisions for themselves and the fetus, unless there's a legal intervention. So, even though the husband has a stake in the baby's health, he doesn't have the authority to override her medical choices. The fact that she's using something to manage her symptoms, which her doctors haven't prescribed, might influence this. If there's a lack of consensus in the medical community about cannabis safety, her autonomy should take precedence.\n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he's imposing his decisions on her body without her full medical consultation and against her doctors' recommendations (as far as they know). However, his intentions are good. But the core issue is autonomy. So, even with good intentions, if he's restricting her autonomy without a strong medical consensus, he's overstepping. Hence, answer A (he's in the wrong).\n"
