However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness.\n\nFirst, the husband initially supported his wife's autonomy but changed his stance after doing more research. He found studies suggesting risks from cannabis during pregnancy. The wife agrees to stop, but her morning sickness worsens, leading her to plead for using weed again. The husband is conflicted because he respects her autonomy but is concerned about the baby's health. \n\nKey points to consider: \n1. **Autonomy vs. Shared Decision-Making**: The wife's right to make decisions about her body versus their shared responsibility as parents.\n2. **Medical Advice**: The wife mentions that her doctors are prescribing medications with known risks, implying that controlled substances are used in her care. The husband suggests she consult her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking they'd say no.\n3. **Evidence-Based Concerns**: The husband's research points to potential cannabis risks, but the wife argues other medications are also risky. The husband's stance is similar to avoiding alcohol or cigarettes, which are clearly unsafe during pregnancy.\n4. **Emotional Impact**: The wife is struggling with morning sickness, which is a valid medical issue, and the husband's refusal is causing her distress.\n\nThe husband is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern. However, he's overriding his wife's autonomy and her medical needs without consulting her doctor. The wife's refusal to talk to the OBGYN complicates things further. The husband might be acting in good faith, but he's not allowing her to make an informed decision with medical guidance. So, while his intentions are protective, the method of denying her choice without professional input could be problematic. The answer depends on balancing autonomy with parental responsibility. Since the husband is making a decision that affects both the wife and the child, and the wife is experiencing medical issues, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not facilitating a medical consultation. But if the evidence is strong against cannabis, maybe not. However, the wife's autonomy is a key factor here. The husband's approach could be seen as undermining her agency, especially since she's already compliant and now in distress. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the autonomy issue and lack of medical consultation.\n"
