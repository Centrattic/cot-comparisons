However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author believes in his wife's bodily autonomy but changed his stance after researching and finding potential risks of cannabis during pregnancy. His friend, who is knowledgeable, made him take it seriously. He presented findings to his wife, who agreed initially. Now, she's experiencing worse morning sickness and wants to use weed again, but he's resisting. She's trying to guilt-trip him and mentions that her doctors allow other medications with minimal risks. The author feels conflicted because it's their child and he doesn't want to risk harm, but he's respecting her autonomy usually. \n\nSo, the key points here are autonomy, the husband's role, the medical advice, and the wife's health needs. \n\nFrom a legal and medical standpoint, cannabis use during pregnancy is generally discouraged due to potential risks, though it's not as strictly regulated as alcohol or tobacco. The wife's autonomy is a big factor here. The husband isn't forcing her but is asking her not to use it. He's given her the option to discuss with her OBGYN, which she refuses. \n\nThe wife's morning sickness is severe enough that she's considering cannabis as a remedy. If her doctors are okay with other medications, maybe there's a gap between her needs and the husband's concerns. The husband's actions come from a place of concern for the child, but he's also aware of her autonomy. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not preventing her from doing it; he's made a request based on his research. However, he's allowing her to feel guilty and is being persistent in his stance even when she's struggling. There's a balance between parental responsibility and respecting her medical decisions. Since the husband isn't forceful but is making a request, and the wife is autonomous, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But he's not considering her health needs and the doctor's advice. \n\nIn some states, medical marijuana is allowed for morning sickness, so maybe he's being too strict. Also, the wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN again could be an issue. The husband's compromise was a good step, but she's not taking it. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's acting on his research and concern for the baby, but there's a nuance. However, the main question is about being in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and is trying to protect the child, while respecting her body to some extent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that she's using other medications with minimal risk might imply that the husband's stance is inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, the wife's autonomy is a key factor here. If she's choosing to use cannabis as prescribed or allowed by her doctors, but the husband is against it, it's a conflict between parental rights. Since he's the one making the request, but not enforcing it, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the guilt-tripping and his persistence might be problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making an informed decision based on his research and concern for the baby's safety. However, he should consider her autonomy more and perhaps revisit the conversation with her OBGYN. But given the scenario, the answer is B.\n"
