However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. The author believes in women's autonomy over their bodies but is conflicted because he found some research indicating risks from cannabis during pregnancy. His wife agreed initially but now her morning sickness is worse, and she's trying to guilt him into allowing it again. He's trying to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the doctor would say no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about the balance between the husband's concern for the baby's health and his wife's autonomy. The husband's actions stem from a place of trying to protect their child, which is understandable. However, the wife is the one directly affected, and the decision to use cannabis is a personal medical choice. \n\nThe husband did his own research and found some studies showing risks, which he might believe are relevant. But the wife is on medications that doctors say are safe, and she's using cannabis as a way to manage her symptoms. The fact that she's experiencing worse morning sickness now and is using it as a coping mechanism adds complexity. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between paternal concern and personal autonomy. The husband is not forcing her; he's asking and she's resisting. He's tried to compromise by suggesting talking to the OBGYN, which is a reasonable step, but the wife thinks the doctor won't help. That's a problem in itself\u2014maybe she needs a different doctor who's more open to discussing such options.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The author is trying to respect his wife's autonomy but is concerned for the baby. The answer might depend on whether he's overstepping by making the decision for her, even if it's for the child's sake. Since it's her body and her medical decisions, unless there's a clear, widely accepted danger, it's her right to choose. However, the husband's intentions are good, and he's trying to act in the child's best interest. \n\nBut the key is that the wife is using it to manage her morning sickness, which is a valid medical concern. If the medical community is divided or there's no consensus, then the decision should rest with the patient. The husband's role is to support her, not to dictate. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's imposing his views, even if well-meaning, on her medical decisions. However, the situation is nuanced. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are protective and he's trying to find a middle ground. But another angle is that he's encroaching on her autonomy. \n\nI think the main point is that the wife is the one making the medical choices for her body, even if the husband is concerned. The husband should support her decision as long as it's her choice, even if he disagrees. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's trying to control her medical choices. But the wife agreed initially, so he did get her consent. However, later, she's changed her mind, and he's not allowing her to make that decision anymore. So the husband is not in the wrong because he's advocating for the baby's health, but he's also not forcing her. Wait, the wife is the one using guilt and begging, but the husband is trying to protect the child. It's a tough one. \n\nIn the end, the husband is trying to balance two things: his wife's autonomy and the child's safety. Since it's her body, the decision should be hers, but he's not forcing her. He's persuading her. The fact that she's on other medications with minimal risks but is using cannabis for morning sickness\u2014maybe the husband is overestimating the risk of cannabis compared to other medications. So he might be in the wrong for not trusting her medical judgment. Therefore, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted. The key is that the husband is not forcing her; he's asking. The wife is the one who's making the choice, even if she's struggling. The husband is trying to guide her, but it's her decision. So maybe he's not in the wrong. I'm torn. But given the principles of bodily autonomy, the answer is likely A.\n"
