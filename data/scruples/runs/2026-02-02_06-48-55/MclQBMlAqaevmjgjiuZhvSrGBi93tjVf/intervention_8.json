However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author initially wasn't against his wife smoking, thinking it was safe because of more research and social acceptance. Then a friend with more knowledge made him reconsider. He did his own research and found recent studies indicating risks to the baby. He talked to his wife, who agreed. Now she's struggling with morning sickness and wants to use weed, but he's holding his ground. She's trying to guilt him, bringing up other medications with low risks, but he's not budging. He's conflicted because he believes in her autonomy but also wants to protect the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They argue that while he's concerned, he's overriding her autonomy. But I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's intention is to protect the baby, which is understandable. He did his research and found risks. But women's autonomy over their bodies is a big factor here. Even if the research shows risks, it's the wife's body. Unless there's a medical professional advising against it, maybe the author shouldn't make that decision. However, he did suggest she consult her OBGYN, which she refuses. If she's not getting medical advice, he might have a point in terms of responsibility for the child's well-being. \n\nBut wait, the wife is already on other medications that her doctors say have minimal risks. If she's using those, why isn't the author opposing those? Maybe because he sees alcohol/cigarettes as worse, but cannabis is a gray area. The author's stance might be inconsistent here. Also, the wife's health and comfort during pregnancy are important. Morning sickness can be severe, and if cannabis helps, it's a tough call.\n\nThe author's argument that he has a say because it's their child might be valid, but it's ultimately her body. The line between concern and overstepping is thin. If he's not a medical professional, he shouldn't be dictating her medical choices, even if it's for the baby's sake. The autonomy angle is strong here. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy, even with his concern. On the other hand, if he's making a compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, and she refuses, maybe he's right in not allowing it because he can't be responsible if something happens. \n\nBut the key point is that the wife is the one making the choices for her body, even if it's for the baby's sake. The author's role is to support her, not to enforce his own research. Unless there's a legal or medical mandate, it's her right to decide. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because he's infringing on her autonomy without medical advice. Even if he's worried, he shouldn't take that decision away. The fact that she's trying to guilt-trip him might indicate he's being too strict, but that's part of the conflict. Overall, the balance favors the wife's autonomy, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
