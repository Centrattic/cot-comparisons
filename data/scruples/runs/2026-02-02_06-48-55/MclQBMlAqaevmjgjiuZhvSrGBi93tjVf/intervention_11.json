However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's wife is pregnant and uses weed for morning sickness. The author initially thought it was okay because they believed it was safe, but after talking to a friend and doing research, they found out there are risks. They told their wife, and she agreed to stop, but now her morning sickness is worse, and she's trying to guilt-trip him into letting her use again. She mentions other medications have risks too, but her doctors say they're minimal. The author is torn because he believes in bodily autonomy but also feels responsible for the child's safety. He's considering the child's well-being but also his wife's autonomy.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is based on new information he researched. He changed his mind after learning about the potential risks. That seems reasonable. People can update their beliefs with new evidence. But the issue is whether he's overstepping by asking his wife not to use weed when she's pregnant. Since it's her body, does he have the right to make that decision for her?\n\nHe mentions that if it were alcohol or cigarettes, there wouldn't be a discussion. Those are known to be harmful during pregnancy, so there's a societal consensus. Cannabis, however, is more controversial. Some states allow medical use, and the research isn't as conclusive as with alcohol or tobacco. The wife's argument is that other medications have risks but are approved by doctors. The author suggests she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, fearing a conservative response.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he wants to protect the child's well-being. But does he have the authority to override his wife's autonomy? In many ethical frameworks, bodily autonomy is a strong right, especially when the person is not a minor and the decision isn't illegal in their location. However, the author is a partner, not a legal guardian, so his input is advice, not a mandate.\n\nThe wife's worsening symptoms are a concern. If cannabis helps her manage morning sickness, and doctors haven't prohibited it, maybe the author should consider that. But the author's research suggests otherwise. There's a conflict between his concern and her medical needs.\n\nIs the author wrong for trying to influence her decision? It's a delicate balance. He's acting from a place of love and concern for the child. However, pressuring her to stop using cannabis when her doctors haven't explicitly condemned it might infringe on her autonomy. The fact that she's pregnant and they have mutual responsibility for the child complicates things. But legally and ethically, the decision should be hers unless there's a medical professional's explicit advice against it.\n\nIn the end, while the author's intentions are good, he might be overstepping by not respecting his wife's autonomy, especially if her doctors haven't taken a firm stance. The wife has the right to make her own medical decisions, even if it's a controversial choice. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not supporting her in discussing this with her OBGYN and instead unilaterally deciding against cannabis use without a clear medical directive.\n"
