However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband asked his pregnant wife not to smoke weed because of concerns about the baby's health. He mentions that he changed his mind after talking to a friend and doing some research. His wife agrees initially but then starts struggling with morning sickness and wants to use cannabis again. She argues that other medications have risks too, but her doctor says those are minimal. The husband feels conflicted because he supports body autonomy but also wants the best for the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's correct. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, a person's autonomy over their own body is a strong argument. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own health, even if her husband disagrees. The husband's concern is valid, but he's making a decision based on his interpretation of research, which might not be the same as medical advice. The wife is already under medical care, and her doctors haven't raised this issue, which could mean there's a different risk assessment.\n\nHowever, the husband's intentions are to protect the child, which is understandable. But the key point is that he's imposing his views on his wife without medical guidance. He tried to get her to talk to her OBGYN, but she refused. That shows he's making a judgment call, not following medical advice. Even if he believes the research, the medical community's stance is important here. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's dealing with morning sickness and seeking relief might be a valid reason for her. If other medications are prescribed and accepted by her doctors, but cannabis isn't, there's a discrepancy in risk perception. The husband's stance might be overstepping because he's not the one responsible for her health under medical supervision.\n\nSo, considering autonomy and the fact that he's making a decision not based on her doctors' advice, the husband might be in the wrong. The wife's right to make her own choices, even if they involve risks, is a personal matter. Unless there's a clear medical directive against cannabis, his interference could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
