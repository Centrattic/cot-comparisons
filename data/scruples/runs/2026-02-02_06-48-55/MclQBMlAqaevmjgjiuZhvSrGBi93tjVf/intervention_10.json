However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed. The writer believes in women's bodily autonomy but is conflicted because he researched and found potential risks from cannabis use during pregnancy. His wife agreed initially but now her morning sickness has worsened, leading her to want to use it again.\n\nHe's trying to balance her autonomy with his concern for the baby's safety. The wife is using other medications that her doctors say are low-risk, but she refuses to consult her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no. \n\nNow, considering bodily autonomy, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, the husband's argument is that it's also their child, so he has a stake in the decision. The key here is whether the husband overstepped by making a decision that affects her autonomy, even if his intentions are good. \n\nThere's a tension between autonomy and paternalistic concern. The husband did research and presented findings, which shows he tried to be informed. But by not allowing her to consult her OBGYN, he's not letting her make the decision with her medical provider. The wife is being denied the chance to discuss this with her doctor, which could be a violation of her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the husband's compromise was to suggest discussing it with the OBGYN, but she refused. Since the husband tried to involve medical advice but she didn't follow through, maybe the fault isn't entirely on him. However, the fact that he's now enforcing his decision without her input might still be an issue. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, alcohol and cigarettes are more clearly harmful, but cannabis's risks are less clear. The husband's stance might seem reasonable given the research, but the way he's handling it could infringe on her autonomy. The guilt-tripping and constant begging from the wife complicate things, but that doesn't justify overriding her choices without involving her medical team.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the husband's actions might be seen as well-intentioned but possibly overreaching. The wife's autonomy is a fundamental right, and even with good intentions, the husband's decision-making without her full medical consultation could be at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
