However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband asked his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. He mentions he believes in women's autonomy but is conflicted. He did some research after talking to a friend and found potential risks. The wife agreed initially but now her morning sickness has worsened, and she's trying to persuade him to let her use it again. She argues that other medications she's on have risks but her doctors say they're minimal. The husband tried to suggest she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the doctor would say no.\n\nThe husband is torn between his wife's autonomy and his concern for the child. He compares it to alcohol or cigarettes, which wouldn't be an issue, but marijuana is more complicated. He feels he has a say because it's their child.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, autonomy is a big factor here. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. The husband's concern is valid, especially if studies show risks, but he's not her doctor. The fact that her doctors have approved other medications with some risks suggests that medical decisions are complex. By making the decision for her, even if well-intentioned, he might be overstepping. However, he's also acting in the child's best interest. But since the wife is an adult and the decision is ultimately hers, the husband's role is more supportive. He should focus on supporting her in making her own informed choice rather than dictating it. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's infringing on her autonomy even if his intentions are good.\n"
