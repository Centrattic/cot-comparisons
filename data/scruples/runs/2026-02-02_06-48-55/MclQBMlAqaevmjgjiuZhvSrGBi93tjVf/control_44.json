However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband initially supported his wife's autonomy but changed his mind after doing more research. He found recent studies suggesting risks from cannabis use during pregnancy. His wife agreed at first, but her morning sickness worsened, and now she's begging to use it again. She mentions other medications with risks that doctors approved, and the husband is okay with her talking to her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor will say no. The husband feels conflicted between his concern for the baby's safety and respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of ethics, bodily autonomy is important. However, when it comes to a pregnancy, there's a consideration for the health of both the mother and the fetus. The husband isn't forcing her; he's asking her not to, and she agreed initially. But now she's struggling with morning sickness and wants to use it for relief. The OBGYN's stance is also a factor here. If the medical community generally advises against cannabis during pregnancy, then maybe the husband's concerns are valid. However, if some studies suggest it's safer than other medications, that complicates things. \n\nThe wife is using her autonomy to make a choice, and the husband is trying to protect the child. The husband's actions stem from concern, not coercion. But the problem arises when his refusal leads to her increased suffering. The husband is not forcing her but is setting a boundary. However, he's allowing her to make the final decision if she wants to discuss it with the OBGYN. \n\nIn many cases, the medical community does advise against cannabis use in pregnancy due to potential risks, even if some medications have their own risks. The husband's research aligns with that. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But the debate is about autonomy versus safety. Since the wife is the one making the choice, but the husband is advocating for the child's health, it's a balance. The husband isn't taking away her agency; he's presenting information and she agreed initially. The fact that she's trying to guilt him into letting her might indicate she feels pressured, but he's trying to be reasonable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's acting in good faith based on his research and concern for the child, even though there's a conflict with autonomy. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The key is that he's not forcing her but is trying to protect the baby, which is a shared responsibility.\n"
