However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. The wife is using it for morning sickness, and they had a friend who's knowledgeable about cannabis, leading them to research more. They found some studies indicating risks, so they asked her to stop. Now she's experiencing worse morning sickness and is pressuring him to let her use it again. She mentions that other medications she's on have risks too, but her doctors say they're minimal. He tried to suggest talking to her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor will say no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The husband believes in bodily autonomy but is concerned about the baby's health. On one hand, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. On the other hand, the husband is worried about the child's well-being. The key here is whether his actions infringe on her autonomy without sufficient justification.\n\nThe husband did his research after talking to a friend and found recent studies suggesting risks. However, the wife's doctors might have a different opinion, especially if they consider the minimal risks of other medications. The wife's refusal to consult the OBGYN complicates things because she's not getting professional medical advice, which could mean her belief that the OBGYN would say no isn't based on actual consultation.\n\nThe husband's compromise was to allow her to discuss it with her doctor, which is reasonable. But she's not taking that step, so he's left in a bind. The morning sickness is getting worse, which could lead to health issues for her. If the weed is helping manage that, stopping it might be causing more harm than good. However, the husband's concern is valid because he's worried about the baby. But is he overstepping by dictating her choices without medical advice?\n\nIn terms of autonomy, the wife has the right to make her own medical decisions, even if her husband disagrees. The husband's role is to support her, not to impose his own research findings. Unless there's a legal or medical directive that allows him to make such decisions, he's not in the right position to override her choices. Plus, the fact that she agrees initially but now is struggling might indicate that the decision isn't fully hers anymore under pressure. But the initial agreement is important.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. He's acting out of care for the child, but he's not the one who can make medical decisions for her. Unless there's a legal or medical authority backing his stance, he's stepping into her autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's infringing on her bodily autonomy without a clear medical necessity, especially since she's not consulting her doctor as he suggested.\n"
