However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey have a pregnant wife who uses weed for morning sickness. The author originally thought it was okay because they believed research showed it was safe. But after talking to a friend who's knowledgeable about cannabis science, they did more research and found recent studies indicating risks to the baby. They then asked their wife to stop, and she agreed. Now the morning sickness is worse, and she keeps trying to guilt-trip the author into letting her use it again. She mentions other medications with risks approved by her doctors, and the author suggested she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor would say no. The author is conflicted between supporting her autonomy and their concern for the child's safety.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they researched and found risks, so they asked their wife to stop. They acknowledge her autonomy but are worried about the child's welfare. They compare it to alcohol or cigarettes, which are definitely not allowed during pregnancy. The wife is using a different method to manage her symptoms, but the author is concerned about the potential harm.\n\nOn the flip side, the wife's side is about her autonomy and the fact that her doctors have approved other medications. The author is making a decision that affects her health and her treatment of morning sickness. The wife is in a vulnerable state, and the author is imposing a restriction that might be affecting her well-being.\n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, the pregnant person has the right to make decisions about their body. Even if a partner is involved, the final decision often rests with the person carrying the pregnancy. The author's role here is supportive rather than authoritative. By stopping her from using something that helps with her symptoms, especially when her medical team hasn't prohibited it, the author might be overstepping. However, the author is acting out of concern for the child's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut where is the line between support and overreach? The wife is seeking medical advice but is being dissuaded by the author. If the author is preventing her from discussing it with her doctor, that could be problematic. The wife's refusal to consult the OBGYN might be because she thinks the doctor will say no, but the author's suggestion should be to let her make that decision. The author's actions could be infringing on her autonomy, even if well-intentioned.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. paternalism. The author is acting in what they believe is the best interest of the child, but they might not be respecting the wife's medical decisions. Morning sickness can be severe, and if cannabis is helping her manage it, and her doctors haven't forbidden it, the author's intervention might be inappropriate. The author's compromise (suggesting she talk to the OBGYN) is good, but by not allowing her to do so if she's scared of the answer, they're not supporting her in making an informed choice.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong (A) because they are overriding their wife's autonomy in a medical decision that her doctors haven't prohibited, even if they have concerns. The wife's right to choose her treatment, given the lack of absolute contraindications, is more important than the author's preferences, even if well-meaning.\n"
