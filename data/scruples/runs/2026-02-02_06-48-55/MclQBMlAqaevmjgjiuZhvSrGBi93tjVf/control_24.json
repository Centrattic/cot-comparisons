However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed during her pregnancy. The key points here are about autonomy, the safety of cannabis during pregnancy, and the husband's reasoning.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions he's pro-woman's autonomy but is conflicted because he found research suggesting risks from cannabis. His friend, who's knowledgeable, made him reconsider. He talked to his wife, she agreed at first, but now she's struggling with morning sickness and wants to use it again. She's trying to guilt him, comparing it to other medications her doctors approved. The husband tried to suggest she talk to her OBGYN, but she won't because she thinks the doctor won't approve. He feels he's not wrong since it's their child, but it's against her autonomy.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, autonomy is a big factor. If the wife is an adult and capable of making her own decisions, especially about her body, then the husband pushing his views might be overstepping. Even if he's concerned, her right to make medical decisions for herself (with her doctor's guidance) is important. Plus, she's using it to manage morning sickness, which is a valid health issue. The fact that she's been trying to guilt him into letting her use it suggests she feels her autonomy is being restricted. Also, the husband's compromise of suggesting she talk to her OBGYN isn't being used, so maybe he should respect her decision even if he disagrees. Comparing it to alcohol or cigarettes is a common argument, but those have clearer guidelines. Cannabis's effects are still debated, so it's a gray area. However, the husband shouldn't override her medical choices once she's made an informed decision. So the answer might be A, meaning he's in the wrong because he's infringing on her autonomy despite his good intentions.\n"
