However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant wife who uses weed for morning sickness, and the husband is asking her to stop because he found research suggesting it's risky. The wife is struggling with morning sickness and wants to use it as a remedy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's trying to be supportive but is concerned about the baby's health. He mentions that he researched and found risks, so he's acting on that information. However, the wife has autonomy over her body, which he acknowledges. He's in a tough spot because he's trying to balance his wife's autonomy with the potential risks to their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is relying on the husband's support during a tough time. Her morning sickness is getting worse, and she's using weed as a way to cope. She's also pointing out that other medications she's on have some risks but are approved by her doctors. The husband tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor will say no. That's a problem because the husband isn't getting that medical advice directly from the doctor.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus the child's well-being. The husband is trying to protect the child, which is understandable, but he's making a decision that affects his wife's autonomy. The wife is in a vulnerable position with morning sickness, and the husband's denial might be adding stress. Also, the husband's friend and his own research might not be the most reliable sources compared to medical professionals. The fact that the wife refuses to consult her OBGYN is concerning because that's a more authoritative source.\n\nThe husband's argument that if it were alcohol or cigarettes there wouldn't be a discussion is valid in the sense that those substances are more strictly advised against during pregnancy. However, cannabis is a gray area with varying legal and medical opinions. The husband's position is based on his interpretation of the research, but without the wife consulting her doctor, it's hard to say if he's making the right call. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The husband isn't forcing her; he's asking her to stop. The wife agreed initially but now is struggling. The husband's concern is valid, but his refusal to allow her to seek medical advice from her OBGYN might be an issue. The wife's autonomy is important, and if her doctors have approved other medications with known risks, maybe the husband's stance is overstepping, especially without medical support. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's acting on his concerns for the child's health, but the wife's autonomy is also a factor. However, since the husband isn't forcing her and is trying to protect the child, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's denying her a medically supported option without consulting her doctor, that could be an issue. The fact that she's not consulting her OBGYN might mean the husband doesn't have full information. But since he's acting in good faith, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
