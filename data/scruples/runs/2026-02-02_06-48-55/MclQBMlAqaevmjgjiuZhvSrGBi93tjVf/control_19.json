However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed. The husband initially thought it was safe but did more research and found risks. He talked to his wife, who agreed, but her morning sickness got worse, and she's now guilt-tripping him. She argues that other medications have risks but her doctors say they're minimal. He tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, saying the doctor would be conservative.\n\nFirst, the husband is trying to protect the baby, which is a natural instinct. He based his decision on researching the risks, even though he's not an expert. The wife's autonomy is a key point here. The husband acknowledges that normally he supports her bodily autonomy, but this is about their child's health. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is using medical marijuana to manage morning sickness, which her doctors have approved despite the risks. She feels her autonomy is being infringed. The husband's compromise was to consult the OBGYN, but she won't. That might mean he's not entirely wrong, but is the refusal to seek medical advice a problem?\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The AITA subreddit often considers intentions and context. The husband's intention is to protect their child, which is understandable. However, forcing her to stop might conflict with her medical decisions, even if he's acting out of love. The wife's actions are based on her medical advice, and the husband is overriding that. \n\nBut the husband did research, found risks, and discussed it with her. She initially agreed. Now she's struggling with symptoms and feels the need to use it again. The husband's position could be seen as overstepping because he's not the medical authority, and the OBGYN hasn't ruled it out. So, is he wrong for not letting her seek a medical opinion? Maybe not. But he's limiting her choice based on his research, not her doctor's. That might be where he's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, since he suggested she talk to the doctor and she refused, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if she's already under medical care, the final decision should be between her and her doctor. The husband shouldn't be the one making that call unless there's a legal or serious health issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to protect the baby, but there's a nuance. However, the AITA community might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's restricting her autonomy without a medical authority's input. The key is that the wife's doctors haven't prohibited it, so the husband's decision might be crossing a line. Therefore, the answer could be A.\n"
