However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness. The wife initially agreed but now her symptoms are worse, and she's starting to beg and guilt-trip the author.\n\nFirst, the author's position is based on research they did after talking to a friend. They found that cannabis use during pregnancy has risks, so they tried to convince their wife to stop. The wife agreed at first but then the situation changed. Now she's using other medications with minimal risks as per doctors, but she refuses to consult her OBGYN about cannabis because she thinks they'll say no due to being conservative.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes the child being their mutual responsibility and the fear of regret if something goes wrong. They also mention that if it were alcohol or cigarettes, it wouldn't be a debate. However, they acknowledge the wife's autonomy, which is a key point here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is acting out of concern for the child's health, which is a valid parental concern. On the other hand, the wife's autonomy over her body is important. The author might be overstepping by making a decision that affects her health, even if they think it's for the best. The wife could see this as undermining her trust and autonomy, especially since she's already agreed and now feels pressured again. The fact that she's using other medications prescribed by doctors adds complexity, as those are vetted even if they have some risks.\n\nThe author's friend's input might not be reliable, even if the friend is knowledgeable. Relying solely on a friend's advice and online sources instead of a medical professional could be an issue. The wife's OBGYN is the expert here, and the author suggests she consult them, but she refuses. So, the author's approach is to find a compromise by suggesting medical consultation, which is reasonable. However, the wife's refusal might be based on prior experiences, but the author could still support her in discussing it with the doctor, even if the doctor is conservative. The author also mentions guilt-tripping, which is emotionally manipulative and could be seen as wrong.\n\nThe core issue is the balance between parental responsibility and personal autonomy. The author is trying to protect the child, which is a common concern, but the wife's right to make her own medical decisions is significant. Since the author initially supported her autonomy but later changed their stance based on their own research, there might be a conflict of trust. The author's guilt over the child's health is understandable, but pushing the wife to stop might not be the right approach if her healthcare providers haven't addressed it. \n\nI think the author's intentions are good, but the execution might be problematic. They should respect their wife's autonomy and rely on medical advice rather than their own research. The wife's doctors are the ones who can assess her situation and make a recommendation. The author's insistence without involving the OBGYN could be seen as taking control away from her, even if it's with good intentions. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
