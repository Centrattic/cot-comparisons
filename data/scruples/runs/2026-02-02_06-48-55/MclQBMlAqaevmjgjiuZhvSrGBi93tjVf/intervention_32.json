However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. The husband believes in women's autonomy over their bodies but changed his mind after doing more research. His wife agreed at first but now her morning sickness is worse and she wants to use it again. She brings up that other medications she's on have risks too.\n\nHmm, first, the husband's stance is about the child's safety. He's citing recent research that shows risks, which he found credible. But the wife's autonomy is a big point here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide for myself. \n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to protect the baby, which is understandable. Parents often make decisions based on what they think is best for their child. But on the other hand, the wife has the right to make choices about her own body, especially if her doctors are okay with other medications. The fact that she's using it to manage morning sickness, which is a real and sometimes debilitating condition, adds complexity. \n\nThe husband's compromise was to suggest talking to the OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor will say no. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The wife might feel that her needs aren't being heard, and the husband might feel pressured or even guilt-tripped. \n\nIt's important to consider consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. The husband initiated a discussion and the wife initially agreed, but now she's struggling with the side effects. If the OBGYN could provide a balanced view, that might help, but the wife is resistant. \n\nIs the husband overstepping by not allowing her to use weed, even if it's a personal choice? Or is he acting in the best interest of the child? There's a balance between autonomy and shared responsibility. Since pregnancy affects both partners, they have to make joint decisions sometimes. However, autonomy is a significant factor here. \n\nI think the husband is trying to do the right thing but might not be considering his wife's well-being enough. The fact that she's relying on it for morning sickness, which her doctors might not have addressed, could mean the husband isn't fully supportive of her needs. He's prioritizing the child's safety but maybe not enough on her health. \n\nSo, considering autonomy and the fact that the wife's doctors have approved other medications with risks, the husband might be overstepping by denying her choice without medical guidance. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's restricting her autonomy without medical consultation, especially since the OBGYN's opinion isn't being sought due to her own beliefs.\n"
