However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed despite her autonomy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband initially thought weed was safe based on social acceptance and some research but later changed his mind after consulting a friend and doing more research. He found studies indicating risks, so he asked his wife to stop. She agreed but later feels worse with morning sickness and wants to use it again. He's compromising by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor would say no.\n\nThe husband is torn between respecting her autonomy and protecting the child. The wife is using guilt and the argument that other medications have risks. The husband's reasoning is that if it were alcohol or cigarettes, there wouldn't be a discussion, but cannabis is in a gray area. \n\nI should consider the context of medical advice. The wife's doctors have approved her current medications as low risk, but she's avoiding discussing cannabis with her OBGYN. The husband is trying to balance his own beliefs with his responsibility as a partner and future parent. \n\nAutonomy is important, but so is the well-being of the child. However, the decision should ideally be made with medical guidance. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a request based on his research and concerns. The wife is the one using it as a tool to pressure him. \n\nIs the husband overstepping? Maybe, but he's not making her stop; he's trying to persuade her. The fact that she's pregnant and wants to use cannabis for morning sickness adds complexity. Some studies show possible risks, but the evidence might not be as clear as with alcohol or tobacco. \n\nThe husband's stance is that he can't forgive himself if something happens. That's a valid emotional response. But he's allowing her to choose, just urging her to consider the risks. The key is whether he's infringing on her autonomy by asking her not to use it. Since he's not compelling her and she's still the one making the choice, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's sharing information, expressing concern, and not forcing her. The wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN complicates things, but the husband's actions are within the bounds of a concerned partner.\n"
