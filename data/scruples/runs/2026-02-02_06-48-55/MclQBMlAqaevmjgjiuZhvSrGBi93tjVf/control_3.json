However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author advising his pregnant wife not to smoke weed despite her autonomy concerns and her use of it to manage morning sickness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author initially supported his wife's autonomy but changed his stance after researching and finding potential risks. He approached her with this information, and she agreed. However, her morning sickness worsened, and she's now pressuring him to let her use it again. The author feels conflicted because he values her autonomy but also wants to protect their child.\n\nThe main factors here are autonomy vs. paternalism, the reliability of the research he cited, and the wife's medical advice. The author's reasoning is that cannabis might harm the baby, similar to alcohol or cigarettes. However, he acknowledges that his wife's doctors have approved her medications with minimal risks. She refuses to consult her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no due to being conservative.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. Autonomy is a big part of medical ethics, so the wife's right to make her own decisions about her body is important. However, the author's concern is for the child's wellbeing, which is also valid. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the decision for her, even though they initially agreed.\n\nAlso, the author's friend's input and his own research might not be as reliable as medical professionals. The fact that the wife isn't consulting her OBGYN could mean the author's advice is conflicting with professional medical guidance. But the wife's doctors have approved other medications, which adds another layer.\n\nThe author's compromise was to suggest consulting the OBGYN, which the wife refused. That might have been the best approach, but since she didn't take it, the author's stance is now based on his own understanding. The dilemma here is whether he has the right to enforce this decision without medical support.\n\nIn medical ethics, the principle of beneficence (acting in the best interest of the patient) is important, but so is autonomy. The author is trying to act in the baby's best interest, but that could infringe on the mother's autonomy. It's a tough balance. The fact that the wife is using cannabis to manage severe morning sickness is a significant factor here, as untreated symptoms could also be harmful.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because he's acting out of concern for the child. But he's also taking away her autonomy, which is a key right. However, since they initially agreed, and she's since changed her stance, maybe the author's persistence isn't entirely wrong. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are seen as overstepping or if they're justified due to the child's wellbeing. I think it's a nuanced case where neither is entirely in the wrong, but the author's actions might be justified given the potential risks, even though he's limiting autonomy. However, the wife's autonomy is a strong factor. But since the author's research led him to a conclusion and they both agreed, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife's current situation is causing harm (worse morning sickness), the author's refusal might lead to negative consequences. It's a tough call. Maybe B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to act in the child's interest based on his understanding, even if it's conflicting with autonomy.\n"
