However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife to stop smoking weed to help with morning sickness. The author supports body autonomy but is conflicted because they found studies suggesting risks to the baby. The wife is using cannabis to manage morning sickness, and her condition has worsened after stopping. She's pushing to use it again, arguing that other medications have risks but are approved by doctors. The author tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's stance is that they respect their wife's autonomy but are concerned about the child's safety. On one hand, the wife has the right to make decisions about her body, and cannabis might be her way to cope with pregnancy symptoms. On the other hand, the author is prioritizing the child's well-being based on their research, even though there's a lack of consensus or definitive evidence on cannabis safety during pregnancy.\n\nThe wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN is a point of contention. The author suggested a compromise, but the wife doesn't take it up, which could indicate she's aware the doctor might not support it. This makes the author's position more complex. If the author is making a unilateral decision without medical backing, is that overstepping? However, they did seek information and tried to involve the wife's healthcare provider, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to alcohol or cigarettes, which are clearly discouraged during pregnancy. Cannabis is in a gray area, with varying legal and medical stances. The wife uses it as a coping mechanism, and the author is trying to balance their values with their concern for the child. The author's guilt if something happens is a strong motivator, which is understandable but might infringe on the wife's autonomy.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions respect the wife's autonomy while addressing the child's safety. The author acted on their interpretation of research and communicated with the wife, who agreed initially. However, the wife's medical needs and the lack of consensus on cannabis safety complicate things. The author's insistence might not consider the wife's specific medical circumstances and her doctors' perspectives. Since the wife is using the medication under medical guidance for other medications, the author's decision could be seen as overreaching, especially if the OBGYN isn't consulted. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not allowing the wife to make her own decision with her healthcare provider's input, despite their good intentions.\n"
