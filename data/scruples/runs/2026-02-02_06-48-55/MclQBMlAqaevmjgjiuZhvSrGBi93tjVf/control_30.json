However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed. The wife has morning sickness, and she uses cannabis to help with it. The husband did some research and found potential risks, so he asked her to stop. Now she's struggling with her symptoms and is pressuring him to allow it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's autonomy versus the husband's concern for the baby's safety. The author mentions his belief in women's autonomy, which is a key point. However, he's also concerned about the child's well-being. The wife is using cannabis for morning sickness, which isn't a trivial issue. She's trying to manage her symptoms, which can be really challenging during pregnancy.\n\nThe husband did some research and found conflicting information. Initially, he thought cannabis was safe, but after learning from a friend and further research, he changed his mind. He approached his wife, and she agreed to stop, but her symptoms worsened. Now she's using guilt and arguments about other medications with minimal risks to push back. The husband's compromise was suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, which she refuses because she thinks the doctor will say no.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, cannabis use during pregnancy is a gray area. Medical advice is crucial here. The wife's doctors might have a different opinion, but she's not seeking their input, possibly due to stigma or the doctor's conservative stance. The husband is in a tough spot because it's their child, and he feels responsible for the child's safety. But he also respects his wife's autonomy.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife's autonomy is important, but so is the child's health. The husband isn't forcing her to stop; he's asking her not to use cannabis based on his research. However, she's now in a difficult situation with morning sickness and feels he's not supporting her. The husband's decision is based on his interpretation of the risks, but he might not have the full medical picture. The wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN complicates things because the doctor's advice could be more authoritative than the husband's research.\n\nSo, the dilemma here is between respecting the wife's autonomy and the husband's concern for the child's safety. The husband isn't forcing her, but he's influencing her decision based on his findings. The wife's health and comfort are also important. The answer depends on whether the husband overstepped by not allowing her to seek medical advice or by not considering the impact of his decision on her well-being. The wife's autonomy is a strong argument for the husband being in the wrong, but the child's safety is on the other side. It's a tough call. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's acting in good faith, but maybe he could have handled it differently by supporting her in seeking medical advice instead of making the decision himself. Alternatively, if the wife's doctors say it's safe, then the husband might be overstepping. But since she's not consulting them, it's unclear. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to protect the child, but there's a strong case for A (in the wrong) because of autonomy and lack of medical consultation. Hmm.\n"
