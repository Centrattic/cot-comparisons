However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed during her pregnancy, even though he respects her autonomy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The husband found out through his research that cannabis use during pregnancy might have risks, even if it's more socially acceptable now. He approached his wife and she agreed initially. But now her morning sickness is worse, and she wants to use weed to help, even though he's against it. She's using guilt and arguments about other medications with risks. The husband is conflicted because he believes in her autonomy but also cares about the child's safety.\n\nOn one hand, the wife has the right to make decisions about her body. If her doctors have approved other medications, maybe she feels cannabis is the only thing that helps her. But the husband is trying to protect the child, which is a valid concern. He's not forcing her to stop, but he's asking her not to. The compromise he suggested was talking to the OBGYN, but she's reluctant because she thinks the doctor is conservative.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not stopping her from using it; he's making a request based on his research. The key point is autonomy versus shared responsibility for the child. Since it's their child, maybe both have a say. But does that mean he should override her choice? Or is he respecting her autonomy by not forcing her but trying to find a middle ground?\n\nThe wife's argument about other medications with risks is a point. If other treatments are allowed, why not this? But maybe the risks of those are considered lower or more studied. The husband's research might show cannabis has higher risks. But without the OBGYN's input, it's hard to say. However, she's refusing to consult her doctor, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is important, but so is beneficence\u2014acting in the best interest of the child. The husband is trying to balance both. Since he's not using force or control, just trying to persuade, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he's overstepping by not allowing her to make her own choice once she's informed. But then again, the child's safety is a shared concern.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's making an informed request based on research, respects her autonomy, and isn't forcing her. He's trying to protect the child while acknowledging her rights. The fact that he compromised by suggesting a doctor's consultation shows he's trying to find a solution. His actions are motivated by concern for the child, which is valid.\n"
