However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness. The author mentions his belief in bodily autonomy but feels conflicted because he found recent studies showing risks from cannabis use during pregnancy. His wife initially agreed but now has worse morning sickness and is pushing for the use of weed, citing other medications with minimal risks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's wife has autonomy over her body, which is a key point. However, the author is also concerned about the child's well-being. The dilemma here is balancing individual rights with the potential harm to the fetus. The author did some research and found risks, which he shared with his wife. She agreed at first but now is struggling with her symptoms.\n\nAnother angle is the medical perspective. The wife's doctors have approved the medications she's on, which have minimal risks. She refuses to consult her OBGYN about cannabis, thinking they'll be conservative. The author tried to suggest consulting the doctor, which is a responsible step. But the wife isn't taking that advice, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, the pregnant person is the one who makes medical decisions for the fetus. However, the fetus is not a legal person, so the mother's autonomy is paramount. The author is trying to influence based on research, but ultimately, the decision should be hers. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's trying to protect the child, but he's also overriding his wife's autonomy. The question is whether his actions are justified. If the research shows significant risks, maybe he's justified in his concern. But if the wife's doctor hasn't mentioned cannabis as a problem, perhaps he's overstepping.\n\nThe key here is the balance between the author's concern for the child and his wife's rights. Since the author is not the one carrying the child and isn't the legal decision-maker, his role is more advisory. The wife's doctors are the ones who should be making medical recommendations. The author's actions might be well-intentioned but could be infringing on her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the wife is using her symptoms to plead for using weed, which is a different issue. The author feels pressured to give in despite his reservations. The situation is complex because both parties have valid concerns\u2014his fear for the child's safety and her need for symptom relief.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the author is seeking validation on whether his actions are reasonable. The community often looks at intentions and whether the person overstepped. Here, the author tried to compromise but the wife isn't engaging with the suggested solution (consulting the doctor). His actions might be seen as respecting her autonomy initially but now he's being controlling, which could be seen as the problem.\n\nGiven all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions violate his wife's autonomy without sufficient medical backing. Since he's not the one making the medical decision and the wife's doctors haven't addressed cannabis, the author might be in the wrong for overriding her choice based on his own research. Thus, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
