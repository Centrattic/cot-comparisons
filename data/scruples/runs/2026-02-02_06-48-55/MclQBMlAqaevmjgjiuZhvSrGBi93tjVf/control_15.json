However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed during her pregnancy. The situation is a bit complex because it involves personal autonomy, medical advice, and the couple's differing views on cannabis use.\n\nFirst, the author initially thought it was okay for his wife to continue using cannabis because he believed it was safe. But after some research and a conversation with a knowledgeable friend, he changed his mind and approached his wife about it. She agreed at first but now her morning sickness is worse, and she's using the weed to cope. The author is conflicted because he values her autonomy but also wants to protect their child. He tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the doctor would say no.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, the wife's autonomy is important. She has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if it's controversial. The husband is imposing his beliefs, which might not be his place. On the other hand, the child's health is a shared concern. The husband is worried about potential risks, and he's acting out of concern for the baby. The fact that she's using guilt and frequent requests to smoke might make the husband feel he's being manipulated, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are consent and medical advice. The wife's doctors haven't addressed the cannabis use, and she refuses to bring it up. The husband's research might not be as reliable as he thinks, especially if he's not a medical professional. The studies he found could have biases or be inconclusive. Also, comparing cannabis to alcohol or cigarettes isn't entirely fair because their legal and social statuses are different. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband is trying to protect the child but might be overstepping by not allowing her to consult her own doctor. The wife's autonomy is a significant factor here. Even if the husband's intentions are good, he's making a decision that affects her health and well-being. It's possible that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's acting in the child's best interest, but he might also be infringing on her autonomy. However, since they had a conversation and she initially agreed, maybe he's not entirely wrong. The situation is a tough spot, and both sides have valid points. But in terms of right or wrong, the husband's actions are a matter of opinion. The answer likely depends on how one weighs autonomy versus protection of the child.\n"
