However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. The author believes in women's autonomy but is conflicted because they found new research suggesting risks. The wife is experiencing worsened morning sickness and wants to use cannabis, but the author won't let her. She's bringing up other medications with risks that her doctors approved, and she doesn't want to ask her OBGYN because the author thinks they'd say no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's stance is based on new research indicating potential risks. They approached the wife with this information and she initially agreed. However, the wife is now struggling with morning sickness and feels the author is being restrictive. The author is conflicted because they respect autonomy but also want to protect the child.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to protect the baby's health, which is a valid concern. They did their research and tried to present the information to the wife. On the other hand, the wife is making autonomous decisions about her body, and the author is limiting her choice despite her doctors allowing other medications with risks. The wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN might also be a factor, but the author could have encouraged her to do so even if they think the doctor would say no.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Since the wife is pregnant, the author has a stake in the child's well-being, but so does the wife. The author's compromise was to suggest talking to the OBGYN, which the wife refused. The author's position might be seen as respecting her autonomy if they had supported her decision after the discussion with the doctor, but since she didn't pursue that, the author might feel justified. However, the wife's current health and autonomy are also important. The author's insistence without medical consensus might infringe on her rights. So, it's a tough balance. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as protective or controlling. Considering the wife's health and the fact that other medications with risks are allowed, the author's stance could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
