However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a pregnant wife who uses weed for morning sickness, and the husband is asking her not to. The husband initially thought it was okay but changed his mind after more research. Now he's conflicted between respecting her autonomy and wanting to protect the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The husband believes in bodily autonomy, which is a strong principle. But he also has concerns about the baby's health. The key here is whether his actions are interfering with her autonomy without sufficient justification.\n\nThe wife is using cannabis to manage morning sickness, which is a medical issue. Her doctors have approved other medications with known risks, so she might feel that cannabis is a necessary alternative. The husband's friend and his own research led him to question the safety of cannabis during pregnancy. However, he's aware that the research isn't conclusive, and there's a possibility of other factors affecting the studies.\n\nHe approached her with the information, and she agreed to stop initially. But her condition worsened, leading to her seeking alternatives. She refuses to consult her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no. The husband is now caught in a dilemma between his concern for the baby and her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is acting out of care for the child's well-being. But he's also making a decision that affects his wife's health and autonomy. The line between support and overstepping might be thin here. Since the wife is an adult and the decision involves her body, unless there's a medical consensus against cannabis use, the husband might be overstepping by not allowing her to make her own choice, especially when doctors are okay with other medications.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using guilt-tripping and compromise (suggesting consulting OBGYN) which she rejects shows that he's trying to find a middle ground. However, her refusal to discuss it with her doctor might be a valid point, but it's her choice. The husband's insistence could be seen as imposing his will, especially if the evidence isn't clear-cut.\n\nSo, considering autonomy and the potential risks, if the medical community isn't in agreement, the husband's actions might be seen as infringing on her rights. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But if the evidence clearly shows harm, maybe not. However, since he's relying on his interpretation of studies and his friend's opinion, not medical advice, it's not a solid basis. Hence, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
