However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. They think the author is wrong but want my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband supports bodily autonomy but changed his stance after more research. He found studies suggesting risks of cannabis during pregnancy, so he asked his wife to stop. She agreed initially but now experiences worse morning sickness and is pressuring him to let her use it again. She points out that other meds have risks but are approved by doctors. The husband suggests she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the doctor will be conservative.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. the health of the baby. The husband respects autonomy but is concerned about the child. The wife is using the medication to manage morning sickness. So, is the husband overstepping? \n\nIn terms of autonomy, the wife has the right to make decisions about her body. However, the husband is concerned about the child's well-being. The ethical dilemma is balancing individual rights with the welfare of the unborn child. \n\nThe husband's argument is that if it were alcohol or cigarettes, there'd be no debate. But cannabis is a gray area. Medical guidelines might vary. If the wife's doctors are okay with other medications but not cannabis, there's a conflict. The wife's refusal to consult her doctor complicates things. \n\nThe husband's intention is to protect the child, which is understandable. But by not allowing her to use something that helps her manage symptoms, he might be contributing to her distress. The wife's health and comfort are also important. \n\nIn many societies, pregnant individuals are encouraged to avoid substances with known risks, even if the evidence is conflicting. However, the autonomy aspect is significant. The husband's approach might be well-meaning but could infringe on her autonomy, especially if there's no conclusive evidence against cannabis in her case. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband's intervention is justified. If the risk is real and the alternative is effective, maybe he's right. But if the risk is uncertain and the wife's well-being is at stake, he's wrong. Given that the wife is seeking relief and the husband is imposing his views without medical approval, it's a tough call. \n\nI think the husband is trying to balance both sides, but his insistence without medical consensus might be overstepping. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the risk is real, maybe B (not in the wrong). Need to check medical guidelines. Since the wife's doctor isn't consulted and the husband's friend's advice is the basis, maybe the husband is relying on incomplete info. Therefore, A.\n"
