However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant wife using weed for morning sickness, and the husband is asking her not to. He believes in bodily autonomy but changed his mind after researching and finding potential risks. The wife's morning sickness is getting worse, and she wants to use cannabis again, but he's against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles involved. The husband supports his wife's autonomy, which is important. But he's also concerned about the child's safety. The wife is using it to manage morning sickness, which is a legitimate medical issue. However, the husband found research suggesting risks from cannabis during pregnancy. \n\nThe wife is using other medications that her doctors say have minimal risks, but she can't talk to her OBGYN about cannabis because she thinks they'll say no. So she's in a tough spot. The husband's compromise was to suggest consulting the OBGYN, but she refuses. \n\nIs the husband overstepping? He's making a decision about her body. Even if it's for the child's sake, does that justify overriding her autonomy? The wife is an adult and capable of making her own choices, even if they involve some risk. The husband might feel protective, but it's her body and her pregnancy. \n\nAlso, the comparison to alcohol and cigarettes is relevant because those have clear risks, but cannabis is more of a gray area. The husband's research might not be as solid as he thinks, and the wife's doctors might have different information. \n\nSo, the husband's intentions are good, but he's infringing on her autonomy. The key issue is whether he has the right to make that decision for her, even if it's for their child. I think the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy, even if his concerns are valid. The answer would be A.\n"
