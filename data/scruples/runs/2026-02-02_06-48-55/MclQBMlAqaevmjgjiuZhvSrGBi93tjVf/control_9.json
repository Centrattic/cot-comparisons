However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife to stop smoking weed during pregnancy. They mention their belief in bodily autonomy but changed their stance after more research.\n\nFirst, the husband's concern is about the baby's health. He did research and found potential risks with cannabis in pregnancy. His friend, who's knowledgeable, also mentioned risks. So, he's acting on what he believes is in the child's best interest. That's reasonable, right?\n\nBut then, the wife's morning sickness has gotten worse without the weed. She uses it to manage that, and she's asking him to reconsider. She brings up that other meds have risks too, but the doctors say they're minimal. She also refuses to ask her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no. So, her position is that she's making a choice she believes is best for herself, even if it's against her husband's wishes.\n\nThe husband is torn between his wife's autonomy and his responsibility as a father. He's not forcing her, he's asking. He's trying to protect the child. But is that overstepping? The key here is consent and mutual agreement. They initially agreed, but now she's struggling. He's not preventing her from using it; he's just asking her not to. But she's resistant. He's also considering the child's well-being, which is valid. However, her autonomy as a pregnant person is significant. \n\nThere's a balance between the two. The husband isn't outright forcing her to stop, but he's making a request based on his research. The wife is in a vulnerable state with morning sickness, and the cannabis helps her. If the doctors haven't prohibited it, maybe the husband's stance is more about his own fears than medical advice. Also, the wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN is a point\u2014maybe she's right they might be conservative, but the husband suggested it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, bodily autonomy is a big factor. The husband's concern for the child is valid, but he's not the one who has to make the medical decisions for himself. The wife's right to manage her own health, even with risks, is important. So maybe the husband is overstepping by not allowing her to make that choice, even if it's against his wishes. But he's also trying to protect the child. It's a tough call. However, since he's not forcing her and she's the one making the decision, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Wait, but he's pressuring her not to use it. The initial agreement was mutual, but now she's struggling. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because he's expressing concern and they had mutual agreement, but the wife's autonomy is still key. Alternatively, if he's pressuring her beyond her comfort, maybe A. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her, but suggesting, and both are considering risks, maybe B is correct.\n"
