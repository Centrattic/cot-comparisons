However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness, even though he initially supported her autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband changed his stance after talking to a friend and doing more research, finding potential risks from cannabis during pregnancy. He approached the wife, and she agreed to stop. Now, her morning sickness is worse, and she's asking him to let her use it again, citing medications with known risks. He's conflicted because of their child's well-being but also respects her bodily autonomy.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, bodily autonomy is a big factor. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, the husband is also concerned about the child's health. But he did present his arguments and she initially agreed. Now she's struggling, and he's not allowing her to use weed even though she finds it helpful. The compromise he suggested was talking to her OBGYN, but she won't do that because she thinks the doctor will say no.\n\nLegally and medically, cannabis use during pregnancy is controversial. Some studies suggest risks, but it's not as clear as alcohol or cigarettes. The wife's point about other medications having risks but being approved by doctors is valid. The husband's refusal might be overstepping if he's not allowing her to seek medical advice. \n\nThe husband's motivation is to protect the child, but he's taking away her autonomy. The wife's autonomy is a key ethical issue here. If she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions, even with the potential risks, the husband shouldn't force her to stop unless there's a legal or medical mandate. However, since he's her partner, he's involved in the decision-making, but the final decision should rest with her.\n\nThe fact that she's asking almost every night and using guilt tactics might indicate she's under stress, and the husband's rigid stance could be adding to her stress. Stress during pregnancy can have its own risks. The husband's compromise was reasonable, but since she refuses to consult the OBGYN, he can't force her. His concern is valid, but his actions might be infringing on her rights. \n\nIn the end, the husband isn't in the wrong in terms of his intentions, but the situation is complex. However, the key point is that the wife has the right to make this decision for herself, and the husband's insistence might be overstepping. So, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy after she stopped using it but now wants to resume for medical reasons, and he's not allowing her to seek professional medical advice.\n"
