However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness.\n\nFirst, the author believes in women's autonomy over their bodies, which is a valid stance. But they changed their mind after researching cannabis use during pregnancy. They found studies suggesting risks to the baby. Their friend, who's knowledgeable about cannabis, also mentioned it's a problem. So the author's decision is based on trying to protect the child.\n\nThe wife agreed initially but later her morning sickness worsened, leading her to beg and guilt-trip the author. She uses the argument that other medications have risks but her doctors say they're minimal. The author tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the OBGYN will say no due to conservatism.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma is balancing parental autonomy vs. the child's welfare. The author is concerned about the child's health, so their intent is protective. But the wife has her own autonomy and her doctors haven't prohibited the medications she's on. The author isn't forcing her to stop; she agreed. However, she's now seeking the author's permission, which complicates things.\n\nIn legal terms, parental rights aren't absolute. Both parents have a duty to protect the child's interests. The author is acting in the child's best interest based on their understanding of the research, even though the wife disagrees. However, the wife is the one making the medical decisions, and the author is stepping in beyond medical advice, which might infringe on her autonomy. But since it's a shared responsibility, the author does have a say.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author overstepped. Since they discussed it and she agreed initially, it's a joint decision. The wife's continued use despite her agreement might indicate she's reconsidering, but the author's stance is based on protecting the child. So, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. The author's position is protective, but the wife's autonomy is also important. The key is that they had a mutual agreement. The author isn't forcing her; they're asking based on new information. Since the wife agreed initially and now is conflicted, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But if the wife is under medical care and the author isn't a doctor, their role is advisory. However, they have a shared responsibility. Given that, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in the child's best interest with the information they have and the wife's initial agreement.\n"
