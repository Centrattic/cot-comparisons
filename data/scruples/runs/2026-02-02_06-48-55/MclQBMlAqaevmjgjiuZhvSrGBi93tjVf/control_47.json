However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. \n\nFirst, the user believes in women's autonomy over their bodies, which makes this a tough call for him. He initially thought it was okay for her to continue using cannabis because he believed it was safe. Then, after talking to a knowledgeable friend and doing his own research, he found that recent studies suggest risks to the baby. So he approached his wife, and she agreed to stop. Now, her morning sickness has worsened, and she's asking him to let her use it again, using arguments like other medications having risks and not wanting to ask her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no.\n\nSo, the core issues here are autonomy versus concern for the child's well-being. The author is trying to balance his wife's right to make her own decisions with his responsibility as a parent to protect the child. He's concerned about the potential risks of cannabis during pregnancy, even though his wife finds it helpful for her symptoms. The wife is struggling with the physical discomfort and may feel that the benefits of using cannabis outweigh the risks, especially since other medications are also risky but prescribed by doctors.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal and medical standpoint, cannabis use during pregnancy is generally discouraged due to potential risks, even if the evidence isn't as clear-cut as with alcohol or tobacco. The author did his research and tried to reach a compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses. The wife's autonomy is important, but so is the unborn child's welfare. However, the wife is the one experiencing the morning sickness and the immediate effects of the pregnancy. She might be in a harder position to make the decision because her health and comfort are directly affected.\n\nThe author is trying to protect the child, which is a valid concern, but by not allowing her to make her own medical decisions, especially when she's already been using it and found it helpful, could be seen as overstepping. The fact that she's using guilt tactics might indicate that the situation is stressful for her, and her refusal to consult her OBGYN might be because she's worried about judgment or lack of support. Maybe the OBGYN could provide a balanced view or alternative solutions. The author's stance is based on his research, but medical advice from her actual healthcare provider is more authoritative.\n\nIn terms of autonomy, even though it's their child, the mother has the primary right to make decisions about her own body unless there's a clear and present danger. However, the line is blurry because the child's health is also at stake. The author's intentions are good, but he might be infringing on her autonomy without sufficient medical backing, especially since his wife's doctors haven't raised the same concerns about the medications she's already using.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be well-meaning, but he's possibly overstepping by not allowing her to discuss it with her OBGYN and by making the decision for her based on his own research. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole), meaning he is in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a consensus. Some might argue that protecting the child justifies his actions, but others would say the mother's autonomy is key here. Since the wife agreed initially but is now struggling, maybe the husband should support her in finding alternatives rather than dictating her choices. So, the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his decision without her full consent after she's changed her mind and is seeking relief.\n"
