However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They initially thought cannabis was safe during pregnancy but did more research after talking to a knowledgeable friend. They found recent studies indicating risks to the baby. They approached the wife, who agreed but later struggled with morning sickness and wanted to use cannabis again. The author is trying to protect the child but respects her autonomy, which creates conflict.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's dealing with morning sickness and finds cannabis helpful. Her doctors have approved other medications with similar or greater risks. The author is taking a stance against cannabis, which the wife feels is being denied unfairly, especially since she can't consult her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no.\n\nThe key points here are bodily autonomy versus the potential risks to the child. The author is prioritizing the child's safety, which is a valid concern. However, the wife has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for the child, but they might also be overstepping by not allowing her to make her own medical decisions, especially since her doctors are prescribing other medications with risks.\n\nThe wife's refusal to consult the OBGYN is a problem. If she's not seeking medical advice, even if she thinks the doctor will say no, that's her choice, but it complicates the situation. The author's compromise was to suggest talking to the doctor, which was ignored.\n\nIn terms of medical evidence, cannabis use during pregnancy is generally advised against due to possible risks, but the research isn't entirely conclusive. If the wife's doctors are okay with other medications, maybe the author is being inconsistent by not trusting her medical team's judgment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are trying to protect the child, which is a valid parental concern. However, they are making a decision that affects her bodily autonomy without full medical consultation. The wife's autonomy is a significant ethical consideration. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting in the child's interest, but they could be neglecting her autonomy and medical advice. It's a tough balance, but since the wife's doctors have approved other treatments, the author's stance might be too rigid. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and medical team's judgment.\n"
