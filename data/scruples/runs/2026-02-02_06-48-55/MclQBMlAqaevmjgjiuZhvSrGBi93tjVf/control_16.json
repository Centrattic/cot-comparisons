However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is pregnant and has been using cannabis for morning sickness. The husband initially was okay with it, thinking it was safe, but after some research and a friend's input, he found potential risks. He talked to his wife, she agreed, but her morning sickness worsened. Now she's asking him to let her use it again, citing other medications she's on with minimal risks. He's torn between her autonomy and the child's safety.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus the child's well-being. The husband believes in women's autonomy over their bodies but is concerned about the baby's health. He did some research and found risks, which led him to ask her to stop. She agreed initially but now wants to resume using it to manage her symptoms. The dilemma is whether the husband overstepped by making the decision for her, especially since she's the one experiencing the pregnancy.\n\nIn terms of ethics, bodily autonomy is a big factor. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body unless there's a clear and immediate danger. However, the husband argues that it's their child, so he has a stake in the decision. But legally and ethically, the primary decision-maker is usually the pregnant person. The husband's role is supportive, not authoritative in medical decisions unless there's a specific legal context.\n\nThe fact that she refuses to consult her OBGYN might be an issue. The husband suggested bringing it up, but she won't. That could mean she's not getting professional medical advice, which complicates things. However, the husband's role isn't to override her medical choices. His concern is valid, but enforcing his view against her wishes might infringe on her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the comparison to alcohol and cigarettes is made, but those are different because they're more regulated and have stronger evidence against their use during pregnancy. Cannabis is a gray area with less consensus. The husband's research might not be as solid, and the reliability of the sources is a factor. If the information he found is conflicting or not from reputable sources, his argument weakens.\n\nIn terms of emotional dynamics, guilt-tripping and constant requests from the wife might be stressing the marriage. The husband feels conflicted between supporting her and protecting the child. But ultimately, the decision should rest with her unless there's a legal or medical order. Since she's the one carrying the pregnancy, her autonomy takes precedence unless there's a clear threat to the fetus that can't be managed otherwise.\n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing concern, but he's overstepping by making the decision for her. He should support her in seeking medical advice and respect her choice once she's made an informed decision. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's infringing on her autonomy without sufficient justification.\n"
