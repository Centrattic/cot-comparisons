However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness. The main points to consider are autonomy, the safety of cannabis during pregnancy, and the couple's dynamic.\n\nFirst, the author believes in women's autonomy over their bodies, which is a strong ethical point. However, he changed his stance after researching and finding potential risks from cannabis. His friend, who's knowledgeable, also influenced him. He presented his concerns to his wife, who initially agreed. Now, the wife is struggling with worse morning sickness and wants to use cannabis again, but she's not consulting her doctor because she thinks the OBGYN will say no due to being conservative.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because he wants to protect their child, comparing it to alcohol or cigarettes, which are more regulated. But he's also aware of her autonomy. The wife is now using medications that doctors approved despite some risks, which adds to the tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's acting out of concern for the baby's health. On the other hand, he's making a decision that affects his wife's autonomy. The key here is whether he has the right to make that decision. In many cases, pregnant women are advised to avoid substances that could harm the fetus, but the final decision often rests with the woman herself, considering her and her doctor's advice. The author's refusal to let her consult her OBGYN complicates things because it's a medical issue that should involve professional input. By not allowing her to make that call, he might be overstepping. Additionally, the wife is using guilt and persistent begging, which isn't healthy for the relationship. The author's compromise was to suggest talking to the OBGYN, but she refused, so maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on him. However, he's still imposing his views without medical consensus. \n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a big factor. If the wife is making an informed decision with her doctor, it's her right. The author might not be in the wrong if there's valid medical concern, but he could be if he's not allowing her to make her own medical decisions with professional guidance. Since he's preventing her from consulting the OBGYN, he's undermining her autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not allowing her to make an informed decision with her healthcare provider, which is the appropriate path. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if the risks are real and he's trying to protect the child. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A because the decision should involve medical advice and her autonomy.\n"
