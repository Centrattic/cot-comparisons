However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness. The author believes in bodily autonomy but changed his mind after more research. He's conflicted because he wants to protect the child but also respects his wife's autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is pregnant and using cannabis for morning sickness. The husband did more research and found potential risks, leading him to ask her to stop. She agrees but then her symptoms worsen, and she's pressuring him to allow it again. The husband feels he's in a tough spot between his values and concern for the baby.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are autonomy versus harm prevention. The wife's right to make decisions about her body versus the potential risk to the fetus. The husband is trying to balance these. He mentions that for alcohol or cigarettes, it wouldn't be a discussion, but cannabis is more complicated. He also acknowledges that she might need a compromise by consulting her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor might not support it.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, especially in medical ethics, there's a principle of autonomy, which supports the wife's right to make her own decisions. However, there's also the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm), which would apply to protecting the fetus. However, since the fetus isn't sentient, the balance can be tricky. The husband is acting out of concern for the baby's health, but his wife is also dealing with her own health and symptoms.\n\nLegally, in most places, the pregnant person has the right to make medical decisions, even if those decisions might risk the fetus. The state's interest in protecting the fetus isn't enough to override the pregnant person's autonomy unless there's a clear and immediate danger, which isn't typically the case with cannabis use in pregnancy. However, medical guidelines often advise against cannabis use during pregnancy due to potential risks, even if the evidence isn't as clear-cut as with alcohol or tobacco.\n\nThe husband's approach of encouraging her to consult her OBGYN shows he's trying to make an informed decision. But she refuses, which complicates things. The husband's stance that he can't forgive himself if something happens to the child adds emotional weight to his position. However, he's also acknowledging her autonomy, which is a significant point.\n\nIn terms of the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person acted in bad faith. The husband here isn't trying to control her in a harmful way; he's genuinely concerned and made a compromise by suggesting she talk to her doctor. Since she refused that step, the responsibility might shift more onto her. However, the husband's persistent pressure despite her agreement could be seen as undermining her autonomy once she's made her decision to continue using it, even if she's struggling with morning sickness.\n\nBut the husband's initial request was reasonable based on his research. The main issue might be his refusal to let her make her own decision once she's agreed to stop, especially if her symptoms have worsened. If she's now using it to manage symptoms, and the husband is preventing her from doing so, that could be seen as overstepping. However, if the medical advice is inconsistent or she hasn't consulted a professional, his hesitation might be justified.\n\nOverall, the husband is in a tough spot. He's trying to protect the child but also respecting his wife's autonomy. However, once she's decided to stop, and her condition has worsened, his continued insistence might be seen as not respecting her decisions, especially if she's seeking relief. But since cannabis use in pregnancy is discouraged, his concern is valid. The answer might hinge on whether the husband is respecting her autonomy now that her health is affected.\n"
