However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable for the husband to ask his pregnant wife not to smoke weed despite her autonomy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and using cannabis for morning sickness. The husband initially thought it was safe but later did more research and found potential risks. He approached her and she agreed initially. Now her morning sickness is worse, and she's pressuring him to let her use it again. She mentions that other medications have risks too, but her doctors say those are minimal. She also won't talk to her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no.\n\nThe husband's stance is about protecting the child, even though he acknowledges her autonomy. The key points here are autonomy versus the child's well-being. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a request she agreed to. However, her autonomy is a big factor here. \n\nIn many cases, pregnant women are advised against using substances like alcohol or certain drugs due to known risks. Cannabis is a gray area; some studies suggest risks, but it's not as strictly regulated. The husband isn't taking away her autonomy entirely\u2014he's encouraging her to consult a doctor, which she refuses. He's trying to balance his concern for the baby with her rights.\n\nBut is he overstepping? Since the wife is an adult and the mother, she has the right to make medical decisions, even if they're risky. The husband's concern is valid, but respecting her autonomy is also important. The fact that she agreed initially but now wants to continue complicates things. He's not forcing her; he's advocating for the child's safety. However, he might be ignoring her current needs and the medical advice she's receiving.\n\nSo, where does the line get drawn? If he had forced her to stop, that's different. But he's making a request and she's now resisting. The fact that she's using it to manage morning sickness, which her doctors haven't opposed, suggests that maybe the husband's position isn't fully aligned with her medical team's advice. Since she refuses to talk to her OBGYN, he can't force her. It's a conflict between two valid concerns: her autonomy and the child's safety. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is infringing on her rights. Since he's not preventing her from using it and she's the one making the medical decisions, he's not in the wrong. He's expressing his concerns, which is reasonable. However, if he's pressuring her to stop despite her needs, that could be an issue. But the scenario says she agreed initially. Now she's changing her mind, and he's standing by his decision. It's a tough spot, but he's not wrong for wanting to protect the child. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
