However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed. The wife is using it for morning sickness, and he changed his mind after some research. \n\nFirst, the husband supports bodily autonomy but is now concerned about the baby's safety. He did some research and found potential risks from cannabis, even though he thought it was safe before. His friend, who knows more about the science, made him rethink. So he approached his wife, and she agreed initially.\n\nNow, she's experiencing worse morning sickness and wants to use cannabis again. She argues that other medications have risks, but doctors say those are minimal. The husband is conflicted between her autonomy and their child's health. He's trying to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she won't because she thinks the doctor will say no.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy vs. safety. The husband isn't forcing her to stop, but he's asking her not to, which she resists. Is that his place? Since it's their child, does he have a say? But at the same time, her autonomy is important. \n\nThe wife's side is that she's using it to manage morning sickness, which is a legitimate medical issue. If her doctors haven't opposed it, maybe there's some validity to her position. But the husband's concern is about the child's safety, which is also valid. However, he's not consulting her doctors, relying on his friend and online sources. Maybe he should have her talk to her OBGYN first instead of making the decision based on his own research. Also, if she's already agreed once and now is struggling, maybe the compromise isn't working. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that if it were alcohol or cigarettes, it wouldn't be a discussion. But cannabis is different legally and medically. The wife's argument about other medications with risks is a counterpoint. The husband's stance might be overstepping if he's not letting her make her own choice after she's informed. But he's also trying to protect the child. \n\nSo, where does the line fall? If the wife is making an informed decision with her doctors, the husband's interference might be wrong. But if the research shows significant risks, maybe he's justified. However, he's not consulting medical professionals, which could be a problem. The fact that she refuses to talk to the OBGYN is a sticking point. Maybe he should encourage her more persistently or seek a second opinion. \n\nIn terms of autonomy, the wife has the right to make decisions about her body, even if the husband disagrees. However, there's a shared responsibility for the child's health. The husband's guilt if something happens is understandable, but that doesn't override her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions might be seen as overstepping. He's using his position to influence her decision without medical justification. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's infringing on her autonomy based on his own research rather than medical advice. But it's a tough call because his intention is to protect their child.\n"
