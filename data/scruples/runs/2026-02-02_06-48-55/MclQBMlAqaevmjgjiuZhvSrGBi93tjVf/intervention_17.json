However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The key points are:\n\n- The author initially supported his wife's autonomy and thought cannabis was safe during pregnancy but changed his mind after research and a friend's advice.\n- He found studies indicating risks, so he asked her to stop. She agreed, but her morning sickness worsened, and she's now asking to use it again, even guilt-tripping him.\n- He's conflicted between his belief in her autonomy and his concern for the baby. He tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the doctor would say no.\n- The user's opinion is that the author is wrong, but they're seeking a different perspective.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the wife's autonomy is important. She has the right to make decisions about her body, especially if she believes cannabis helps her. On the other hand, the author is acting out of concern for the baby's health, based on his research. However, it's her body, and while the husband has a stake in the child's well-being, he isn't the one experiencing the pregnancy.\n\nThe wife's refusal to consult the OBGYN is a point. If the doctor would have given a professional opinion, maybe that could resolve the conflict. But the wife thinks the doctor is conservative, which might not be the case. The husband's insistence without involving medical professionals could be overstepping.\n\nThe husband's actions are well-intentioned, but he's imposing his views on her medical choices. Even if he's right about the risks, the decision should ideally be hers, considering the available medical advice. The fact that she's experiencing worsened morning sickness and is seeking relief might mean that the husband's request is adding stress, which could be detrimental to her and the baby.\n\nSo, while the husband's concern is valid, he's infringing on her autonomy. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the wife's autonomy and her medical needs should take precedence, especially without a medical professional's input. However, the husband's intentions are good. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the ethical stance here would prioritize her rights. So the answer is A.\n"
