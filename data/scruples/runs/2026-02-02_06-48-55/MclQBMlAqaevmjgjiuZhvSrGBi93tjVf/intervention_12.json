However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness. The author mentions valuing autonomy but is conflicted because of new research suggesting risks.\n\nFirst, the wife is pregnant, and the author is concerned about the baby's health. They did some research after talking to a friend and found possible risks from cannabis use. The wife agreed initially but now feels worse and wants to use it again. She's using her autonomy as a point, comparing it to other medications her doctors say are safe.\n\nSo, the question is about balancing autonomy versus safety. The author is trying to protect their child but also acknowledges the wife's right to her body. However, the wife is experiencing morning sickness, which is a legitimate medical issue. The author's compromise was to check with the OBGYN, but the wife refuses because she thinks the doctor would say no. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't forcing the wife to stop; they had a discussion, and she agreed. Now, the wife is struggling with symptoms and wants to use cannabis, which she sees as a necessary treatment. The author is worried about risks, similar to how alcohol and cigarettes are treated. But cannabis legality and perceived safety vary. The wife's doctors have approved other medications with minimal risks, so there's a comparison there. \n\nThe author's stance might be well-intentioned but could be overstepping by not allowing the wife to discuss it with her healthcare provider. The wife's refusal to consult the OBGYN is a problem, but the author tried to suggest that compromise. The author's concern for the child is valid, but so is the wife's autonomy in medical decisions. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they are acting from a place of concern and tried to find a middle ground. However, the wife's autonomy is a strong factor here. The author might be overstepping a bit by not allowing her to consult her doctor, but since she's the one refusing, it's a tricky situation. \n\nGiven the circumstances, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasoned decision based on new information and tried to involve the wife. The fact that she agreed initially but now is struggling is her own challenge. The author's intentions are protective, which is understandable. So, answer B.\n"
