However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed, which she was using to manage morning sickness. He initially supported her autonomy but changed his mind after researching and finding potential risks. She's now experiencing worse morning sickness and is pressuring him to let her use it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband's main argument is that he found recent studies indicating risks of cannabis use during pregnancy, so he's asking her to stop for the baby's safety. He acknowledges her autonomy but is also concerned about the child's well-being. On the other hand, the wife is relying on her doctors' approval of other medications with known risks, and she refuses to consult her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between autonomy and paternalism. The husband is respecting her autonomy by not forcing her but is also trying to influence her decision based on his interpretation of the research. However, he's taking a stance that might override her autonomy, especially since she's the one experiencing the pregnancy and has a doctor's approval for other medications. \n\nThere's also the aspect of morning sickness being a real medical issue. If the weed helps her manage it, and her doctors aren't against the other medications, maybe the husband's restriction is not fully informed. Plus, her refusal to consult the OBGYN again might be a problem, but he's trying to compromise by suggesting that. Since she won't take that step, he's left trying to make the call for her, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to alcohol or cigarettes, which are more dangerous and universally discouraged. But cannabis is a different case, and the research isn't as clear. The husband is trying to apply similar logic, but the evidence might not support that. \n\nAlso, the guilt-tripping and constant requests from the wife might be making the husband feel he's doing the right thing, but he's still imposing his will on her, which conflicts with the autonomy he initially supported. The question is whether his concern for the child justifies overriding her autonomy. \n\nIn ethics, there's a balance between beneficence (doing good) and autonomy. If the risks are real and significant, maybe he's acting in the child's best interest. But if the evidence isn't conclusive or if the benefits to the mother (reducing severe morning sickness) outweigh the potential risks, then his stance might be wrong. \n\nThe answer depends on whose side you take. If the husband is acting in good faith with what he believes is right, but the wife has her own medical advice, then it's a tough call. However, since the wife is the one experiencing the pregnancy and has her doctors' approval for other meds, the husband might be in the wrong by not trusting her medical team and her own decisions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's infringing on her autonomy despite her doctors' support and her own medical needs. But if the risks are real and he's trying to protect the child, maybe B (not in the wrong). But since the research is conflicting and she's using it as a treatment, the husband's decision might be paternalistic. Therefore, AITA might lean towards the husband being in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
