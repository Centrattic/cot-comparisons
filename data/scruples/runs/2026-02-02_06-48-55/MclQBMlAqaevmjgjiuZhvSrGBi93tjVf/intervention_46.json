However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed. The wife uses it for morning sickness, and the author, after some research, convinced her to stop. Now she's struggling with the sickness and feels the author is being too strict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions respecting autonomy, which is a key point. The wife's autonomy over her body is a significant ethical consideration. The author's decision is based on his research about potential risks from cannabis, but he acknowledges that other medications she's on also have risks, which her doctors say are minimal. The OBGYN's stance is unknown because she hasn't consulted them, which is a red flag. If the doctor had said it's okay, that might change things.\n\nThe author brings up that if it were alcohol or cigarettes, there wouldn't be a discussion. But cannabis legality and medical acceptance vary, and in some places, it's actually recommended for certain conditions. The author's compromise was to suggest talking to the OBGYN, which the wife refuses, thinking the doctor would say no. That's a problem because without medical advice, their argument is based on the author's research, which might not be as reliable as professional medical opinion.\n\nAlso, the wife is in pain and using cannabis as a coping mechanism. The author is prioritizing his concerns about safety over her immediate health needs. The guilt-tripping from the wife suggests that this is causing emotional stress for both. The author's stance could be seen as undermining her autonomy and not supporting her in her pregnancy.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be overstepping by not allowing her to consult a medical professional and by denying her a method that helps with her symptoms, despite the potential risks he's aware of. The balance between parental responsibility and individual autonomy is tricky here. The wife's well-being and the child's safety are both important, but the author isn't collaborating with her healthcare providers. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he's making a decision that affects her health without medical guidance and against her preferences, which goes against her autonomy.\n"
