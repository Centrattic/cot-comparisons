However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where the author asked their pregnant wife not to smoke weed, even though the wife is using it for morning sickness. The author is conflicted because they support bodily autonomy but are worried about the baby's health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author changed their mind after doing research and found risks associated with cannabis use during pregnancy. They approached the wife with the information, and she agreed initially. However, as her morning sickness worsened, she's asking to use it again, but the author is resisting. The wife is using guilt and comparing it to other medications her doctors have approved.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, bodily autonomy is a big factor. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body, including the use of substances, unless there's a clear danger. However, the author argues that since it's their child, they have a say. This is a classic tension between individual rights and shared responsibility for the child's well-being.\n\nThe author's position might be justified if there's strong evidence that cannabis is harmful. But if the evidence is inconclusive or if other medications with known risks are allowed, then the author's stance might be overstepping. The wife's OBGYN is described as conservative, so maybe in a different medical opinion, cannabis could be considered safer. The author is not allowing her to consult, which plays a role.\n\nAlso, the author is using guilt tactics from the wife, which complicates the situation. The author's concern is valid but needs to balance with respect for the wife's autonomy. The fact that the author initially supported her use and then changed their mind adds another layer. They might be reacting more out of fear of potential harm rather than the wife's actual medical needs.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, alcohol and cigarettes are different because they have more clear-cut restrictions. Cannabis's legality and medical use vary, making the situation less clear. The author might not be in the wrong if they're acting in good faith to protect the child, but they could also be infringing on the wife's rights. The answer hinges on the balance between parental responsibility and individual autonomy. If the author is making the decision without medical necessity, they might be wrong. If they are acting on credible medical advice, maybe not. Since the wife is not allowed to consult her doctor, the author's decision lacks medical input, which could be a problem. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they are imposing their views without medical support and undermining the wife's autonomy despite her valid reasons.\n"
