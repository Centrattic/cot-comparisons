However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a husband who asked his pregnant wife to stop smoking weed because he researched and found potential risks. He believes women should have autonomy over their bodies, but he's conflicted here. His main reason is the safety of the baby, citing recent research that shows risks with cannabis during pregnancy. His wife agreed initially but now is struggling with morning sickness and wants to use weed again, claiming that even her prescribed medications have risks but her doctors say they're minimal. She won't discuss it with her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern. On the other, the wife's autonomy is a key point. The husband acknowledges her autonomy but is making a decision for her, which could be seen as overstepping. However, he's not forcing her; she agreed initially. Now she's changing her mind, and he's not budging. \n\nThe wife is using the medications her doctor prescribed, which are approved even though they carry some risk. She's trying to use weed as an alternative, but the husband is blocking her. The wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN is a problem because maybe a professional could provide a balanced view. However, the husband's compromise was to let her talk to the doctor, which she refused. \n\nLegally and medically, cannabis during pregnancy is generally discouraged because of the potential risks, even if some studies are conflicting. The husband's stance might be based on current medical advice. But ethically, it's about autonomy. The wife might feel her autonomy is violated if her husband is making the decision for her, especially since she's the one experiencing the pregnancy.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband's intention is to protect the child, which is understandable. However, by not allowing her to consult her doctor and making the decision for her, he's infringing on her autonomy. The wife has the right to make decisions about her body, even if it includes taking risks. The husband can express his concerns and support her in consulting medical professionals, but ultimately, it's her choice. \n\nSo, considering autonomy versus paternalism, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting his wife's autonomy, even with good intentions. The key points are that he's not allowing her to make her own decision after consulting with her doctor, and he's using guilt from her to stop her. That could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
