However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed. The author is conflicted because they believe in bodily autonomy but feel it's for the child's safety. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife is using cannabis for morning sickness. The author researched and found potential risks, so they asked her to stop. She agreed initially but now her symptoms are worse, and she's pushing to use it again. She mentions other medications with risks but doctors say they're minimal. The author wants to protect the child, comparing it to alcohol or cigarettes, but acknowledges the autonomy issue.\n\nThe key points here are bodily autonomy vs. the child's welfare. The author is trying to balance both. But does the author have the right to impose their will on the wife's body? The wife's autonomy is a big factor. Even if the author's intentions are good, the decision to use cannabis during pregnancy is ultimately up to the pregnant person, especially since medical guidelines might vary. The author's friend's input and their own research don't override the wife's right to make medical decisions, especially if her doctors are approving other medications. The fact that the wife is consulting with her OBGYN and the author isn't suggests that the medical professionals are the ones who should guide this. The author might be overstepping by not allowing her to discuss it with her doctor, especially since she feels the OBGYN is conservative. The author's compromise was to suggest talking to the OBGYN, but she refused, so maybe the author should respect her choice here. \n\nAlso, the author is comparing it to alcohol or cigarettes, which are more clearly harmful, but cannabis's risks are less clear. The author's conflict between their values and the perceived risk is valid, but pushing against her autonomy might be wrong. The wife is the one experiencing the pregnancy, so she has the right to decide what's best for her and the baby, considering medical advice. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy despite their concerns.\n"
