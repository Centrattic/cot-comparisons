However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. The author believes in women's bodily autonomy but changed their stance after doing more research, finding potential risks to the baby. The wife agreed initially but now her morning sickness is worse, and she's pressuring him to let her use it again. She argues that other medications have risks but her doctor says they're minimal. She refuses to consult her OBGYN because she thinks they'll say no.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they did research, found risks, and wanted to protect the child. But the wife's autonomy is a big factor here. The wife is the one making medical decisions for her body, even though the author is concerned about the child. However, the author's role as a partner is to support, not control. The wife's doctor hasn't advised against cannabis, but she's not seeking their opinion. The author tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're respecting her autonomy initially but are now imposing their own research. The wife is the one who should make decisions in consultation with her healthcare providers. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing concern, but they might be overstepping if they're making the decision for her. The wife's autonomy is a key point here. Even if the author believes there's a risk, the final decision lies with her, especially if the medical community isn't against it. The author's guilt and concern are valid, but the boundary is crossed if they're dictating her medical choices. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering with her autonomy despite her agreement to stop initially and then pressuring her not to seek medical advice.\n"
