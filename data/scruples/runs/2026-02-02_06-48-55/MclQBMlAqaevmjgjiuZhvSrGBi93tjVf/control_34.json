However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for asking his pregnant wife not to smoke weed. He initially supported her autonomy but changed his mind after more research.\n\nFirst, the key issue is the balance between parental autonomy and the health of the unborn child. The husband's stance is that using cannabis during pregnancy might be risky based on his research. His wife, on the other hand, is using it for morning sickness and feels it's necessary. She's also pointing out that other medications have risks but are accepted by her doctors.\n\nThe husband tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses because she thinks the doctor will say no. This is a conflict between their values: he's prioritizing the child's safety, and she's asserting her right to manage her own body. \n\nIn terms of autonomy, the wife has the right to make decisions about her body, even if others disagree. However, the husband's concern is about the well-being of the fetus. Legally, in many places, the mother's rights take precedence, but ethically, there's a debate. \n\nThe husband isn't forcing her; he's asking. She's the one using the substance. While he's trying to protect the child, he's also respecting her autonomy by not forcing the issue. However, the fact that she's persistently pressuring him and he's feeling guilt-tripped complicates things. \n\nThe question is whether his request crosses the line into infringing on her autonomy. Since he's not restricting her from using it but is making a choice based on his research, it's more of a personal concern than a violation of her rights. However, the pressure he's exerting through his requests might be seen as undermining her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the mention of alcohol and cigarettes is relevant because those are universally discouraged during pregnancy, but cannabis's status varies by region and medical opinion. His stance might be inconsistent if cannabis is legal in their area, but his research might override that. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but the situation is complex. The wife's autonomy is a strong factor here. Since he's not forcing her and she's the one making the final decision, he's not entirely at fault. But the fact that he's pressuring her to stop despite her needs might tip the balance. However, given that he's trying to protect the child and isn't using coercion, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
