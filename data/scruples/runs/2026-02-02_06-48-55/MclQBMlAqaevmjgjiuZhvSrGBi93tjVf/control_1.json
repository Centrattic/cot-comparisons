However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with morning sickness. They believe in women's autonomy but are concerned about the baby's safety. \n\nFirst, the husband did some research after talking to a friend and found that cannabis use during pregnancy might have risks. He shared this with his wife, who agreed at first. But now her morning sickness is worse, and she's begging him to let her use it again. She argues that her doctors' medications also have risks, but her doctors approve them. The husband is stuck between her autonomy and his concern for the baby.\n\nSo, the key points are autonomy vs. safety. The wife has the right to make decisions about her own body, but the husband is worried about the child's health. The question is whether he overstepped by making the decision for her.\n\nThe husband's intention is to protect the baby, which is understandable. However, by not allowing her to consult her OBGYN, he's not respecting her autonomy. The wife's doctors are the ones who should assess the risks and benefits. Also, if she's experiencing severe morning sickness, her health and comfort are important. The husband might not have the medical expertise to override her doctors. \n\nBut then again, he's considering the baby's well-being, which is also a valid concern. However, the correct approach might be to support her in discussing it with her doctor rather than unilaterally deciding. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's acting in good faith to protect the child. On the other, he's limiting her autonomy without a medical professional's input. \n\nI think the main issue is that he's not letting her make the decision in consultation with her doctor. By not allowing her to bring it up because she thinks the OBGYN will say no, he's not giving her the chance. That could mean he's taking away her agency. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's making a medical decision for her without proper medical guidance. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because his intentions are good. Hmm. \n\nLooking again, the wife is trying to get him to compromise, and he's not letting her consult her doctor. That seems like a problem. Autonomy is important, especially in medical decisions. So even though he's concerned, he should support her in talking to her doctor. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not allowing her to make that decision with her healthcare provider. So answer A.\n"
