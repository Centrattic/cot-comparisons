However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who asked his pregnant wife not to smoke weed, even though he initially supported her autonomy. He changed his mind after researching and found potential risks. Now his wife is struggling with morning sickness and wants to use weed, but he won't let her, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are about autonomy versus the husband's concern for the child's safety. The husband believes in autonomy but made an exception here. He did his research, found studies suggesting risks, and the wife agreed at first. Now she's facing worse morning sickness and is trying to convince him again. \n\nThe wife is using the argument that other medications have risks but her doctors accept them. She's also refusing to consult her OBGYN because she thinks the doctor is conservative. The husband feels he has a right to be involved since it's their child, even though it's her body.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in most places, the pregnant woman has the right to make decisions about her body, even if it involves some risk. The husband can advise but can't make the decision for her. Ethically, autonomy is a big factor. The wife's autonomy vs. the husband's concern for the baby. \n\nThe husband's research might be valid, but medical advice from her actual doctor would be more authoritative. The wife isn't following up with her OBGYN, which is a red flag. The husband's compromise was to suggest talking to the doctor, which she refused. That's a problem because the husband isn't the medical expert. He's making a decision based on his own research, which might not be as reliable as the wife's doctor's opinion.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He's respecting her autonomy initially but then imposing his own research findings. Even though his intentions are good, he might be overstepping by not letting her consult her doctor. His argument about alcohol/cigarettes not being discussed is a comparison; those are more clearly harmful, but weed's risks are less established. So, he's using a stricter standard for weed than for other substances.\n\nAlso, the wife's mental health and her ability to cope with morning sickness is a factor. If she's using weed to manage symptoms, and the husband is preventing that without medical guidance, it could be harmful. The husband's guilt about potential harm is valid, but he's denying her autonomy for his fears, not her doctor's orders.\n\nIn ethics, autonomy is a key principle. Unless there's a clear, immediate harm (which alcohol and smoking have), the decision should be hers. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, might infringe on her rights. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy after she's already made a choice, and he's not allowing her to consult her doctor. His compromise was for her to talk to the doctor, which she refused, so he shouldn't override her decision without that input.\n"
