However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their pregnant wife to stop smoking weed during pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband initially didn't mind his wife continuing to use cannabis, thinking it was safe based on studies. Then he did more research and found that there are risks, so he asked her to stop. She agreed but later started feeling guilty and the morning sickness worsened, so she wants to use it again. The husband is conflicted because he respects her autonomy but also wants to protect the child.\n\nNow, the legal and ethical aspects. Cannabis use during pregnancy is a gray area. Some places have decriminalized it, but medical advice often warns against it. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a suggestion based on research. He tried to compromise by suggesting she talk to her OBGYN, which she refuses. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. paternalism. The husband supports her autonomy but is making a request for the child's sake. There's no coercion; she agreed initially. The wife is choosing to use guilt to get her way. \n\nLegally, in many places, the decision about substance use during pregnancy is up to the pregnant person. The husband has no legal authority here. Ethically, it's a matter of balancing two concerns: the mother's right to make her own choices and the potential risk to the child. The husband is acting out of concern for the baby, which is understandable, but the final decision should be hers, especially if the medical risks are not absolute. \n\nThe husband's approach seems reasonable. He did his research and communicated his concerns. The wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN complicates things, but the husband isn't forcing her. So, is he in the wrong? If he's not pressuring her and she's making a choice, then maybe not. However, if the husband is using his position in the relationship to override her autonomy, that's a problem. But from the description, he's trying to find a middle ground. \n\nAlso, comparing to alcohol and cigarettes is relevant because those are more clearly harmful. Cannabis's risks are less clear, but the husband's request is based on the information he has. The fact that she's using other medications with minimal risks adds complexity. The doctors approve those, so the discrepancy in advice might play a role. \n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intent is protective, the ultimate decision lies with the wife. Since he isn't forcing her and is acting on his own concerns, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
