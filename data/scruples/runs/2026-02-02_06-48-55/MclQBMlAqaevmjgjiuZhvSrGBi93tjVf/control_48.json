However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who asked his pregnant wife not to smoke weed to help with her morning sickness. He believes in women's autonomy but changed his mind after doing some research, finding that cannabis might pose risks to the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife uses cannabis for morning sickness, and the husband is concerned about the baby's health. He did some research, found potential risks, and discussed it with her. She agreed initially but now her symptoms have worsened, leading her to ask him to let her use it again. She's using medications with minimal risk as a counterargument, and the husband is caught between his initial stance on autonomy and his responsibility as a father.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's acting out of concern for the child's safety. He approached the situation by doing research and communicating with her. The wife has autonomy over her body, but there's a shared responsibility since it's their child. However, the wife is the one experiencing the pregnancy and the morning sickness, which is a medical issue. Her doctors might have approved the medications she's on, which are considered low risk, but she's not consulting her OBGYN about cannabis, possibly because she thinks the doctor will say no.\n\nThe husband's position is that he wants to avoid potential harm, similar to how alcohol or cigarettes are strictly avoided during pregnancy. But he acknowledges the autonomy issue. The key here is balancing the wife's autonomy with the child's well-being. In many ethical discussions, when there's a conflict between two parties' interests (the mother and the fetus), the mother's autonomy is often prioritized, but there's also the father's concern. However, legally and ethically, the woman has the right to make decisions about her body, even if her partner disagrees. \n\nBut in this case, the wife is already using medications that her doctors have approved, which have minimal risk. The husband is pushing for abstinence from cannabis, which has some risks. The wife is in a tough spot because her symptoms are worse now without the cannabis. The husband is trying to protect the baby but might be overstepping by not allowing her to consult her doctor, as she's hesitant due to the doctor's conservatism.\n\nSo, the husband's intentions are good, but he's imposing his decision on her, even though she has the right to make her own medical choices. The fact that she's considering the medications' risks versus cannabis might indicate that she's weighing her options. The husband's refusal to let her ask her OBGYN could be an issue because it's the doctor's responsibility to evaluate all factors and make a recommendation. By not allowing that, he's taking personal responsibility instead of seeking professional medical advice.\n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and the medical decision-making process. Even though he's concerned about the child's safety, the final decision should rest with the woman, especially since her doctors are the ones who can assess the risks accurately. The husband's stance could be seen as undermining her agency in her pregnancy decisions.\n"
