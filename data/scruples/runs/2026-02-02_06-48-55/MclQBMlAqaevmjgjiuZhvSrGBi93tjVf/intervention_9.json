However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don't know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife not to smoke weed during pregnancy. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he believes in women's autonomy over their bodies. But he's conflicted because he's concerned about the baby's health. He initially thought it was safe but changed his mind after researching and talking to a knowledgeable friend. Then he approached his wife, who agreed to stop, but now her morning sickness is getting worse, and she's asking him to let her use it again. She argues that other medications she's on have some risks, but her doctors say they're minimal. The author tried to suggest she talk to her OBGYN, but she refuses, thinking the doctor would say no because they're conservative.\n\nSo, the main points are: the husband's concern for the baby's health versus the wife's autonomy and her need to manage morning sickness. The husband feels he's acting in the child's best interest, but it's causing tension because of the wife's autonomy.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In most places, the pregnant person has autonomy over their body, even if it affects the fetus. The fetus isn't a separate legal person, so the mother's rights take precedence. The husband isn't the legal guardian of the fetus, so he can't impose restrictions. However, he's also a parent, so his concern is valid, but he can't override her decisions.\n\nThe wife's refusal to consult her OBGYN is concerning. If she's using other medications that have been approved by her doctors, maybe she's already balancing risks. The husband's argument about alcohol or cigarettes isn't directly applicable because those are illegal during pregnancy, but weed's legality varies. However, the key issue is that the husband is trying to influence her health decisions, which is her right.\n\nThe husband's compromise was to suggest talking to the OBGYN, but she wouldn't take it. That might indicate she's not seeking professional advice, which could be a problem. But the husband's role here is to support her decisions, not dictate them. Even if he's worried, he can't force her to stop using it. His guilt over potential harm is understandable but doesn't give him the authority to make that decision.\n\nSo, from an autonomy standpoint, the author is in the wrong because he's infringing on his wife's right to make decisions about her body. Even if his intentions are good, he can't override her autonomy. The wife's worsening morning sickness and her attempts to get approval from him or the doctor show that she's trying to manage her symptoms, which is her right. The husband should focus on supporting her through alternative methods if she chooses to use weed, rather than trying to control her decisions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
