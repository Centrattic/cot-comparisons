      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a parent whose toddler knocked over someone's drink at the airport. The girl who spilled accuses the parent, and the parent refuses to replace it because the girl was rude.\n\nFirst, the parent's responsibility. A 3-year-old is a minor, and parents are generally responsible for their children's actions. So if the kid did spill the drink, the parent might be liable. But the girl didn't ask, just accused and demanded payment. The parent is upset about the rudeness and the lack of a proper request, so they walked away. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, the parent might argue that the girl's approach was confrontational and they felt disrespected. On the other hand, the parent's child caused the spill, and they could be expected to handle it politely, even if the other person was rude. \n\nBut the key points here are: 1) Did the parent's child actually cause the spill? The parent asked the son, and he admitted to bumping it. So there's an acknowledgment of the action. 2) The girl's approach was rude, but the parent could have still taken responsibility and then addressed the rudeness separately. \n\nSo, even if the girl was abrupt, the parent might still be expected to replace the drink. Walking away and refusing could be seen as not taking responsibility, hence in the wrong. The parent's partner also called them an asshole, which adds a social perspective. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. If the parent believed the girl was lying or if there was a misunderstanding, that could be different. But in this case, the child admitted to bumping it, so the parent knows it's their responsibility. Choosing not to replace it out of spite for the rudeness might be the wrong choice. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people usually expect parents to cover accidental damages, even if the other party is rude. The parent's decision to walk away might be seen as AITA (Am I the A**hole), hence the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
