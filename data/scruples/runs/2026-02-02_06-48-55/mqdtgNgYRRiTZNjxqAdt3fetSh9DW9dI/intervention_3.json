My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23andMe test when the parents didn't want them to do it. The parents had a situation where the mother was assaulted, and they chose to raise the child as the father's daughter. The author wants to take the test to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm paternity. The parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The parents made a decision seven years ago not to do a test, and now the author is going against that. The parents were probably protecting the child and themselves from potential emotional turmoil. The mother's reaction being so strong that she won't speak to the author suggests this is a sensitive topic. The author's intention is to find out the truth, which is understandable, but they also acknowledge that their dad is the one who raised them, regardless of biological ties.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to know their biological origins, especially if there's a significant event like an assault involved. But on the other hand, the parents made a choice to move forward without that information, possibly to maintain family stability and protect the child. The author's actions might be seen as disregarding their parents' wishes and the decision made for their well-being. The parents might feel that their authority or the family dynamic is being undermined by this test.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are upset, but the author is an adult now (since it's been seven years since age 13). At 20, they might have more autonomy. However, the parents' feelings and the family's chosen dynamic are important. The author's decision could cause further conflict and emotional distress. The parents might have valid reasons for not wanting to disrupt the existing family structure. \n\nBut also, the author's desire to know their truth is a personal right. It's a balance between respecting parental decisions and self-determination. The key points are the parents' initial decision, the reasons behind it, and the potential consequences of the author's actions. If the parents are still emotionally vulnerable about the issue, the author might be causing pain. However, the author isn't forcing a confrontation, just seeking information. The response might depend on cultural or familial values, but ethically, the parents made a choice that the child's well-being was prioritized over biological truth. The author's insistence could be seen as selfish or disrespectful, but maybe not entirely wrong.\n\nI'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong. Because as an adult, they have autonomy and the right to seek their own medical information. But maybe A, if the parents' wishes are being disregarded. The parents didn't test before, but the author is now doing it without their consent. The parents might feel betrayed. However, the author's reasons are valid. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on whether the author is an adult and the parents' ability to enforce their decision now. In many cases, adults can make their own decisions about genetic testing, even if it's against their parents' wishes. The parents' disapproval might be hurtful but not necessarily make the author wrong. So maybe B.\n"
