My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' approval. Let me break this down.\n\nThe key points here are: the person found out at 13 that their parents were unsure about their paternity due to a past assault. The parents never tested it and chose to raise the person as the father's daughter. Now, the person wants to do a DNA test to see their genetic makeup and possibly confirm the relationship with their cousin. The parents are upset, especially the mother, who is upset about the decision and the father is sad.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is right or wrong. \n\nFirst, consider the parents' perspective. They made a decision seven years ago to avoid the test, perhaps to protect the family's dynamics or due to the trauma of the assault. The mother's reaction is significant here. The father also asks if the author sees him as their father, and the author affirmed that. This shows the author respects their father's role even if there's uncertainty.\n\nFrom the author's side, they're seeking closure and truth about their biological origins. The trauma of not knowing might be a valid reason. However, they went ahead with the test despite the parents' objections. The parents feel disrespected, which is a key point. The mother's refusal to speak and the father's sadness indicate family conflict caused by the author's decision.\n\nEthically, this is a gray area. The right to know one's origins versus respecting parental decisions. In some legal systems, minors might not have the autonomy to make such decisions, but the author is 20 (since they were 13 seven years ago), so an adult. However, the parents' feelings and the family's established dynamics are important. The author might have a valid reason, but acting against the parents' wishes could be seen as disrespectful, especially given the parents' initial decision to avoid the test for a reason.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the balance between personal truth-seeking and respecting family decisions. The parents' trauma and the potential disruption to family relationships are significant. The author's actions might be seen as causing harm despite their intentions. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded their parents' wishes, even if their motivations are understandable.\n"
