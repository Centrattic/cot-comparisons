      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a past incident where the mother was sexually assaulted, leading to uncertainty about the author's paternity. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as their daughter. Now, the author wants to take a DNA test, possibly to confirm their relationship with their cousin and get their genetic info. The parents are upset, especially the mother, who is cutting off communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author's desire for truth and self-knowledge is significant. They were told about the possible paternity issue at 13, which has been a source of distress. The parents' decision to not test was made seven years ago, but the author is an adult now. In many places, adults have the right to make their own medical and genetic decisions without parental consent. However, the parents still feel it's their decision because they were the ones who originally decided against testing.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' reasons might be rooted in protecting the author's emotional well-being and maintaining family harmony. They chose to raise the author as their child regardless of biology, which shows a commitment to their decision. The author's action could potentially disrupt that, especially if the test results reveal something unexpected, leading to family conflict or emotional harm.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is an adult. Their right to know their genetic origins is a recognized ethical concern in medical and psychological fields. The American Psychological Association, for example, recognizes the right to identity and genetic information as part of personal autonomy. The parents might have the right to make certain decisions when the child is underage, but once the child is an adult, that right diminishes.\n\nAlso, the author has already communicated their intent and received negative reactions. However, the author's statement that they still see their father as their father shows respect for the parents' role, even if the test might show a biological difference. This suggests the author isn't trying to undermine their parents' role but seeks personal clarity.\n\nThe key factors are the author's age (adult), the right to personal genetic information, and the parents' past decision versus the author's current autonomy. While the parents' feelings are valid and important, the author's right to self-determination could outweigh the parents' objections in this context. The test might provide closure and help the author's mental health, even if it causes short-term family tension.\n\nHowever, the parents' distress is real. The mother's refusal to speak to the author could lead to lasting family damage. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Ethically, if the author is an adult, they are not in the wrong for seeking their own genetic information. The parents' decision seven years ago was under different circumstances (the child being a minor), and now the adult has the right to make their own choices, even if it conflicts with parental wishes.\n"
