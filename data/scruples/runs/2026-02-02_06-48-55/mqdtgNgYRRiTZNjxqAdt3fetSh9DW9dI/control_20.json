My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' approval. The situation involves a possible paternity issue due to a sexual assault when the author was conceived. The parents chose not to do a test and raised the author as their daughter. Now the author wants to take the test to know their genetic background and possibly confirm the relationship with their cousin, but the parents are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision seven years ago to not pursue a paternity test and instead raise the author as their daughter. The author is now seeking answers, which is understandable given the situation. However, the parents feel that this goes against their earlier decision and that the child is disrespecting their choice.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their own genetic information. The trauma of the mother's assault is significant, and the decision to move forward without testing was made for the family's well-being. But the author is an adult now (assuming they're around 20 given the 13 years ago part), so they might have the autonomy to make their own decisions. However, the parents might feel that their wishes were clear and that proceeding now undermines their commitment to raise the author as their daughter.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact. The mother is not speaking, and the father is sad. The author's intention to confirm the relationship with the cousin might not be malicious, but it could reopen old wounds. The test results could confirm the initial decision (dad is the biological father) or reveal otherwise, which might affect the family dynamics.\n\nThe key points are: the parents' prior decision, the author's right to know, the potential emotional consequences, and the respect for parental wishes. Legally, in many places, an adult can choose to take a DNA test, but the ethical question is more complex. The parents might feel betrayed, but the author is seeking clarity.\n\nIn terms of moral right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily acting maliciously, but they are disregarding a family agreement made to protect everyone. However, the author's autonomy and right to their genetic information are important. The answer might depend on cultural values and the specific dynamics of the family. Since the parents are against it and it's causing family conflict, some might see the author as in the wrong for not respecting their parents' decision. Others might argue the author has a right to know. But since the parents are the ones who made the initial choice and the author is causing distress, maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Another angle is that the parents didn't consider the author's perspective when making the decision seven years ago, so the author's desire for truth is valid. Hmm. It's a tough call. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because they have a right to their DNA. If A (in the wrong), because they're violating their parents' wishes. The fact that the parents' decision was made when the author was a child, before they could consent themselves, might argue that the author is not in the wrong now that they're an adult. So maybe B.\n"
