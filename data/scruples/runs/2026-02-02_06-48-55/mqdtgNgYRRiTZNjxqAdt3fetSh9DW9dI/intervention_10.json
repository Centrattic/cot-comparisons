My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a possible paternity issue due to the mother being sexually assaulted. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as the father's daughter. Now the author wants to take the test to see their genetic makeup and check relation with the cousin. The parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The parents made a decision seven years ago to not pursue the paternity test and to raise the author as their daughter. The author is now acting on their personal desire for genetic information, which might conflict with the parents' wishes. But the author also has a right to their own genetic information, especially given the traumatic history their mother experienced.\n\nThe mother's assault is a significant factor. The decision not to test might have been for the family's emotional well-being. The author's action could potentially reopen old wounds or disrupt the family's agreed-upon narrative. However, the author's feelings of being bothered by the uncertainty are valid too. They might feel a right to know their biological origins.\n\nLegally, in many places, once a person reaches adulthood, they can make decisions about genetic testing on their own. So the author might not be legally wrong. Ethically, it's more complex. The parents might feel disrespected, thinking the author is disregarding their past decision. The author's intention isn't necessarily malicious; they want clarity for themselves. The father's reaction shows he's concerned about his role, while the mother's silence indicates deep emotional distress.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author's decision is personal and about self-knowledge, but it's made without considering the immediate family's feelings. Whether it's right or wrong depends on values\u2014prioritizing individual rights versus family harmony. The parents might see it as a breach of trust, but the author's quest for truth is also understandable. It's a tough call. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to their genetic information, but the parents' feelings are valid. However, the author could have communicated better or waited, considering the family's sensitivity. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is seeking their own information and the parents' decision was from seven years ago. But it's a nuanced situation.\n"
