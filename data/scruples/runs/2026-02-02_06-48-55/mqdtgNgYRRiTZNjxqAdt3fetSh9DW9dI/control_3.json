My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is considering taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves unresolved paternity due to a past sexual assault. The parents chose not to test and have raised the person as their daughter. The author feels conflicted about the truth but wants to know their genetic makeup and confirm the relationship with their cousin.\n\nFirst, the parent's stance: They made a decision to keep the paternity uncertain, possibly to protect the family's stability. The mother is upset, and the father is sad. The author argues that they want to know the truth and that they still see their father as their father regardless of biology.\n\nMoral considerations: The parents' decision was based on their values and circumstances at the time. The author's desire for personal knowledge is valid, but it's causing family tension. The key issue is whether the author is overstepping by pursuing a test against the parents' wishes, especially when it could disrupt family dynamics.\n\nLegal aspects: There's no mention of legal issues, so it's more about family ethics. The parents' consent isn't the legal requirement here, but their emotional investment is significant. The author's action might be seen as a breach of their parents' decision, even if the author respects their father.\n\nEmpathy and communication: The author has communicated their intent, and the parents reacted negatively. The father's question about being seen as a father shows the emotional stakes. The mother's silence indicates severe upset.\n\nBalancing the author's need for truth against the parents' right to their decision. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking truth, but they should consider the impact on family relationships. The parents' feelings are valid, so the author's choice might be ethically questionable despite their good intentions. The answer might hinge on the balance between personal rights and family harmony. However, the author's right to their genetic information is a personal matter, so the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but the conflict complicates it. However, since the parents made a conscious decision to keep it private, the author might be overstepping by ignoring their wishes, even if they respect their father. So maybe A.\n"
