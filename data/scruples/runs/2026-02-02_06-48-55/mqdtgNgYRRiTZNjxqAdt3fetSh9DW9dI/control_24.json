My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' approval. The situation involves the author's parents not wanting the test because there was a history of possible non-paternity due to the mother's sexual assault. The parents decided to raise the author as the father's daughter without testing.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation is to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relation to their cousin. The parents reacted negatively, especially the mother, who is upset about the author going against their decision. The father, while sad, acknowledges he's seen as the father regardless.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, the parents made a decision when the author was young to avoid the test, perhaps to protect the author's well-being. The author now wants to take control of their own identity and health information. On the other hand, the parents might feel betrayed because they made a choice they thought was in the author's best interest.\n\nIn many cases, as people grow into adulthood, they have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and genetic information. The author is now an adult (since it's been seven years since age 13), so autonomy is a factor. However, the emotional impact on the parents, especially the mother cutting off communication, is significant. The father's sadness also shows the potential for family disruption.\n\nLegally, the author might have the right to get the test done as an adult, but morally, there's a conflict. The parents' wishes might be seen as a family decision, but the author's right to their own genetic information could override that. However, the author's actions could be seen as disregarding the parents' long-standing decision, which might be considered disrespectful.\n\nIt's a tough call. If the author's intent is purely to understand their health and heritage, and they've made clear that they still see the father as their dad, maybe the parents' reaction is more about their own unresolved issues. But the author might be in the right to seek this information for personal knowledge, even if it causes tension. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the author's autonomy as an adult is a strong point in their favor.\n"
