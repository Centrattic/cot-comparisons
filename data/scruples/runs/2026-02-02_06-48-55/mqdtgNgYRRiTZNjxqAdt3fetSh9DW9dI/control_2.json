My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The key point is the mother was sexually assaulted, leading to uncertainty about the author's paternity. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as the father's daughter. The author wants to know their genetic makeup and check the relationship with their cousin, but parents are upset.\n\nFirst, the author's right to know their own biology. They've been bothered by the uncertainty for years. The parents' decision was to protect the family dynamic, but the author is an adult now. The parents might see the test as violating their original agreement. However, the author's desire for knowledge isn't inherently wrong. The parents' reaction is emotional, but the author isn't breaking any laws or causing direct harm. The father acknowledged he's the parent regardless. So, it's a conflict between the author's autonomy and the parents' wishes. Legally, the author can make their own decisions. Ethically, it's more nuanced, but the author's intent is to seek truth without malice. The answer is B, not wrong.\n"
