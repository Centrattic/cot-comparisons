My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test against their parents' wishes. The situation involves possible paternity due to their mother being assaulted. The parents chose not to test, but the person wants to know their genetic makeup and check if they're related to their cousin who already did the test.\n\nHmm, the parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad. The user said they do see their dad as their father regardless. So the main points here are the parents' decision versus the child's desire for information. The assault adds a layer of trauma for the parents. \n\nLegally, maybe the child can get the test done. But ethically? The parents made a choice to protect the child's well-being by not testing. The child's right to know their origin versus the parents' right to privacy and their past trauma. It's a tough balance. \n\nThe user's parents might feel that the decision is final, and the child is overstepping. But the child's desire for truth is valid. However, the parents' reaction suggests deep emotional issues. The author might not be wrong, but they could be causing harm. It depends on intent and how they handle it. If they proceed without respecting their parents' feelings, maybe they're in the wrong. But if they're seeking truth and have already clarified their feelings towards their dad, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer might be B, not wrong. Because the child has a right to their genetic information, even if it upsets the parents. But some might argue A because they're disregarding the parents' decision. It's a gray area. But given the context of the parent's trauma and the child's reassurance to their dad, maybe the right to know outweighs it. So leaning towards B.\n"
