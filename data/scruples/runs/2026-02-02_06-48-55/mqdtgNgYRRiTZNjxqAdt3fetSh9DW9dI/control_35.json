My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to take a 23andMe DNA test despite their parents' objections, specifically because there's uncertainty about their paternity due to the mother being sexually assaulted. The parents raised the person as their daughter, but now the author wants to confirm their genetic relationships, especially with a cousin who already did the test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision seven years ago to not pursue a paternity test, agreeing to raise the author as their daughter. The mother's assault is a traumatic event, and the parents' choice to move forward without testing was to protect the family dynamic. Now, the author is conflicted between their own desire for truth and respecting their parents' wishes.\n\nThe key points are the parents' autonomy versus the child's right to know. Legally, in some places, adults have the right to access their genetic information, but in others, there might be restrictions. However, this is more about ethics. The parents argue that it's their decision, but the author is now an adult (since they were 13 seven years ago, they're 20 now). As an adult, the author might have more autonomy in making decisions about their own body and genetic information.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset, especially the mother who refuses to speak to them. The father is sad but asked a direct question about seeing him as a father. The author affirmed that, which is important. The parents' emotional response is significant here. The author's intention is to find out the truth, but the method (using 23andMe) might be seen as bypassing their parents' wishes, even if the parents don't have legal authority to stop them anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to know their biological heritage. On the other hand, the parents' decision to protect the family's emotional well-being is also valid. The author's action could potentially reopen old wounds and disrupt the family's established dynamic. However, since the author is an adult, the argument for personal autonomy might outweigh the parents' objections.\n\nBut then, the parents' consent was part of the original agreement. The mother was assaulted, which is a very sensitive issue. The author's desire to know might conflict with the parents' trauma. The ethical dilemma here is between the child's right to know and the parents' right to protect their family from potential harm.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, respecting others' autonomy and well-being is crucial. The author's parents might have chosen to avoid this situation for their own mental health and the child's upbringing. By going through with the test, the author might be disregarding their parents' emotional needs. However, the author's own need for truth and identity is also a valid concern.\n\nIt's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. But since the author is an adult, their autonomy is a strong factor. However, the potential harm to the parents' well-being is significant. The answer might depend on the balance between these two aspects. If the author proceeds, they might be within their rights but ethically in a gray area. If they respect the parents' wishes, they might be prioritizing family harmony but sacrificing their own quest for truth.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their genetic information as an adult, and the parents' decision from seven years ago might not hold in terms of current autonomy. However, there's a strong argument that they should consider their parents' feelings. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the law might support the author's right, the ethical judgment might lean towards B.\n"
