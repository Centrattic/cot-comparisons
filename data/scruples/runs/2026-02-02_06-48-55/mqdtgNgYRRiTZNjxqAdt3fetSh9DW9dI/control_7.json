My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' opposition. The situation involves possible paternity uncertainty due to the mother being assaulted. The parents chose not to test and raised the child as their daughter. The author wants to know if they're wrong for going ahead with the test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They made a decision seven years ago to not pursue testing and to raise the child as their daughter. They might feel that this matter is closed, and the child's actions could reopen old wounds or betray their trust. The mother's reaction being so strong that she won't speak to the author suggests deep emotional impact.\n\nFrom the author's side, they've been troubled by the uncertainty for years. Their desire to know their genetic makeup and confirm their relationship with the cousin is understandable. The author also reassured their father that they consider him their father regardless of biological ties. This shows the author isn't trying to undermine the family structure but seeks personal clarity.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, adults can make their own medical decisions, including genetic testing. If the author is an adult, they might have the right to pursue this. However, if they're a minor, then the parents' authority would be stronger. Since the author was 13 seven years ago, they are likely an adult now, which shifts the balance towards their autonomy.\n\nEthically, it's a conflict between the child's right to know their genetic origins and the parents' decision to protect the child from potentially painful information. The parents' decision back then was to shield the child, but the child now feels a need for answers. The father's sadness indicates he's hurt by the child's actions, even if he acknowledges the child's feelings.\n\nThe cousin already did the test, which might have triggered the author's desire to do the same. The parents might feel the author is disregarding their wishes, but if the parents had a different stance now, they could have addressed it differently. The author's reassurance about the father's role is important\u2014it shows they're not challenging his parental status just to find out the truth.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're asserting their right to personal information. On the other, they're going against their parents' wishes, which can strain family relationships. But considering the author's age and the potential for personal resolution, it might not be entirely their fault. The parents' stance could also be seen as limiting the child's autonomy, especially if the child is an adult now.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is seeking personal knowledge, which is a valid pursuit, and if they're an adult, they have the right to make such decisions. However, the emotional impact on the family is significant, but the responsibility isn't entirely on the author.\n"
