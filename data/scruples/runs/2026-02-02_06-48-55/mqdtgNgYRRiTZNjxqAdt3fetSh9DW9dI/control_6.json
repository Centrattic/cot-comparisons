My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should take a 23andMe test when their parents, especially their mom, don't want them to. The parents had previously not tested for paternity, even though there was uncertainty due to a sexual assault. The person wants to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm if they're related to their cousin, but their parents are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They decided not to do the test for whatever reasons, maybe to protect the family, avoid conflict, or protect their daughter from potential emotional distress. The mother, in particular, is upset and even stopped speaking, which shows this is a big deal for them. The dad, while sad, still wants to be seen as the father regardless of biology.\n\nOn the other hand, the person is an adult now (they were 13 then, so now around 20). They have a right to their own genetic information. The trauma of the assault and the uncertainty about their heritage could be causing them personal distress. The parents kept this information from them as a child, which might have contributed to their desire to know the truth now.\n\nThe key points are consent and the person's autonomy. Since they're an adult, they might have the right to make this decision for themselves, even if it goes against the parents' wishes. However, the parents' feelings and the potential for family conflict are also important. The parents might feel betrayed or disrespected if the child goes ahead without their approval.\n\nIn some cases, genetic testing can reveal sensitive information that affects not just the individual but the whole family. The mother's refusal to speak to them suggests that this could lead to lasting family rifts. But the person is also dealing with their own emotional needs and the right to know their origins.\n\nI need to balance the autonomy of the adult child with the parents' right to privacy and their previous decision. Since the parents didn't do the test themselves and the child is now making their own choice, it's a complex situation. Legally, as an adult, the person can choose to do the test. However, morally, it's about respecting the family's wishes versus personal truth-seeking.\n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. But considering the person's age and their right to know their own genetic information, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they approached it might have caused unnecessary hurt. Maybe they should have had a more sensitive discussion or sought counseling before proceeding. But the act of taking the test itself isn't necessarily wrong. So probably answer B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
