My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The key points are the parents' reasons for not wanting the test and the adult child's motivations.\n\nThe parents mentioned uncertainty about paternity due to an assault, and they chose not to test to raise the child as their daughter. The mother is now upset, and the father is sad. The person wants to know their genetic makeup and check if they're related to their cousin. They've already told their parents, who reacted negatively.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, the parents' decision was based on protecting the family from potential truth that could cause harm. The child's desire to know their biological roots is understandable, but it's important to respect the parents' wishes if agreed upon previously. However, since the child is now an adult, their right to personal information might be considered. The parents might feel betrayed, but the child isn't wrong for seeking their truth once they're adults. So, it's a balance between respecting parental decisions and personal autonomy. The answer leans towards not being in the wrong because the individual has a right to their genetic information as an adult.\n"
