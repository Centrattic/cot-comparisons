I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a person wanting to do a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The parent's reason is that there was uncertainty about the author's paternity because the mother was sexually assaulted. The parents chose to raise the author as the father's daughter without testing.\n\nThe author is 13 years old now, seven years later. They want to take the test to find out their genetic makeup and see if they're related to their cousin. The parents, especially the mom, are upset and say it's their decision. The dad is sad but the author affirmed he's their father regardless.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A or B. Let me think about different angles.\n\nFirst, parental rights versus the child's right to know. The parents made a decision not to test, but the child is now an adult (assuming they're 20 now, if they were 13 seven years ago). Wait, 13 seven years ago would make them 20 now. So they're an adult. So maybe they have more autonomy here. But in some places, depending on the law, maybe the parents still have some control? Not sure.\n\nBut even if they're an adult, the parents might still be emotional about it. The mother was assaulted, and the father is part of the family. The parents chose to raise the child as the father's daughter. The author's desire to find out the truth could conflict with the parents' decision to maintain that family structure.\n\nBut then again, the author says they're not trying to disrespect the parents' decision. They clarified that they still consider the dad their father. So maybe the author isn't trying to undermine the parents' decision but just seeking personal information.\n\nHowever, the parents might see the test as reopening old wounds. The mother being assaulted and the parents not testing suggests they wanted to avoid that situation. The author's action could be seen as going against their wishes, even if respectfully done.\n\nBut the author is an adult. In many cases, adults can make their own decisions about genetic testing. However, it's a sensitive issue because it involves family secrets and potential for harm. If the test results confirm the parent isn't the biological father, that could affect the family dynamics even if the author says they consider him their father.\n\nBut the author's right to know their own biological information is a key point here. There's a debate about whether someone has a right to know their biological parents, even if it goes against family wishes. On the other hand, respecting the parents' decision to keep that information private is also important.\n\nIn this case, the parents have been clear about not wanting the test done. The author is going against their wishes. Even if the intention is not to disrespect, the parents might feel betrayed. The author's cousin did the test, which might have prompted the author to do the same to compare relations. But the parents might not want that comparison or the potential discovery.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have a valid desire for information, but it's conflicting with their parents' wishes. Depending on cultural, ethical, and legal contexts, the answer might vary. However, since the author is an adult, they might have the right to make this choice. But the emotional impact on the parents can't be ignored.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, the balance between autonomy and family harmony is considered. The author's autonomy might be seen as more important here, especially since they've already taken the step of the test despite the parents' objections. However, the parents' reasons for not wanting the test (to protect the family structure and avoid trauma) are significant.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents' wishes are to be respected, then the author is in the wrong by going against their decision. But if the author's right to know overrides that, then they're not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the answer leans towards B (they're not in the wrong) because they're an adult seeking their own genetic information, and they affirmed their commitment to their father regardless of the results. However, the parents' feelings and the context of the assault add complexity. But ultimately, the author might not be in the wrong if they're making a personal choice as an adult.\n"
