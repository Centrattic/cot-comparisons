My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The parents, especially the mother, are upset because they had previously decided not to do a paternity test. The father's sister's son already did the test, and the author wants to do the same, partly to see if they're related and to get their genetic info. The parents feel disrespected because they made a choice to not test, and the mother won't speak to the author now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The parents wanted to keep things private and move forward with the father raising the child as his own. The author, on the other hand, has a right to know their biological origins, especially since it's been bothering them for years. The mother was raped, which adds a layer of trauma and complexity. The parents might be protecting each other and the child from that trauma by not addressing it. \n\nBut the author is an adult now, and the situation is seven years after the initial conversation. The parents' argument is that they made the decision not to test, so the author shouldn't go against it. However, the author argues that their own desire for information is valid. The father's reaction, though sad, seems more about the emotional impact rather than outright disapproval, while the mother's reaction is more severe.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might have a right to their genetic information. But they also have to respect their parents' wishes, especially considering the sensitive nature of the situation. However, the parents didn't test when the child was younger, and now the child is an adult seeking answers. There's a balance between respecting parental decisions and an adult child's autonomy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for proceeding. Some might say yes because they're going against their parents' explicit wishes, which could cause lasting family damage. Others might say no because the author has a right to their own genetic information and the parents' decision was made without considering the child's future feelings. \n\nThe key factors are: the parents' initial agreement to raise the child regardless of biology, the trauma involved, the child's right to know, and the current family dynamics. The author's action could be seen as self-centered if it disregards the parents' decision, but it's also a personal right to seek information about one's heritage. \n\nI think the answer is more nuanced. However, in many cases, respecting parental boundaries is important, especially in sensitive matters. But since the author is an adult and the parents didn't test when the child was younger, the author might not be entirely wrong. But the parents' feelings are valid too. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit split.\n"
