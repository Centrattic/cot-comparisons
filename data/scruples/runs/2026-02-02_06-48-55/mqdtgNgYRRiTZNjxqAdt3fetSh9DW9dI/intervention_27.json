My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to take a 23andMe DNA test despite their parents' objections, especially since there's a history of possible paternity issues due to the mother being assaulted. The parents don't want a test done, and the author wants to confirm their genetic relationship with their cousin and possibly their own paternity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parents made a decision years ago to not pursue a paternity test and have raised the author as their child. The mother was assaulted, which is a traumatic experience, and the parents chose to move forward without testing. Now, the author is an adult (assuming they're 13 +7 years old now, so maybe 20 or so?), and they're seeking this information for themselves.\n\nThe key points here are the respect for the parents' wishes versus the author's right to know their biological heritage. On one hand, the parents have their reasons, possibly to protect the family dynamic and avoid further trauma. On the other hand, the author is seeking closure and understanding of their own identity. \n\nBut the parents are upset, and the mother is cutting off communication. The author's father is sad, which shows the emotional impact of this situation. The author says they still consider their father as their father regardless of biological ties, which is a positive sentiment. However, the parents' stance is that the decision was theirs and the author shouldn't disrespect that.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of the author's right to know against the parents' decision. Legally, once someone is an adult, they can make their own decisions about DNA testing. Ethically, it's more complex. The parents might feel that the author is reopening a painful chapter, especially since the assault was part of the reason for the initial uncertainty. The author's desire for truth is valid, but it's also important to consider the family's emotional state.\n\nIn some cases, DNA testing can provide closure, but it can also cause rifts. The parents might have chosen to avoid the test to maintain family harmony, and the author's action could be seen as disregarding that choice. However, the author isn't a child anymore, so they might have the autonomy to seek this information, even if it's against the parents' wishes.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being disrespectful by going against the family's previous agreement. The parents have expressed their decision clearly, and the author's action could be seen as violating that boundary, even if the author's intentions are good. The fact that the mother is now not speaking to them suggests a significant breach in their relationship.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for wanting the test, the parents' objections and the current emotional fallout might mean that the author is in the wrong for proceeding without respecting their parents' wishes. However, there's also an argument that the author is within their rights as an adult. But given the context of the parents' trauma and their explicit decision, the author's action could be seen as disrespectful, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
