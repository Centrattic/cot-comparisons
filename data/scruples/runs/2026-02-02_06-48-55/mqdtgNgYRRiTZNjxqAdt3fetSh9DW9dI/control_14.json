I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related.

My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent, especially since their parents don't want them to. The background is that the author's parents mentioned uncertainty about paternity due to the mother being sexually assaulted when the author was conceived. They agreed not to test and raise the author as their daughter. Now the author wants to take a DNA test, partly to see their genetic makeup and also to check if they're related to their cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents made a decision seven years ago not to do a paternity test, and now the author is considering going against that decision. The mother is upset, and the father is sad. The author says they would still consider their dad their father even if he isn't biologically. \n\nSo the question is about whether the author is wrong. The possible answers are A (yes, they are wrong) or B (no, they are not wrong). Let me break down the ethical and emotional aspects. The parents chose to move forward without testing, perhaps to protect the author from the truth or to maintain family stability. However, the author has been bothered by this uncertainty for years. The cousin already did the test, so maybe the author is curious about their relation. \n\nIn terms of rights, as an adult, the author might have the right to know their biological origins, especially if the parents were honest about the uncertainty. But the parents might feel that their decision was final and that the child's well-being is better served by not pursuing it. The mother's refusal to speak to the author suggests a strong emotional reaction, which could lead to family conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's statement to the dad shows that they value their relationship, which is good. But the parents might still be protective. Legally, in many places, once a child reaches adulthood, they can consent to such tests, but ethically, it's more complicated. The parents might feel disrespected if the author goes against their wishes, even if they're not the biological parents. \n\nThe cousin doing the test might be a factor. If the cousin is okay with sharing their data, maybe the author is trying to find answers there. However, the main issue is with the parents. The parents' reasons for not testing could include protecting the author from potential stigma, preserving the family dynamic, or their own emotional struggles. The author's desire for knowledge is valid, but the parents' autonomy in making that decision also matters. \n\nIt's a balance between the child's right to know and the parents' right to make decisions. If the author is now an adult, they might have a stronger claim to their own genetic information. But the parents' feelings and the potential impact on the family should be considered. The author should probably talk it through with the parents, maybe seek counseling, to understand each other's perspectives before making a decision. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents made a decision in the best interest of the child, but the child is an adult and wants to know the truth, the answer might lean towards B (not wrong). However, the parents' feelings are hurt, so it's a conflict between the child's right to know and respecting their parents' wishes. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their motivation is to know their own genetic information, and as an adult, they have autonomy. But they might be going against their parents' wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the parents' decision was made to protect the author, but the author is now seeking answers. The answer could be B (No), but there's a nuance here. The parents might be wrong in not allowing the test, or the author is right in seeking it. The answer might be B.\n"
