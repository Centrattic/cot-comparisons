      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test when their parents don't want them to. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author found out at 13 that their parents had some uncertainty about their paternity due to the mother being sexually assaulted around the time of conception. The parents chose not to do a test and raised the author as their daughter. Now, the author wants to do a 23andMe test, partly to understand their genetic makeup and to see if they're related to their cousin who did the test. The parents are upset because they think it's respecting their original decision not to test. The mother is cutting the author off, and the father is sad.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' wishes versus the author's desire for information. The parents made a decision seven years ago not to test, which they might have done for emotional or protective reasons. The author is conflicted but reassures their dad that regardless of the results, he's still their father. However, the parents are upset because the author is going against their decision.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents have a right to privacy and the decision they made back then. They might have chosen not to test to protect the family dynamics or to avoid potential harm. The author's action could breach that understanding. On the other hand, the author is 20 years old now (assuming they were 13 seven years ago), so they might be an adult, and thus their autonomy could be a factor. They have a right to their own genetic information, which might affect their health or identity.\n\nBut the question isn't about legal rights but about moral wrong. The parents' feelings are hurt because they see the author's action as disrespecting their decision. The author might feel they're seeking closure or truth. The parents might feel betrayed because they made a choice for the family's well-being, and the author is now undermining that.\n\nIn many ethical situations, respecting family decisions and the potential for causing harm is important. If the author's parents were clear seven years ago that they don't want any testing, going against that could be seen as not respecting their wishes. However, the author is also dealing with personal identity and possibly health implications, which are significant.\n\nBut the parents are still emotionally invested in this. The mother is completely cutting off contact, which is extreme, and the father is sad. The author might be causing intentional harm by disregarding their parents' decision. Even though the author reassures their father, the act of getting the test could still be seen as violating the parents' original agreement.\n\nIn some cases, people do these tests without consent, leading to family issues. However, the author did tell their parents, which is different from doing it secretly. The parents reacted negatively, but the author's action might be seen as a breach of trust. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their parents' prior decision, even if their intentions are personal.\n"
