My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to do a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a possible paternity issue from when the author was 13. The parents mentioned uncertainty in paternity due to the mother being sexually assaulted. They chose not to test and raised the author as their daughter. Now, the author wants to take a DNA test, which their parents are upset about, with the mother cutting off contact and the father being sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision to not pursue testing, possibly to protect the family dynamics and the author's well-being. However, the author feels it's important for their own identity and understanding of their genetic makeup. The key points here are the parents' wishes versus the author's right to know their own biological heritage.\n\nLegally, in many places, adults can make their own medical decisions, including genetic testing, even if their parents disagree. However, the emotional and familial impact is another layer. The parents might feel betrayed or that the author is undermining their decision. The author's justification is about not lying about the discomfort and wanting to know their genetic relation to their cousin.\n\nI should think about the intent here. The author isn't trying to disrupt the family on purpose but seeks personal truth. The parents' reaction suggests they wanted to maintain a certain narrative for the author's sake. But does the author have the right to seek their own information once they're an adult? \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel they're not wrong because they're seeking truth about their own origins. The parents might see it as violating a family agreement. There's also the aspect of consent; the parents didn't test, but the author is now of age to make their own choice. \n\nThe answer hinges on balancing the author's right to information against the parents' wishes. If the author is an adult, they have autonomy over their body and medical decisions. The parents' disapproval, while hurtful, doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, the situation is sensitive, and the author might need to consider the potential consequences on family relationships. But legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for making this choice as an adult. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
