My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves the parents not wanting to confirm the paternity because of a past assault, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They chose not to do the test seven years ago and have been raising the author as their daughter. They might feel that the author is disrespecting their decision by pursuing the test now. The mother's reaction is anger, and the father is sad, which suggests deep emotional stakes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with personal feelings of uncertainty about their origins. They mention that they were told about the possible paternity issue at 13, which has been a source of distress. Taking the test could resolve that uncertainty, even if it means facing potential family conflict.\n\nI should also think about the autonomy of the author. As an adult, they might have the right to seek information about their genetic heritage. However, the parents' decision to protect the author from that information might be based on their own trauma and a desire to maintain family harmony.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to know vs. the parents' right to make decisions they think are in the child's best interest. Laws and societal norms often side with the individual's right to know their genetic information once they're adults. But emotionally, it's complicated. The parents might feel betrayed, especially the mother who is in a feud with the author now.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear yes or no. But if I have to choose, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they are seeking their own truth and autonomy. However, they might need to handle it sensitively. But according to the question, the answer is either A or B. Considering that the parents explicitly told them not to do it, there's an argument for the author being in the wrong for disregarding their parents' wishes. But again, the author's right to know their heritage could override that, especially if they're an adult now. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
