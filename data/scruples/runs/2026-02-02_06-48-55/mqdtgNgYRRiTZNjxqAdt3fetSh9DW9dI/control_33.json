      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' approval. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is 13 years old (now around 20?), and their parents mentioned possible paternity issues due to the mother being assaulted around the time of conception. The parents chose not to do a test and decided to raise the person as the father's daughter. Now, the person wants to take a DNA test, partly to see their genetic makeup and to check if they're related to their cousin who did the test. The parents are upset, with the mom being angry and the dad sad. The question is whether the person is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethical angles. The parents made a decision years ago to not pursue testing, possibly to protect everyone's feelings. The person, however, is now an adult (assuming they're 20+), so they might have the right to make their own decisions about their genetic information. But on the other hand, the parents might feel that they made a commitment to raise the person as their daughter, and the test could disrupt that. The mother's reaction could be about protecting the family's emotional well-being or her own trauma from the assault.\n\nThe person did tell their parents before proceeding, which shows they considered their feelings, but the parents still reacted negatively. The dad's question about seeing him as a father and the person's affirmation is important\u2014it shows the person's intent isn't to reject the father but to understand their own biology.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a sensitive situation. The person's desire for knowledge is valid, but the parents' feelings and past decision need respect. However, since the person is an adult, they might have the autonomy to pursue this. The key point is whether the parents have the authority to prevent an adult child from seeking their own genetic information. Since DNA testing is a personal choice once you're an adult, the person might not be in the wrong. But it's a gray area because it affects family dynamics. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they're asserting their right to know, even if it upsets their parents.\n"
