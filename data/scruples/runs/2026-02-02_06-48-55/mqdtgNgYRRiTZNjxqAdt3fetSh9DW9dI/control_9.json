My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test when their parents don't want them to. The situation involves possible paternity issues from the mother's assault. The parents chose not to test and to raise the person as their daughter. Now the person wants to do the test to find out if they share a biological relation with their cousin, who already did the test. The parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They agreed not to test back when the situation happened, maybe to protect the child and maintain family stability. The mother's trauma from the assault might make this issue very sensitive for her. The father is also upset, even though the child affirmed his role as a parent. The parents might feel that the child is disregarding their decision and potentially reopening old wounds.\n\nOn the other hand, the child has valid reasons. They've been wondering about their biological background for years, and the cousin's test might have sparked curiosity. The desire for self-knowledge is a common human need. The child also clarified that they still see their father as their dad, which shows they aren't rejecting him. However, the parents' feelings of being disrespected are significant here.\n\nNow, whether the child is in the wrong depends on the context. Legally, there's no law against doing a DNA test, but there's the emotional aspect. The parents' wishes were made clear, and the child is going against that, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the child is also seeking answers about their own identity, which is important. The key here is the balance between the child's right to know and respecting the parents' decision.\n\nIn similar situations, it's often considered important to respect family boundaries, especially when sensitive issues are involved. The parents chose not to test to avoid conflict and protect the child. The child's actions might cause emotional harm, even if their intentions are good. While the child isn't legally wrong, ethically, there's a case for considering the parents' feelings and the potential consequences.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they're disregarding their parents' explicit decision and causing emotional distress, even if their motivations are understandable. But there's also a strong argument for B (not in the wrong) because the child's desire for self-knowledge is valid. However, the parents' perspective and the potential harm caused suggest that the child might be in the wrong here.\n"
