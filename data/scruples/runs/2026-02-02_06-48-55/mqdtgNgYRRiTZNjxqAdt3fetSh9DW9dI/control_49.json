My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a past assault on the mother, which led to uncertainty about the author's paternity. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's motivations. They mention that the paternity uncertainty has bothered them for years, and they want to find out their genetic makeup and whether they're related to their cousin who took the test. The parents are upset, especially the mother, who is against the testing. The father is sad but acknowledges he's seen as the father regardless.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author is an adult now (since they were 13 seven years ago), so they have autonomy over their own body and decisions, including genetic testing. The parents' decision not to test in the past doesn't necessarily override the adult child's current desire to seek information. However, there's also the emotional aspect. The parents might be protecting their privacy or the mother's trauma from the assault. The author's action could potentially reopen wounds or confirm something that the family has chosen to leave unspoken.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between the author's right to know their origins and the family's wishes. If the parents have consistently kept this information private, the author's pursuit of the test might be seen as disregarding their family's boundaries. On the other hand, the author has a valid emotional need to seek closure and understanding about their identity.\n\nLegally, the author can choose to take the test since they're an adult. But morally, it's more nuanced. The parents might feel betrayed if the test reveals a different biological father, which could strain family relationships. The author's reassurance to the father that he's still seen as the father is important, but the mother's silence suggests deeper pain.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether respecting autonomy is more important than respecting family wishes. In some views, the adult child has the right to seek their truth, while others might argue that respecting the family's decision is crucial for maintaining harmony. Since the parents are now opposed and the mother is upset, the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate, even if legally permissible. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) if the focus is on family respect, or B (not in the wrong) if autonomy is prioritized.\n"
