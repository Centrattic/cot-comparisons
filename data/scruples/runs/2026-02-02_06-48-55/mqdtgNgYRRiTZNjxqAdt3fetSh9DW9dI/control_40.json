My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for taking a 23andMe test without their parents' consent. The situation involves a possible paternity issue from the mother's sexual assault during the parent's conception. The parents decided not to test and raised the child as their daughter. The person wants to take the test now to confirm their genetic relation to their cousin and possibly their own parentage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parents made a decision seven years ago to not do a test, prioritizing the child's well-being and family stability. The child is now seeking answers, which is a natural human desire. The parents, especially the mother, are upset, and the father is sad. The question is whether the child's right to know their genetic origins outweighs the parents' wishes.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting parental decisions and the individual's autonomy. The parents might have felt that the test would cause more harm than good, perhaps fearing family disruption or emotional distress. On the other hand, the child has a right to their identity and biological information. In some legal contexts, minors have limited rights, but this person is likely an adult now (since they were 13 seven years ago, they're around 20). Adults have more autonomy, but family dynamics can complicate this.\n\nThe parents' reaction is strong, with the mother refusing to speak to them. This suggests that the parents feel betrayed. The child's statement that they still consider their father as their father is a positive step, but the parents might still feel the test is a violation of their earlier agreement.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The child's desire for information isn't inherently wrong, but the parents' decision to avoid testing was made with the intention of protecting the child. However, the child's autonomy and right to know their origins could be seen as valid. Societal views on this vary, but many argue that an adult has the right to seek genetic information, even if it goes against past family decisions.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation. The parents' feelings are valid, but the child's decision to seek truth isn't necessarily wrong either. The key is the intent and the potential consequences. If the child is prepared for the possible fallout and the test results don't necessarily disrupt the existing family structure (since they already accept their father), then it's a personal right. However, if the test could cause significant harm without clear benefits, the parents' stance might be more justified. But in this case, the child has already acknowledged their father's role, so maybe the risk is lower. Therefore, Answer B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
