I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent. The situation is that the parents had previously mentioned uncertainty about paternity due to the mother being assaulted. They chose not to test and raised the child as the father's daughter. Now the author wants to get a DNA test to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm the relationship with their cousin. The parents are upset, with the mother not speaking and the father being sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision not to test, possibly to avoid conflict or to protect the family dynamic. The child, now older, feels the right to know their biological origins. There's a conflict between the parents' wishes and the child's desire for information.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, autonomy is important. The child is an adult now (assuming they're 13 +7 = 20, which is an adult in most places), so they might have the right to make decisions about their own body and information. However, the parents might feel that their prior decision should be respected, especially as it was made in the child's best interest at the time.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact. The mother's trauma from the assault is a significant factor. The test could potentially cause her more distress if the results reveal the truth. The father's emotional response shows he feels hurt, even if he accepts the child as his own.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's right to know their biological heritage is a valid point. Many people believe that knowing one's origins is a fundamental right. The parents' refusal might be seen as withholding information that's crucial to the child's identity.\n\nI should also consider legal aspects. In some places, minors might not be allowed to get such tests without consent, but if the author is an adult, they likely can. Legally, the parents might not have the authority to prevent an adult child from obtaining their own genetic information.\n\nHowever, the ethical question is not just about legality. It's about the impact on family relationships. Even if the author isn't legally wrong, they might be ethically wrong by disregarding their parents' wishes, which were made with the intention to protect. The parents might feel betrayed, which could lead to lasting family rifts.\n\nThe author's intention to confirm the relationship with their cousin also adds another layer. If the cousin did the test, maybe the author feels it's important for their own genetic knowledge and possibly their health, which could be a valid reason. But the parents' distress is real and needs to be considered.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's autonomy and right to know versus the parents' wishes and their emotional well-being. It's a tough call. Some might say the author is in the right because they have a right to their own genetic information. Others might say they're in the wrong for not respecting their parents' prior decision, especially given the traumatic context.\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents explicitly stated not to do the test, and the author goes against that, it could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the author is an adult, their autonomy might outweigh the parents' wishes. The answer might depend on cultural values and the specific circumstances of the family.\n"
