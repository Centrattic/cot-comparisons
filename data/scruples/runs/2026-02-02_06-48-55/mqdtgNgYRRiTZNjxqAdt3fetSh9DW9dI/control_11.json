My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' approval. The situation involves paternity uncertainty due to a sexual assault, and the parents decided not to test, choosing to raise the child as their own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person is 13 years old when the issue comes up, but now they're seven years older, so maybe around 20 now. They have a right to know their biological origins, especially given the traumatic history involving their mother. The parents' decision not to test might have been made to protect the family, but the individual's right to their own genetic information is a valid point.\n\nThe parents are upset because they see it as disrespecting their decision. But the person is also struggling with the uncertainty. Legally, in many places, once you're an adult, you can make your own medical decisions, including genetic testing. However, the emotional impact on the family is significant here. The mother is not speaking to them, and the father is sad, which shows the testing has hurt them.\n\nOn one hand, the person's right to know their heritage and health information is important. On the other hand, they might be causing pain to their parents by going against their wishes. There's a balance between autonomy and family harmony. The parents made a choice for the family's well-being, but the individual's need for truth is also a factor.\n\nI think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the person is seeking information about their own origins, which is their right. But I need to check if there are any nuances I'm missing. The parents' feelings are valid, but the individual's autonomy might take precedence here. The fact that the person reassures their dad that they see him as their father shows they're not trying to reject him, just seeking truth. So maybe B is the right choice.\n"
