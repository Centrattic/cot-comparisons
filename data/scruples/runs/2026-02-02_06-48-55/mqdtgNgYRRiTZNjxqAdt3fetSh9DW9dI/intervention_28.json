I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about a person who wants to take a 23andMe DNA test despite their parents' objections. The parents mentioned uncertainty about the person's paternity because the mother was assaulted when the person was conceived. They decided not to test and raised the person as their daughter. Now, the person wants to do the test to check their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relation to their cousin. The parents are upset, especially the mother, who is not speaking to them now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They made a decision not to test and raised the person as their child, possibly to protect them from the trauma of the assault and the uncertainty. The mother's assault is a serious issue, and the parents might have wanted to avoid reopening old wounds. The mother is now upset, which suggests that the issue is sensitive for her. The father is sad but acknowledges the person as his daughter even if he's not the biological father.\n\nOn the other hand, the person wants to know their truth. They mention that not knowing has bothered them for years. The cousin already did the test, so the person might feel it's their right to know their genetic information. The 23andMe test could help them connect with their cousin genetically and understand their heritage. But they did tell their parents, and the parents reacted negatively. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for proceeding despite the parents' wishes.\n\nLegally, once you're an adult, you have the right to make your own medical and genetic decisions. However, ethically, there's a consideration of respecting the parents' wishes and the potential emotional impact on the family. The parents might feel that their decision to not test was respected, and the person's actions now are disregarding that. The mother's silence and the father's sadness indicate the emotional toll this could have on the family.\n\nBut the person is also seeking answers to their own identity and family history. The assault on the mother is part of the reason for the uncertainty, and the person has a valid desire for clarity. However, the way the situation is handled could affect the family dynamics. The person might be in a difficult position between their own need for information and respecting their parents' decision.\n\nI think the key points are: the person's right to know their genetic information versus the parents' right to make decisions regarding their family's privacy. Since the person is an adult, their right to seek their own genetic information might outweigh the parents' objections. But the parents' feelings and the potential damage to the family relationships are significant. The answer might depend on whether the person's action is seen as a legitimate pursuit of truth or a disregard for the family's established boundaries.\n\nIn some cultures, family decisions are prioritized, but in others, individual autonomy is emphasized. The person might not be in the wrong if they are acting in good faith to seek their own truth, but they should consider the emotional impact and perhaps seek a way to handle it sensitively, maybe through counseling or mediation. However, since the question is about whether they are in the wrong, it's a tough call. I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the person has valid reasons, but others might see it as A (in the wrong) for disregarding the parents' wishes. But I need to make sure I'm considering all angles.\n"
