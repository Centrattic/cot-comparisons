I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is 13 years old, but now older, and their parents mentioned paternity uncertainty due to their mother being assaulted. The parents chose not to do a DNA test and raised the author as their daughter. Now the author wants to do a 23andMe test to find out their genetic makeup and possibly confirm if they are related to their cousin. The parents, especially the mother, are upset, and the dad is sad.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding with the test despite the parents' wishes. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they've been told about the uncertainty since they were 13, which has bothered them. They want answers and to know their genetic background. The cousin did the test, so the author wants to compare. Also, the author clarified they still see their dad as their father, regardless of biology. This shows they might not be trying to reject their father but just seeking personal information.\n\nFrom the parents' side: they chose not to do the test for their own reasons. Maybe they wanted to protect the author from the truth, maintain family unity, or because the situation was traumatic. The mother's reaction is extreme, cutting off communication, which might indicate deeper issues. The dad is sad but asked if the author still sees him as a father, suggesting he's trying to maintain the relationship.\n\nLegally, in most places, minors can't do DNA tests without consent, but the author is an adult now. So they have the right to their own genetic information. However, the parents might feel their decision should be respected, even if the child is an adult. There's a balance between the child's right to know and the parents' right to make decisions they deemed best for the family.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author has a right to their biological information, especially if it's crucial to their identity. However, the parents might have considered the emotional impact on everyone involved. The author's action could potentially disrupt family dynamics, especially if the results reveal something that the parents were trying to keep from causing harm.\n\nThe parents' objection seems to be about respecting their decision, but the author is an adult now. The parents might have thought they were protecting the author at 13, but the author is now making their own choice. The father's sadness suggests he's conflicted, maybe worried about the results affecting the family.\n\nIn many cases, an adult's right to know their genetic heritage is considered important. However, the parents' emotional response is valid too. The key factors are the author's intent (not to reject the father, but to know the truth) and the parents' original decision being based on their circumstances at the time.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents made a decision when the author was a child, but the author is now an adult seeking information that the parents withheld, it's a matter of autonomy vs. parental authority. Since the author is an adult, their decision might be respected. However, proceeding without considering the parents' wishes could hurt them. But the author's right to know their origins is also a significant factor. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. But in many ethical frameworks, the person's right to self-knowledge is prioritized, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way they presented it might have been abrupt, but that's a different issue.\n"
