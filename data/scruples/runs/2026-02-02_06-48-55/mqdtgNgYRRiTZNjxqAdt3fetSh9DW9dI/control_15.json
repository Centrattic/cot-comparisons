I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23andMe test when the parents don't want them to do it. The person was told by their parents at 13 that there's uncertainty about their paternity because the mother was raped. The parents chose not to do a test and raised the person as their daughter. Now, the person wants to take the test, but the parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents made a decision long ago not to pursue paternity testing, which they've been honoring for seven years. The person is now acting on their own desire to find out the truth, which they've been dealing with for years. The parents are upset because they feel the decision was made by them, and the person is going against that. The person says they still consider their father their father regardless of biology. \n\nSo, from the parents' perspective, they've handled a traumatic situation by choosing not to test, perhaps to protect the family or for emotional reasons. The child's decision to test now might reopen old wounds or challenge the family's established narrative. On the other hand, the person has a right to know their genetic heritage and might be struggling with identity issues. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus family decisions. In many cases, adults have the right to make their own medical and genetic decisions, especially regarding their own bodies. However, this is a sensitive family matter where the parents have made a choice based on past trauma. The person is in a difficult position between their own need for information and respecting their parents' wishes.\n\nI should also consider cultural or familial values. Maybe the parents wanted to avoid potential conflict or legal issues that might arise from a paternity test. The fact that the person is now considering the test might be seen as a breach of trust or an undermining of the parents' decision. However, the person is also dealing with their own emotional need to know the truth.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The parents might not have given consent for the test, but as an adult, the person may have the right to consent to their own genetic testing. The age mentioned in the original question is a bit ambiguous\u2014when they were 13, but now they're presumably older. If they are an adult, their autonomy is stronger. \n\nBut if they are still a minor, the parents' authority might override, but the question is phrased as \"WIBTA if I did it,\" implying they are an adult now. The response should consider that. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the person isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by taking the test themselves. However, the emotional impact on the family is significant. The mother's refusal to speak to them is a clear sign of distress. The father's sadness indicates he feels hurt. The person's justification is that they still consider their father their father, which shows they respect the family bond regardless of biology.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the person is overstepping by acting against the parents' wishes. If they are an adult, they have the right to seek this information, but they might be causing harm to their family. However, if they are not an adult, then the parents' decision might take precedence. Since the original post says \"I was around 13 (seven years ago)\" and now they're considering the test, they might be 20 now. Assuming they are an adult, their right to know their genetic information is stronger. \n\nIn many cases, people do have the right to pursue their own genetic testing, even if it might upset family members. However, the ethical dilemma is about balancing personal needs with family dynamics. The parents have a valid reason to be upset, but the person's need for self-awareness is also valid. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are seeking information about their own heritage, which is a personal right. However, they might need to handle it with more sensitivity, perhaps by communicating better or giving their parents time to process. But in terms of being in the wrong, it's not their fault for wanting to know. The parents made a decision, but the adult child has the autonomy to decide for themselves.\n"
