My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The parents had initially told the author about possible paternity issues due to the mother being sexually assaulted. They decided not to do a test and raised the author as their daughter. Now, the author wants to take a DNA test, which has upset the parents, especially the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision years ago to not pursue a paternity test, possibly to protect the family's emotional well-being. The author is now seeking answers for themselves, which is understandable given the trauma of the mother. But the parents might feel that their wishes are being disregarded. \n\nThe author's intention is to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relation to their cousin. But they also acknowledge the parents' stance. The parents, especially the mother, are upset and the father is sad. The author might be conflicted between their own need for truth and respecting their parents' decision.\n\nLegally, in many places, adults can make their own medical decisions, including genetic testing. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's more complex. The parents might have had reasons to avoid the test to maintain family stability. The author's desire for truth is valid, but they have to consider the emotional impact on their parents. However, the author is also dealing with their own unresolved feelings about their identity. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus family boundaries. The author has the right to seek information about their own genetic heritage, but doing so might breach the trust or agreements made by the parents. The parents might feel that their original decision to not pursue testing was a family decision, and the author going against it could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the author's right to self-determination could argue that they are not in the wrong. \n\nI should also consider if there's any prior agreement or if the author was part of the original decision. The parents made the choice seven years ago, and the author was 13 at the time, so they might not have had a say then. Now, as an adult, the author's right to make their own decisions is stronger. However, the emotional fallout for the parents is significant. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid reason to seek their genetic information, they might be in the wrong if they disregard their parents' wishes without understanding the reasons behind those wishes. But if they have considered the impact and still choose to proceed, their autonomy supports their decision. The answer hinges on the balance between personal rights and family respect.\n"
