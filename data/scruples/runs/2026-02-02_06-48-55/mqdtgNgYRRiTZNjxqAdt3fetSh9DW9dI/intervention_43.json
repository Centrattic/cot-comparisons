My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The parents mentioned uncertainty about the person's paternity due to a past assault. They chose not to test and want to raise the person as the father's daughter. The user's cousin already did the test, and they want to see their genetic makeup and check if they're related. The parents are upset, with the mother refusing to speak and the father being sad.\n\nHmm, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents made a decision to not pursue testing for their own reasons, possibly to protect the family dynamic. The author's desire to know their biological origins is valid, but the parents might feel disrespected by the child going against their wishes. The father's question about seeing him as a father even if not biological shows the author's intention isn't to reject the father but to seek truth. However, the parents might see the test as reopening old wounds or undermining their earlier decision. \n\nThere's a balance between the child's right to know their biological background and respecting the parents' wishes. The mother's reaction is extreme, but the father's sadness indicates the emotional toll. Legalities might vary, but emotionally, there's a conflict. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if it causes family strife, but their intent is personal discovery. It's a tough call. Some might argue the author isn't in the wrong because the desire for self-knowledge is a personal right, while others might say they should have respected the parents' decision. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent is personal and not to harm, but it's a close call.\n"
