My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves possible paternity issues due to the mother being assaulted when the author was conceived. The parents have decided not to test and are raising the author as their daughter, but the author wants to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm the relationship with their cousin. The parents reacted negatively, with the mom cutting off communication and the dad being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author's desire for self-knowledge and understanding their origins is a personal right. But the parents have their own reasons for not wanting the test, possibly to protect the author's feelings or to maintain family unity. The mother's trauma from the assault might play a role in her resistance. However, the author is now an adult (since they were 13 seven years ago), so their autonomy should be considered. \n\nIn many cases, adults have the right to pursue information about their genetic heritage. The parents might feel betrayed because they thought they had made a collective decision, but the author's feelings of being troubled by the uncertainty are valid. The author also clarified that even if the test shows a different biological father, they still see their dad as their father, which shows respect for the family dynamic. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author's actions seem reasonable. They're seeking personal truth without necessarily intending to harm, though the parents' reactions are hurtful. The key points are autonomy versus respect for parental decisions. Since the author is an adult, their right to autonomy might outweigh the parents' wishes. So the answer is likely B.\n"
