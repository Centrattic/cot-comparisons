I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's parents, especially the mother, were assaulted and there's some uncertainty about the author's paternity. The parents chose not to do a DNA test and raised the author as their daughter. Now the author is 20 (since it was seven years ago when they were 13), and they want to take a 23andMe test to find out their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relationship with their cousin, who already did the test. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who is now not speaking to the author, and the dad is sad. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding with the test against the parents' wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The parents had a traumatic experience with the assault, and they made a decision to move forward without testing. They prioritized the family's well-being, especially the author's upbringing. The author, on the other hand, is struggling with their identity and want for truth. \n\nLegally, in most places, once a person is an adult (assuming the author is 20 now, which is over the age of majority in many countries), they have the right to make decisions about their own genetic information. So the author might have a legal right to take the test. However, the emotional impact on the family is significant. The mother is upset and not speaking to the author, which shows deep hurt. The father is also sad. \n\nBut then, the author did express that they see their dad as their father regardless of biological ties. So they aren't trying to displace their dad but just seeking information for themselves. The parents might feel betrayed, but is the author in the wrong for wanting to know the truth? \n\nThere's a balance between respecting the parents' decision and the right to self-knowledge. The parents might have valid reasons for not wanting to disrupt the family dynamic, but the child's right to know their origins is also a considered a valid concern. \n\nIn some ethical frameworks, autonomy (the right to make one's own decisions) is valued highly, especially for adults. If the author is an adult, they might not be in the wrong. But if they are still a minor, it could be different. The scenario says seven years ago when they were 13, so now they'd be 20, so an adult. So the author might have the right to proceed. \n\nHowever, the parents' feelings and the potential for family disruption are also important. The author might not be in the wrong legally or ethically, but they might be causing emotional harm. However, the question is about whether they are \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment. \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because as an adult, they have the right to seek their own genetic information, and their desire for truth is a personal choice. The parents are dealing with their own trauma, but the author's actions aren't necessarily morally wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here because the parents' feelings are hurt. Maybe the answer is B, but it's a close call.\n"
