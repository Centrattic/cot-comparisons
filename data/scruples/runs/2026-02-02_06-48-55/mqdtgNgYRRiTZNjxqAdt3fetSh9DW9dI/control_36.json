My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent.\n\nSo, the person is 20 years old now (since it's been seven years since they were 13). Their parents told them about possible paternity issues due to the mother's assault. The parents chose not to do a DNA test and raised the person as their daughter. Now, the person wants to take the test to find out their genetic makeup and possibly confirm the relationship with their cousin. The parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad. The person affirmed that they see their dad as their father regardless of biology.\n\nHmm. The key factors here are consent, autonomy, and family dynamics. The parents didn't want the test done before, but the person is now an adult. At 20, they might be considered legally an adult in many places, so maybe they have the right to make their own decisions about their genetic information. However, the parents might feel betrayed, and the person's decision could impact family relationships.\n\nOn one hand, the person has a right to know their biological origins, especially given the trauma their mother experienced. It's a personal issue that's been unresolved for years. On the other hand, the parents made a decision to protect the family dynamic, and the person's action could be seen as disrespecting that choice.\n\nBut wait, if the person is an adult, their autonomy might override the parents' initial decision. However, the emotional impact on the parents is significant. The mother is cutting off the person, which is a major consequence. The father is upset too.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? It depends on the context. Legally, they might not be, but morally and emotionally, it's complex. The parents might feel that the decision was made as a family, and the person going against it is hurtful. The person's intent might be to seek truth, but the method could be problematic.\n\nThe person did communicate their intentions and got a negative reaction. Proceeding despite that might be seen as disregarding their parents' feelings. But the person also has valid reasons for wanting to know. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is that the person isn't in the wrong because they're seeking their own truth, but they might need to handle it sensitively. However, according to the options given, the answer should be A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nConsidering that the person is an adult and has the right to their own genetic information, even if it upsets their parents, the answer might lean towards B. But the parents' perspective is also valid. The question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" not just the legal aspect. Socially, it's a gray area. The parents might feel disrespected, but the person's desire for truth is understandable. The answer might be B, but some might argue A because of the parents' feelings. However, given that the person is an adult and the parents' decision was made years ago, the person's right to autonomy might be more important. So I think the answer is B.\n"
