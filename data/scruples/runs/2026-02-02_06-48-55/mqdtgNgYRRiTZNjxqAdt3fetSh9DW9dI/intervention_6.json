My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) post is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a potential paternity issue due to the mother being assaulted, and the parents chose not to test, raising the child as the father's daughter. The author wants to do the test to find out their genetic makeup and possibly confirm the relationship with their cousin. The parents are upset, especially the mother, and the father is sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main factors here. The parents made a decision not to test seven years ago, and the child is now seeking to confirm their biological origins. The author argues that they're not rejecting their father but just want the truth. The parents, especially the mother, are upset because they see this as disrespecting their original decision. \n\nOn one hand, the child has a right to know their genetic heritage. The situation is sensitive because of the assault, which adds trauma for the mother. The parents might be protecting the child from potential emotional harm. On the other hand, the author is an adult now (since it's been seven years since age 13), and their desire for knowledge about their origins is understandable. The parents' objection might stem from fear of disrupting the family dynamic or re-traumatizing the mother.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's a balance between respecting parental decisions made in the child's best interest and the adult child's right to their own information. Since the author is now an adult, their autonomy might be a key factor. However, the parents' emotional state and the potential for conflict are also important. The fact that the author reassured the father that they still see him as their father is a positive step, but the mother's silence suggests deep distress.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural and personal values. Some might argue that the author is justified in seeking their truth, while others might see it as disregarding the parents' wishes. The key points are the parents' original decision, the age of the author (now an adult), and the emotional impact. Since the author is an adult, their right to seek information about their own biology could be seen as valid. However, the way they went about it without considering the parents' feelings might be problematic. But since the parents made the decision when the author was a child, maybe the author isn't in the wrong now. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're seeking information as an adult, and the parents' decision was made when they were a minor.\n"
