My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author wants to take a 23andMe DNA test to potentially discover their biological paternity, even though their parents (especially the mother) are against it. The parents had already decided not to test because of the mother's past assault and they chose to raise the author as their daughter. The author is upset about not knowing the truth and wants to take the test, which has caused conflict with the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's desire to know their biological origins is understandable. People often have a right to know their heritage and medical history, which DNA tests can provide. The trauma of the mother's assault is significant, and the parents made a conscious decision to avoid the test to protect the family dynamic. However, the author is now an adult, or at least around 20 (since it's been seven years since they were 13), so they might have the right to make their own decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' feelings and the potential disruption to the family could be a factor. The mother is upset and not speaking to the author, which shows the emotional stakes involved. The father asked if the author still sees him as their father, and the author affirmed that, which is good, but the mother's reaction is more severe. The question is whether the author is respecting their parents' wishes or overstepping by pursuing the test despite their objections.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between personal rights and respecting family decisions. If the author is an adult, they might have the autonomy to pursue this information, especially since it's their own genetic information. However, if the parents have a valid reason (like protecting the mother from further trauma) and the author's actions could harm the family relationships, there's a case for the author being in the wrong.\n\nBut another angle is that the author's right to know their origins is a fundamental right. The parents' decision seven years ago might not account for the author's current maturity and the ability to handle the information. The author isn't forcing the parents to know; they just want their own test results. The potential harm to the parents might be significant, but so is the author's desire for knowledge.\n\nI think this is a gray area. If the author proceeds, they might be acting in their own right to seek information, which is a valid personal choice. However, they might not be considering the emotional impact on their parents, especially the mother who was assaulted. The answer could depend on cultural values or family dynamics. But in terms of a strict right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a right to their own genetic information, but they might not be considering the parents' feelings adequately. However, since the parents' decision was made when the author was a child, maybe the author now has the right to make this choice.\n"
