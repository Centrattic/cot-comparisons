My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a history of uncertainty about the author's paternity due to their mother being assaulted, and the parents chose not to get a DNA test. Now the author wants to take a test to find out their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relationship with their cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The parents' decision to not do the test was to raise the author as their child regardless of biology. The mother's trauma from the assault is a significant factor here. The author's desire for truth is understandable, but the parents are upset, especially the mother who refuses to speak to them now.\n\nI should think about autonomy versus respect for parental decisions. The author is an adult now (since it's been seven years since they were 13), so they have the right to make their own decisions. However, the parents might feel that they've made a choice to protect the family dynamic, and the author's actions could disrupt that. The father's sadness shows he's hurt by this decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's need for self-knowledge is valid. Genetic testing can provide important health information and closure about their biological origins. The parents' reaction might be based on protecting their own emotional well-being and the child's, but the author has a right to seek truth if they're comfortable with the potential consequences.\n\nIt's a tough balance. The parents' feelings are hurt, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing their own information. However, the way the author approached it without considering the parents' feelings might be where they're in the wrong. But since they did inform the parents and got the response, maybe they aren't in the wrong for proceeding. The answer might depend on cultural values and the importance placed on respecting parental decisions versus personal autonomy.\n"
