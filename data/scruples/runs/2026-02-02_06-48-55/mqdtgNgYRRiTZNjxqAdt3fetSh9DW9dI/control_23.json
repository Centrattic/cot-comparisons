I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves uncertainty about paternity due to a past sexual assault. The parents decided not to test, choosing to raise the person as their daughter. Now the author wants to take the test, possibly to confirm their genetic relationships, including with their cousin. The parents are upset, with the mom being upset and the dad sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision seven years ago when the person was 13. At that age, they might not have had the autonomy to make such a decision. Now, the person is older and seeking their own genetic information. The parents might feel that their decision to protect the child from potential distress by not testing is being disregarded.\n\nHowever, the right to know one's genetic information is a personal right. The author has a valid reason for wanting the test\u2014not just for paternity but also to understand their genetic makeup. The parents' objection could be based on their desire to maintain the family structure they chose, but the author's autonomy and right to self-determination might weigh more now, especially as an adult.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the parent's consent. When the person was a minor, the parents had more authority, but as an adult, the individual has more control over their own medical and genetic decisions. The parents' reaction might stem from fear of the test results affecting their relationship with the child or each other.\n\nBut there's a potential for harm here. The test could reveal information that the parents and the author are not emotionally prepared for, such as the confirmation of non-paternity, which might strain the family dynamics further. However, the author has already experienced emotional distress due to the uncertainty, and seeking clarity could be beneficial for their mental health.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a key principle. The author has the right to make decisions about their own body and genetic information. The parents' wish to protect them might be well-intended but could be seen as overstepping now that the author is an adult. However, the way the author proceeded by informing the parents first might not have been the best approach, as it led to conflict. Perhaps a more sensitive approach would have been to consider the parents' concerns before proceeding, but the author's desire for information is also valid.\n\nIn some legal systems, a person can choose to undergo genetic testing as an adult, even if family members object. However, this varies by jurisdiction. Ethically, it's a balance between respecting family decisions made in the past and the individual's current right to information.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their actions are driven by a desire for their own information and understanding, which is a personal right. However, the way they handled the communication with their parents could have been better, but that doesn't make the decision itself wrong. The parents' feelings are important, but the author's autonomy is also a significant factor here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
