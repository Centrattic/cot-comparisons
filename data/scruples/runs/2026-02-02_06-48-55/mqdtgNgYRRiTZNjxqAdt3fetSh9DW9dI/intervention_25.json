My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation is about paternity uncertainty due to past assault and the parents choosing not to test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The parents made a decision seven years ago to not test and raise the child as their own. Now the person is an adult, and they want to take a DNA test to find out their biological origins. The parents are upset, especially the mother, who is cutting off communication.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and consent. The person is an adult, so they have the right to make decisions about their own body and genetic information. However, the parents' feelings and the family dynamics are important. The father seems to be sad but still acknowledged as the parent regardless of biology. The mother's reaction is more extreme, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nLegally, in many places, an adult can consent to their own DNA testing without needing parental permission. So from a legal standpoint, the person isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. While the person has a right to their genetic information, they might have hurt their parents' feelings by going against their wishes. However, the parents' decision was made when the person was a child, and now they're seeking answers as an adult, which is a different context.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and respect. The parents wanted to protect the family's stability by not testing, but the person feels the need for personal knowledge. The father's question about being seen as the father shows that the person's intention isn't to reject the father but to understand their own origins.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the person's actions are about their right to know their genetic background, while the parents' upset is about respecting their past decision. The person isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might have mishandled the communication with their parents. The answer would depend on prioritizing the individual's autonomy versus respecting parental wishes. Since the person is an adult and the parents' decision was from when they were a minor, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
