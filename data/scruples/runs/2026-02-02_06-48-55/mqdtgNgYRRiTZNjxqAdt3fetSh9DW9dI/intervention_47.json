I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent, despite the parents' objections.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was 13 when their parents mentioned uncertainty about paternity due to the mother being sexually assaulted. They were told to raise them as the father's daughter. Now, the person wants to do a DNA test to see their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relationship with their cousin (who is the father's sister's son, so should be a cousin if the father is their biological father). The parents, especially the mother, are upset and have stopped speaking to them. The question is whether the person is in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision seven years ago not to test and to raise the child as their own. The person is now seeking to uncover a truth that was kept hidden, possibly for their own good. The parents might have had reasons for not wanting to test, maybe to protect the child from potential family turmoil, or to avoid the child's biological father (if that's the case). \n\nOn the other hand, the person is an adult now (assuming the test was done when they were 20, since 13+7=20). They have the right to know their biological heritage. The mother's assault is a traumatic event, and the child might be dealing with their identity and origins, which is a valid emotional need. \n\nBut the parents are upset because they made a choice not to pursue testing. The person might be seen as going against their parents' wishes, even if their intentions are personal. The father's sadness suggests that this is a significant issue for the family. However, the person isn't necessarily being disrespectful; they're seeking answers about their own identity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, if the person is an adult, they can choose to take a DNA test. But ethically, they might be disregarding their parents' decision, which could cause family rifts. However, the right to know one's biological origins is a common argument in such cases. \n\nSo, I'm torn. If the parents had made a firm decision and communicated it clearly, the child might be expected to respect that to maintain family harmony. But if the child feels the need for the information for their own well-being, that's also important. Since the parents didn't take action when the situation arose (seven years ago), maybe the child is justified in seeking answers now. \n\nIn some cases, people argue that the right to self-determination includes knowing one's origins. Others might say that respecting parental decisions is more important. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Given that the parents are upset and it's causing a rift, but the person's intent is to understand their own identity, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong). But I can see valid points on both sides.\n"
