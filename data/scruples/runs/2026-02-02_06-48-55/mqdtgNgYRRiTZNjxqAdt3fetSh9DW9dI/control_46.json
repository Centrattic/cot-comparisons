My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering taking a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections, especially because of a possible paternity issue from their mother's sexual assault. The parents decided not to test, but the author has been troubled by the uncertainty for years.\n\nFirst, the main ethical question is whether the author is wrong to proceed. The parents argue it's their decision, but the author wants to know the truth about their origins. The mother was assaulted, which complicates things. The parents raised the author as their daughter, but the author's desire for genetic information is also valid.\n\nThe parents' reaction seems to be about maintaining the family's decision and possibly protecting the author from potential emotional turmoil. However, the author has a right to their own genetic information. The father's sadness and the mother cutting off communication suggest emotional impact, but does that make the author wrong? Or is it about the right to self-determination versus respecting parental wishes?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, minors might not have the authority to make such decisions, but the author is an adult now (since it's seven years since age 13). Adults typically have the right to seek their own medical information, including genetic data. The parents' stance could be seen as overstepping if the author is an adult making an informed choice. However, there's a cultural aspect too\u2014some families might view this as a breach of trust.\n\nThe cousin already did the test, so the author isn't the first in the family to seek such information. The parent's reaction might also be influenced by their own unresolved issues from the past. The author's statement that they accept their dad as their father regardless of biology shows they're not seeking to disrupt the family structure but just seeking personal truth.\n\nSo, considering autonomy, the right to know one's origins, and the age of the author (assuming they're 20+), the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, the parents' feelings are valid, but the author's decision is a personal matter. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
