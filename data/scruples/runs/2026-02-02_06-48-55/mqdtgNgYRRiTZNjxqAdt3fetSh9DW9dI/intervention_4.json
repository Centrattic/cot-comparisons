My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent, especially since their parents previously told them not to test due to paternity uncertainty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's parents had already decided not to test, and the mother was assaulted, which complicates things. The parents chose to raise the author as their daughter regardless. The author feels conflicted because they want to know their genetic makeup and possibly their relation to the cousin who also tested. The parents reacted negatively, with the mother cutting off communication and the father being sad.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in some places, a minor might not have the right to do a DNA test without parental consent, but the author is now 20 (since they were 13 seven years ago). Assuming they're an adult, the legal aspect might not be the main issue here. The ethical and familial aspects are more important.\n\nThe parents made a decision for the family's well-being. The author's desire for self-knowledge is understandable, but the parents' feelings and their decision to move past the traumatic event might be hurt by the author's actions. The author's father even asked if they still see him as their father, and the author affirmed that, which shows they respect the family structure. However, the parents might feel that the test undermines their commitment to raise the author regardless of biology.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their own genetic information, especially if it's about their own health and heritage. There's also the argument that the author's autonomy is important, and the parents' decision from years ago might not account for the author's current emotional needs.\n\nBut since the parents specifically said not to test, the author's action could be seen as disregarding their parents' wishes, which might be a breach of trust. The mother's reaction is extreme, but her trauma from the assault and the decision to protect the child might be significant factors. The father's sadness suggests he feels hurt by the author's choice despite the author's affirmation of his role.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a tough call. However, the author did go ahead despite the parents' explicit opposition. Even if the author has valid reasons, acting against the family's previous agreement might be seen as inconsiderate. The parents might need time to process and the author's action could reopen old wounds. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here. But if the author's decision is about their own health and identity, that's a different angle. But since the main issue is about paternity and the parents' wishes, the author might be overstepping. So leaning towards A.\n"
