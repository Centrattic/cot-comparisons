My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent, especially since there's an unresolved paternity issue from when they were 13. The parents didn't want to test then, and now the author wants to take the test both to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their relation to the cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The parents made a decision to raise the author as their daughter despite the uncertainty. The mother is upset now because the author is going against their earlier decision. The father is sad but still acknowledged as the parent. The author's intention is to find out the truth about their biological parentage, which they've been struggling with for years.\n\nOn one hand, the parents might feel disrespected because they asked not to do the test. The mother's reaction is severe, even cutting off communication. The father's sadness suggests emotional impact. But on the other hand, the author has a right to their own genetic information and identity. The trauma from the mother's assault and the lack of closure might make the author's actions understandable.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. In many cases, adults have the right to seek medical or genetic information about themselves, even if family members are uncomfortable. The parents' decision seven years ago might have been based on their own reasons, but the author is now an adult and making their own choice. The key point is the author's age and autonomy. At 13, possibly underage, but now seven years later, they're likely 20 or older, so they can make their own decisions.\n\nAlso, the author's cousin already did the test, which might have prompted the author's desire. The author's statement to the father shows they respect him regardless of the biological results. This could mitigate the parents' feelings because the author isn't rejecting them but seeking truth for personal knowledge.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family harmony. The mother's refusal to speak to the author could be a significant consequence. The author might be causing emotional harm, even with good intentions. However, the mother's reaction is extreme, maybe because she's still dealing with the trauma of the assault. The author's right to know their origins is a strong counterpoint.\n\nIn legal terms, the parents can't stop an adult child from taking a genetic test. Ethically, it's a bit more nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong for seeking their own information, but they should consider the potential emotional impact on their parents. The parents' wishes were set when the author was a minor, but now as an adult, the author has a different set of rights and considerations.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to know their biological heritage as an adult, even if the parents previously didn't want to test. The parents' current objections might be valid in terms of family dynamics, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing the test. It's a sensitive situation, but the author's autonomy is a key factor here.\n"
