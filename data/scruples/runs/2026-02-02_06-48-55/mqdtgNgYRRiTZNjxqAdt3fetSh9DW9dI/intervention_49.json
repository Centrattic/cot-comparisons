My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves paternity uncertainty due to the mother being assaulted, and the parents chose not to test. The author wants to know their genetic makeup and possibly confirm paternity, which upsets the parents. The parents, especially the mother, are against it and are upset, while the father is sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parents made a decision seven years ago to not test and raise the author as their daughter. The author is now 20 (since it was seven years ago when they were 13) and wants to take the test. The key issue is whether the author's actions are respectful of their parents' wishes.\n\nThe author's parents, particularly the mother, are upset because they view it as disrespecting their decision. The father is sad but still acknowledges his role. The mother is even cutting off communication. The author is seeking answers for themselves, which is understandable, but the parents' boundaries are being crossed here. \n\nThe mother was assaulted, which is a traumatic experience. The parents chose to protect the author from that trauma. The author's desire for truth is valid, but it's important to weigh that against the parents' right to make decisions in the child's best interest, especially after experiencing such a traumatic event.\n\nIn terms of autonomy, the author is an adult now, but the parents' initial decision was made when the author was a minor. There's a balance between the author's right to know their biological origins and respecting the parents' wishes. The author might argue that they have the right to know their genetic makeup, but the parents might see it as a violation of their agreement to protect the family from that information.\n\nIt's also about respecting family dynamics. The mother's refusal to speak to the author is a significant consequence. The parents might have had good reasons for not testing, such as protecting the author from potential family conflict or the trauma of knowing the truth. The author's actions could reopen old wounds and cause further harm to the family.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings of not knowing the truth are legitimate. They have a right to their genetic information, but they might have a responsibility to consider their parents' feelings and the family's well-being. The fact that the author assured the father of his importance as a parent shows some consideration, but the parents' stance is firm.\n\nIn such cases, it's often about the intent and the consequences. The author's intent is to seek personal knowledge and possibly confirm their relationship with their cousin. But the consequence is causing significant distress to their parents. The parents' decision was made with the child's best interest in mind, and the author going against it might be seen as disregarding that.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're acting on their own desire for information without considering the emotional impact on their parents, who were already in a vulnerable position. The parents' decision to not test was a protective measure, and the author's actions could be seen as undermining that decision. Even though the author is an adult, the parents' feelings and the family's well-being are important to consider. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
