My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person wants to take a 23andMe test to check their genetic makeup and possibly confirm their paternity. Their parents, especially the mother, are against it because they had agreed not to do a test. The parent's reason is that they want to raise the child as their own, even though there might be uncertainty about the paternity due to a past assault. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. The parent's decision years ago was to avoid testing and maintain the status quo. The child now is an adult (since they were 13 seven years ago) and wants to pursue genetic testing. The parents feel that this is going against their original decision and might disrupt the family dynamic. \n\nOn one hand, the parents have a right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, but once the child becomes an adult, their autonomy might take precedence. The author is now an adult making their own decisions. The mother's reaction is extreme (won't speak), and the father is sad. The key point is whether the author's action is a betrayal of the parents' wishes or a valid exercise of personal autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author clarifies that they still see their father as their father regardless of the test results. This shows they aren't trying to undermine the parent's role but seek personal knowledge. The parents might be worried about the emotional impact if the test reveals a different biological father. But the author's desire to know their genetic heritage is a personal right.\n\nIn some cases, genetic testing can have significant family implications, but if the author is an adult and the parents aren't in a position to force them not to take the test, the author's right to seek information could outweigh the parents' wishes. However, if the parents are still legally guardians (if the author is a minor), that would change things, but since they were 13 seven years ago, the author is now 20, so an adult. \n\nSo the ethical stance here might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to their own genetic information. The parents' decision from years ago was based on their wishes at the time, but the adult child's autonomy is a factor. However, there's also the aspect of respecting the parents' wishes and the potential emotional impact on the family. \n\nBut considering that the author is an adult and the parents can't legally stop them, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but they need to handle it with sensitivity. The parents' feelings are valid, but the author's right to know their own biology is also a consideration. So the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
