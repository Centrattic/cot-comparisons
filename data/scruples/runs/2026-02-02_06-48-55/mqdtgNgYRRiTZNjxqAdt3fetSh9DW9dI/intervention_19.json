My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for getting a 23andMe test without their parents' consent, especially since their parents don't want them to. The parents have a history of not confirming paternity due to a past assault, and the author wants to know their genetic makeup and if they're related to their cousin. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parents have already decided not to do a test, and the mother is upset. The father is sad but acknowledges his role. The author's main motivation is to find out their biological background, which has been a long-standing issue since they were 13. The key here is whether the author's desire for personal knowledge overrides the parents' wishes.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, as the author is an adult now (since it's been seven years since they were 13), they have the legal right to make their own medical and genetic decisions. However, there's the emotional and familial aspect. The parents might have chosen to protect the author from potential family tensions or trauma by not taking the test. The author's action could potentially disrupt the family dynamic and confirm a truth that the parents have chosen to avoid for everyone's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to know their own genetic information is a significant factor. The situation is complex because the parent's decision was made without the author's input, and the author is now seeking closure and truth. But respecting the parents' wishes could be seen as part of maintaining family harmony, especially since the parent in question is still considered the father regardless of biology.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Even if the author is an adult, the parents might feel that the test could reveal information that affects them (like the mother's assault) and that they should have a say. However, the author might argue that their own genetic information is their right to access, and the parents' objections are about controlling that information rather than the author's well-being.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't doing something illegal, but they are disregarding the parents' wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's need for truth and the fact that the parents didn't address the issue when the author was younger might tip the balance in favor of the author's right to know. The parents' reaction might be more about protecting their own decisions and the family's peace rather than the author's best interest.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a tough call. But since the author is an adult and has the right to make their own decisions, even if it goes against the parents' wishes, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on the family is significant, so the author should consider the potential consequences carefully.\n"
