I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person wants to take a 23andMe test to check their paternity because their parents never did a test even though there was a possible non-biological parent due to a sexual assault. The parents don't want them to do the test, and the author is conflicted about whether proceeding would be wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They chose not to test and agreed to raise the author as their daughter regardless. They might feel that the author is disregarding their decision by wanting to test now. The mother is upset, and the father is sad. The parents might be protecting each other's feelings, especially if the mother was the victim of a sexual assault. Testing could reopen old wounds or create tension within the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult now (assuming they're 20 if they were 13 seven years ago), and they have a right to know their biological origins. The situation was mentioned to them when they were 13, which is a vulnerable age, and not knowing might have caused them emotional distress. Taking the test could be a way for them to seek closure or understanding about their identity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is respecting their parents' wishes by proceeding. The parents might feel that their decision to not test was final, so the author going ahead despite their objections could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the author is an adult, they have autonomy over their own medical decisions, including genetic testing. The parents might not have the authority to stop an adult child from getting a test that affects them directly.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. If the parents are still emotionally tied to the issue, the test could cause more harm than good. The author might not be in the wrong in seeking their own truth, but they might have a responsibility to consider their parents' feelings and the potential impact on family relationships. Maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing it more carefully or finding a way to get the information without confrontation.\n\nHowever, the author already tried to talk to the parents and got a negative reaction. The parents might not be open to the idea now. In that case, is the author's desire to know their own biology more important than the parents' wishes? It's a tough balance. In some cases, the right to know one's origins is considered fundamental, especially when it's about possible non-biological parentage. But the method of how the author goes about it could matter. If they do it secretly, that might be more problematic than if they openly confront the issue.\n\nIn this case, the author said they told their parents and the parents freaked out. So it's not a secret test. The author is aware of the parents' position and is still choosing to proceed. So the question is whether proceeding despite the parents' known objections is wrong. If the parents have a valid reason (like wanting to protect each other or avoid trauma), the author might be disregarding their family's emotional well-being. But if the author's need for self-knowledge is valid, then maybe it's not wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between individual rights and family dynamics. Since the author is an adult, they have the right to make decisions about their own genetic testing. However, doing so in a way that respects their parents' feelings and the potential consequences might be necessary. But the parents might feel it's disrespectful regardless. The key is whether the author is wrong in the action itself or in the disregard of their parents' feelings.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For This) framework, people often consider intentions and consequences. The author's intention is to find closure, which is understandable. However, the act of going against the parents' wishes might be seen as disrespectful, even if the intention is good. So, depending on the cultural or familial context, the answer could vary. But in many cases, respecting the parents' decision is expected if they have made it clear that they oppose the test for valid reasons.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because they are going against their parents' wishes despite being aware of the emotional impact. But if the parents knew from the start that this uncertainty was a possibility and didn't address it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for seeking the truth now. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to their genetic information. However, the way they proceed (not considering the parents' emotional state) might be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
