My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test without their parents' consent, specifically when there's a history of paternity uncertainty. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 13 years old now, so they were 20 when the post was written. They mentioned that their parents didn't do a paternity test even though there was uncertainty due to their mother being sexually assaulted. The parents chose to raise the author as their daughter regardless. Now the author wants to take a DNA test to find out their genetic makeup and possibly their relation to their cousin. The parents are upset, with the mother refusing to speak and the father being sad.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate. Let's consider different angles. Legally, in many places, adults can get their own DNA tests. Since the author is 20, they're an adult, so maybe it's their right. But emotionally, the parents might have valid reasons for not wanting the test. The mother was assaulted, so the test could reopen old wounds or cause family tension. The father is concerned about being seen as not the biological parent, even though the author affirmed him as their father.\n\nBut the author also has a right to know their own genetic information. The parents made a decision for them when they were a child, but now the author is an adult seeking answers. The parents' objection might be about control rather than the author's well-being. However, acting against the parents' wishes could hurt them, especially the mother.\n\nEthically, it's a balance between the author's autonomy and the parents' wishes. If the author is an adult, they have the right to make their own decisions. The parents might feel disrespected, but the author's desire for information is also valid. However, the mother's trauma adds another layer\u2014she might not want the child to know about the assault again. The cousin's test might have already revealed some truths, so the author's test could just confirm what others know.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's insistence on the test despite the parents' clear objections could be seen as dismissive of their feelings. Even if legally allowed, the emotional impact on the family must be considered. The father's question about being seen as a father shows he's worried about the relationship. The author acknowledging that doesn't negate the parents' feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author respects their parents' wishes despite their own desire, maybe not. But since they're an adult, they have the right to pursue their own genetic information. However, the way they're doing it (without considering the emotional impact) might be the issue. It's a tricky balance. The answer might depend on cultural values and the specific family dynamics. In some views, going against parental wishes shows disrespect, but others prioritize individual autonomy. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're an adult with the right to know their genetic history, but it's a close call. However, the parents' emotional state is important, so maybe the author should have had a more sensitive approach. Still, the core of the issue is their right to the test versus the parents' feelings. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
