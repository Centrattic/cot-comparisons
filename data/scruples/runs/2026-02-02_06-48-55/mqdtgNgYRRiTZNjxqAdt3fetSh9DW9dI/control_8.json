My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to do a 23andMe test without their parents' consent. The situation involves the parents not wanting to confirm the author's paternity because the mother was sexually assaulted around the time of conception, and they chose to raise the author as the father's daughter. Now, the author wants to take the test to know their genetic makeup and check if they're related to their cousin who already did the test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The parents' decision seven years ago was to avoid testing and maintain the father as the official parent. The author is now older, 20 if they were 13 seven years ago. At that age, they might have more autonomy. However, the parents are upset, especially the mother, who is not speaking to them. The father is sad and asked if they see him as their father, to which the author replied affirmatively, respecting their father's role regardless of biology.\n\nLegally, in most places, once someone is an adult, they can make their own medical decisions, including genetic testing. So the author isn't breaking any laws. But the question is about being in the wrong in terms of morality or social expectations. The parents feel disrespected, so the author might be causing emotional pain. However, the author's desire for truth and self-knowledge is also valid. There's a conflict between the parents' wish to protect their family dynamic and the author's right to know their biological origins.\n\nThe key points here are consent, the parents' initial agreement to not test, and the impact of the author's actions on family relationships. The author's decision to proceed could be seen as self-justified because they're an adult now, but it might also be considered disrespectful to the parents' wishes. The answer likely depends on cultural values and the specific family values. In some perspectives, the child has a right to know, while others prioritize respecting parental decisions. The parents' trauma from the assault might add another layer, making the test a sensitive issue. The author might not be in the wrong legally or morally, as they're seeking information about their own identity, but the emotional consequences could be significant. The answer is probably B (No), but need to check if there's a stronger case for A (Yes). Since the parents' decision was to not test, but the author is now an adult and the test is their own choice, it's a matter of autonomy versus family wishes. The author is not in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
