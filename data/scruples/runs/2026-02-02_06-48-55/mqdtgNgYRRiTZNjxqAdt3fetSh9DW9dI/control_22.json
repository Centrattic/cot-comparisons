My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is wrong for wanting to take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation involves a possible paternity issue from the mother's assault. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as their daughter. The author wants to know their genetic makeup and check if they're related to their cousin who did the test. The parents are upset, especially the mom, and the dad is sad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author is an adult now (since it's seven years since they were 13), so they might have autonomy over their own body and decisions. The parents' objection is based on their previous decision to avoid the test. But the author has a right to their own genetic information, which is a personal matter. The assault on the mother adds a layer of trauma, so the parents might be protecting themselves and the author from potential emotional pain. However, the author is clearly troubled by the uncertainty and wants clarity for themselves. The father's question about being seen as the father, and the author's affirmation, shows that the relationship isn't about biology for the author, but the desire for personal knowledge is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that the author is disregarding their wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful. But given that the author is an adult, the parents' authority might not extend to this decision anymore. The key points are autonomy, the right to know one's genetic origins, and the potential emotional impact on the family. The author isn't causing harm but seeking their own truth. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
