My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to take a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections. The situation is about paternity uncertainty due to the mother being sexually assaulted. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as their daughter. Now the author wants to take the test to know their genetic makeup and confirm relation to their cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents made a decision to not test, and the author is going against that. The mother is upset and won't speak to them, the dad is sad. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to know their biological origins, especially given the traumatic history. The parents' decision was made to protect them, but the author feels it's important to know the truth now. On the other hand, the parents' wishes were to not pursue testing, and the author is disregarding that. The parents might see it as a breach of trust or going against their decision.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of autonomy. As an adult, the author might have the right to make their own decisions about their genetic information. The parents' initial decision was seven years ago when the author was 13, and they might not consider the author's current feelings. The mother's assault was a traumatic event, and the parents chose to create a stable family environment. The author's desire to know could be seen as valid, even if it upsets the parents.\n\nHowever, the parents are still part of the author's life, and the author's actions might cause significant emotional harm. The mother is cutting off contact, which is a big consequence. The father is sad, indicating emotional impact. The author might be prioritizing their need for information over their family's feelings.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Laws vary, but in many places, once you're an adult, you can consent to your own genetic testing. The parents can't legally stop you. Ethically, it's more complex. The author is in a position where they have the right to their own DNA but also a responsibility to consider family dynamics. The parents might feel betrayed, but the author's need for truth is a personal right. It's a conflict between personal autonomy and family respect.\n\nIn some cases, people argue that genetic information is personal and the right to know overrides others' decisions. However, the parents' decision was made with the author's best interest in mind, and the author is challenging that. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But generally, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking their own genetic information as an adult. However, emotionally, it's a tough situation. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because it's their right to know, even if it causes family conflict.\n"
