My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for doing a 23andMe test despite their parents' objections.\n\nThe main points are: The parents, especially the mother, were assaulted, and there's uncertainty about the author's paternity. The parents chose not to test and raised the author as their daughter. Now the author wants to take a DNA test, possibly to confirm the relationship with their cousin and to know their genetic makeup. The parents are upset, with the mother cutting off communication, and the father is sad. The author says it's important to them but acknowledges the parents' feelings.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author has a right to their own genetic information. They've been conflicted about their paternity for years, and the test could provide closure. On the other hand, the parents made a decision to not pursue testing, possibly to protect the family's emotional well-being, especially given the traumatic history of assault. The mother's reaction suggests deep emotional distress, which might be tied to the trauma of the assault and the decision to move forward without testing.\n\nHowever, the author's desire for truth and self-understanding is also valid. Genetic testing is a personal choice, and the parents' objection might stem from fear of disrupting the family dynamic they've maintained. But the author is an adult now (since it's seven years since they were 13), so they have autonomy over their own decisions. The parents' stance on it being their decision might not hold as strongly if the author is an adult. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're seeking personal truth and closure, which is a legitimate desire. However, their actions might cause pain to their parents, which is unfortunate but not entirely their fault if they've been considering this for years. The key here is the age difference and the fact that the parents' decision was made when the author was a child, not an adult making their own choices. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), as the author has the right to pursue their genetic information as an adult, even if it upsets their parents.\n"
