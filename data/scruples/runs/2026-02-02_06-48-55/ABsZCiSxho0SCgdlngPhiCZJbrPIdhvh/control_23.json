      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is at fault for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for that decision.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be vegetarian. The key points here are that they're not imposing their views on others, just making their own event reflect their dietary preferences. \n\nNow, considering the options. Answer A says they're in the wrong, B says they're not. The user's reasoning is that their wedding is their day, and they want to avoid something they find unpleasant. They're not forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Wedding guests usually expect that the hosts have some preferences, and while some might want meat options, the hosts have the right to decide their menu. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that guests could have dietary restrictions that require meat. However, the question states that the couple is vegetarian and doesn't have an issue with others eating meat outside the wedding. So they probably considered that guests can bring their own food if needed, though that's not typical. Also, offering only vegetarian food doesn't mean they're against meat, just their own preferences. \n\nIn many cultures, it's common for the wedding to accommodate the hosts' preferences. So unless there's a cultural expectation that weddings must have meat, the couple is within their rights. Plus, they're not making it a strict policy but just for their specific event. \n\nAnother angle: if guests have dietary needs, they might need to inform the couple beforehand. But the couple isn't refusing to accommodate, they're just not serving meat. So they aren't at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
