      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell and look of it gross, even though they don't mind others eating meat otherwise. The question is whether serving only vegetarian food at their wedding makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since both the author and their partner are vegetarians, it makes sense they'd want the food to align with their lifestyle. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, just prefer not to have it on their special day. \n\nBut some might argue that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. However, the scenario doesn't mention any guests with dietary restrictions beyond the couple's vegetarianism. Also, the couple isn't forcing their guests to eat vegetarian; they\u2019re just choosing the menu for their own event. It's their day, so they have the right to set their own preferences unless there were prior commitments or specific requests from guests that weren't addressed.\n\nOn the other hand, if some guests are non-vegetarian, they might feel excluded or that their preferences aren't respected. But the couple isn't imposing their choice on others; they're simply not serving meat. They could offer vegetarian options, which they are, so guests can choose to eat what's provided. The key point here is that the couple is making their personal choice for their event, which is generally acceptable. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. Considering that the couple isn't forcing their guests to eat vegetarian, and they\u2019re making their own preferences clear without judgment, it seems reasonable. The main issue might be if the wedding had previously promised meat options, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to host their wedding as they see fit, especially when it aligns with their personal values and comfort. Unless there's a breach of prior agreements or ignoring guests' specific needs (which aren't mentioned here), their choice is valid.\n"
