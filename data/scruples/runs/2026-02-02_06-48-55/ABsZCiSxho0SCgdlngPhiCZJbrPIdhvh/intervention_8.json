      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't say anything to others when they eat meat around them, but they want their wedding to have no meat. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for not offering meat options at their reception.\n\nFirst, I should consider the couple's perspective. They're making choices based on their personal preferences and values. Since they're strict vegetarians, it makes sense they'd want their wedding to reflect their dietary choices. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually make decisions based on their preferences. It's their day, after all.\n\nHowever, some guests might not be vegetarian and could be uncomfortable without meat options. But the couple mentions they don't have an issue with others eating meat in general\u2014they just prefer not to have it on their wedding day. They also don't comment on others eating around them, so it's not like they're being judgmental. They're making a choice for their own event, which is a common thing in weddings.\n\nI should also think about common practices. Many couples choose specific types of food for their weddings\u2014vegan, gluten-free, etc.\u2014based on their preferences. Guests usually come with the understanding that the menu might reflect the couple's tastes. If the wedding is vegetarian, it's not unreasonable. Plus, the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not offering meat. If guests are concerned about their options, they might bring their own food, but that's not typical. However, it's their event, so the choice is theirs.\n\nAnother angle is whether the couple is being considerate. If they're aware that many of their guests might not be vegetarian, they might want to offer some non-meat options. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only menu. Since they're not forcing guests to eat something, but rather not offering something, it's more about their right to choose their own wedding's menu.\n\nI think the key points are that it's the couple's event, they're not being discriminatory (as they don't have a problem with meat in general, just personal preference), and they're not actively providing meat. So, they're making a choice that aligns with their lifestyle for their special day. Therefore, the answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
