      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat in general but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is if they're at fault (AITA) for not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The couple has the right to choose their own preferences for their event. Weddings are personal, so they can set the menu as they like. However, guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences they weren't expecting. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. It's their venue, after all.\n\nI should also think about whether they communicated this to guests. If they made it clear in the invitation or during planning, guests can adjust. Maybe some guests are vegetarians too, which aligns. But if meat-eating guests can't have their usual food, that might cause issues. But the couple isn't offering meat, just not including it. So maybe guests can have other options or bring their own. However, that's not usually expected.\n\nAnother angle: the couple isn't being exclusionary beyond their own preferences. They don't have a problem with others eating meat, just not on their day. Their reason is about personal comfort with the smell or look, which is a valid reason for them. It's not about judging others, just their own event.\n\nSo, in terms of being wrong, I think the answer is B (No). It's their right to have a vegetarian menu if they choose, especially since they're not imposing it on others beyond not serving meat. They can still offer other non-meat options, maybe even a variety of vegetarian dishes. The key is that it's their wedding, and they have the autonomy to decide the menu. Unless there's a specific guest with a medical need that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, it's a personal choice.\n"
