      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when other people eat meat around them but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if hosting a vegetarian-only wedding is reasonable. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts can make choices based on their preferences. Since they're both vegetarian, it makes sense they'd prefer vegetarian food. But they should also consider guests who might have dietary restrictions or preferences for meat. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is intent. The hosts are not imposing vegetarianism on others; they're choosing their own event's menu. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian food. They're just avoiding meat to keep their own comfort. People can bring their own food if they need to. But in reality, guests usually accommodate the hosts' choices. \n\nI think the hosts have a right to make this choice. They're not being inconsiderate because they're not serving meat, but they're not forcing anyone to eat it either. Maybe offering some non-meat options would help, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since they\u2019re both strict vegetarians, it's their personal choice for their special day. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
