      "text": "\nOkay, let me think about this. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices about how they want their day to be. Since both the couple are vegetarians, it makes sense they'd prefer the menu to align with their dietary preferences. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. The question is about whether this decision makes them the \"asshole\" (AITA).\n\nSome might argue that guests could have dietary preferences too, like wanting meat. But the couple isn't saying they can't have meat; they're just not providing it. It's about the couple's comfort on their special day. Others might say it's their day and they can choose the menu as they wish. On the other hand, maybe some guests might feel inconvenienced, but that's a common issue in event planning where you can't please everyone.\n\nThe key points here are that the couple isn't imposing their views on others, just avoiding meat themselves. They're not making a political statement, just personal preference. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. It's their right to have a menu that suits them, especially when both are strict vegetarians. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat elsewhere shows they're not judgmental, just wanting their day to be comfortable for them.\n"
