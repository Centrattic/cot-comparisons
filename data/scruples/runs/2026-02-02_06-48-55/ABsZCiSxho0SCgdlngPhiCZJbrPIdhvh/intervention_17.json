      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for having a reception with no meat options.\n\nFirst, I should consider the couple's rights. A wedding is a personal event, and the couple is allowed to make choices based on their preferences. Since they're the ones hosting, they can decide the menu. But then, what about guests who want to eat meat? Should they have to accommodate that?\n\nBut wait, the couple isn't saying that guests can't eat meat; they're just choosing to have a vegetarian menu. If there are guests who can't eat vegetarian, maybe the couple should offer some options. However, the question says the reception has no meat options. So maybe they're not providing any meat, which could be an issue for some guests.\n\nBut the couple is strict vegetarians. They might not want to compromise their values. On the other hand, is it reasonable to expect that a wedding might need to consider guests' dietary needs? Like, maybe some guests have allergies, dietary restrictions, or just prefer meat. If the couple is only vegetarian, they might not consider that others might not want to eat vegetarian.\n\nBut the couple mentions they don't have a problem with others eating meat in general. So they're okay with it in other contexts but not their wedding. But why is their wedding any different? Maybe they just want their day to reflect their lifestyle and preferences. That's understandable.\n\nHowever, is it fair to make all guests eat vegetarian? Some people might have strong preferences or dietary needs that require meat. If the couple doesn't offer any meat options, those guests might feel excluded or uncomfortable. But the couple might argue that they're not forcing guests to eat the food; they can bring their own or just not eat if they're not hungry. But that's not practical.\n\nI think the key points here are the couple's right to choose their menu and the guests' expectations. Weddings are often about the couple's preferences, so if they want a vegetarian menu, that's their choice. However, maybe they should consider providing some non-vegetarian options to accommodate guests, but the question states there are no meat options. So they're not doing that. But the couple is strict vegetarians, so maybe they can't compromise. \n\nIn some cases, people might think that not offering meat is inconsiderate, but others might say that it's their wedding day and they have the right to make those choices. So I'm a bit torn. The couple is in a personal event, but they might be ignoring some guests' preferences. But since they're strict vegetarians, maybe it's justified. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's their wedding and they can choose the menu as they see fit. Guests are expected to accommodate the couple's choices, and the couple is being upfront about their vegetarianism. They didn't force guests to eat, just provided their preferred menu. So they're not in the wrong."
