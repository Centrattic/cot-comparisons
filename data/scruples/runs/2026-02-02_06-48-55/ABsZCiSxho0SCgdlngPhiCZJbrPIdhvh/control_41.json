      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding, even though they don't mind others eating meat. They're worried about the smell or look of it being gross. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences. They mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about judging guests. The key here is that their wedding is their event, and they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. \n\nHowever, some might argue that guests who are not vegetarian might not have options. But the couple is providing vegetarian meals, which are suitable for vegetarians, but not for non-vegetarians. But wait, vegetarian meals are still food that non-vegetarians can eat. So maybe that's not an issue. \n\nAnother angle: weddings are personal events, and the couple has the autonomy to decide the menu. They\u2019re not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they\u2019re just not serving meat. It's their choice as the hosts. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe some guests might have allergies or require meat for cultural reasons. But the couple can offer alternative options like vegan dishes if needed, but the question is about vegetarian, not vegan. Also, the couple is not making guests eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose the menu for their event. They\u2019re not excluding guests from eating meat, just not serving it. As long as they provide enough food for all guests, vegetarian or not, it's their choice. People can choose to eat the vegetarian options provided.\n"
