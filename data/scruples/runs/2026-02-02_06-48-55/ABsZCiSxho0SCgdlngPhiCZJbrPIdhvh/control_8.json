      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat generally, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat served. The question is if they're at fault for not having meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. They're not forcing anyone else to be vegetarian, just ensuring their own event aligns with their values. Weddings are personal events where the hosts can set the menu as they wish. However, there might be guests who are not vegetarian and might feel inconvenienced. But the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they\u2019re just not offering meat. However, maybe some guests might have dietary restrictions that require meat, or they might prefer it for cultural reasons. But the couple is clear that they're not against others eating meat in general, just on their wedding day they want to avoid it.\n\nI should also think about whether it's reasonable to expect a vegetarian-only menu. If the couple is providing food that's suitable for their preferences and the guests can choose to eat what's offered or bring their own, then it's their right. However, maybe there's a cultural expectation in some regions where meat is a standard part of a wedding reception, but that's more about cultural norms rather than right or wrong. The couple is making a personal choice, which they have the right to do. They\u2019re not discriminating, just expressing their own preferences. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong. They have the autonomy to decide their wedding menu.\n"
