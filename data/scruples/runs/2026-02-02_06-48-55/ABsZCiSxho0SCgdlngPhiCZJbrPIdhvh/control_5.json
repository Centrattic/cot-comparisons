      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is a valid choice. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make decisions based on their preferences. Since they're both vegetarian, it's their right to choose the menu. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not offering meat. The key point is whether they're being unreasonable by not providing meat options.\n\nSome might argue that guests could have different dietary needs or preferences. But the couple isn't excluding anyone; they're just aligning the reception with their own values. Plus, they mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so they're respectful in general. \n\nAnother angle is the cost or availability. Maybe some guests would prefer meat, but the couple has the right to prioritize their comfort on their special day. It's also common nowadays for weddings to have vegetarian options, and sometimes even fully vegetarian menus, especially if the couple has dietary preferences. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or traditional expectations that might make this a problem, but unless specified, the scenario doesn't mention such factors. The couple is making a personal choice that affects their own event, so it's likely they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
