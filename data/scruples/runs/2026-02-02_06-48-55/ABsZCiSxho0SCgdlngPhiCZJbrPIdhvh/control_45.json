      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding meal. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but find the smell or look unpleasant. They don't comment on others eating around them but want their wedding day to be free of meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal norms. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually makes choices based on their preferences. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and it's becoming more accepted. However, there might be guests who are not vegetarian and might not have a non-meat option. But the couple is clear that they're strict vegetarians and have no issues with others eating meat, just that they don't want it on their wedding day. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable to accommodate guests. Maybe some guests might be offended if there's no meat, but the couple's comfort on their wedding day is also important. If they provide a vegetarian menu that's appealing and don't make a big deal about it, maybe it's okay. Also, sometimes people have dietary restrictions beyond vegetarianism, like gluten-free or allergies, but the question here is specifically about meat.\n\nAnother angle: the couple isn't forcing others to be vegetarian, just the event. It's their day, so they should have the right to choose. But maybe some guests might not have a suitable meal. However, the couple isn't saying there are no options, just that all the options are vegetarian. If the menu is well-planned and varied, it's a valid choice. \n\nIn terms of social norms, I think it's becoming more common to have vegetarian or vegan weddings. The key factors are whether they communicated the menu choice to guests in advance and if the vegetarian options are sufficient. If they did that, then they're not in the wrong. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
