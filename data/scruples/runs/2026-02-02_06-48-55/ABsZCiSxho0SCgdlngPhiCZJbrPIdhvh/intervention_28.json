      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The situation is that both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, so they want their wedding reception to be meat-free. They say they don't judge others for eating meat but just don't want it at their event.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the main points. The couple is vegetarian and prefers not to have meat served. They are not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own wedding menu. The question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nWell, weddings are personal events where the couple can set the rules. If they're okay with paying for a vegetarian menu and the guests understand, then it's their choice. However, some might argue that not offering meat could inconvenience non-vegetarian guests. But the couple mentions they don't mind the cost and that they don't comment on others eating meat normally. So it's about their comfort on their wedding day.\n\nI think the key here is autonomy. The couple has the right to make their own choices for their event. Unless they are in a specific culture where meat is a norm and not providing it might be offensive, but the post doesn't mention that. Also, they are not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. So, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
