      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want the smell or look of meat on their wedding day. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but want their own event to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the couple to make decisions about their own wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually have the final say on the menu. The fact that they are strict vegetarians adds context. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own event's menu to align with their preferences and comfort.\n\nNext, think about common practices. It's not uncommon for people to have themed or specific dietary menus based on their preferences or beliefs. Many weddings go meat-free for various reasons, including environmental, ethical, or health reasons. Guests can bring their own food if they're uncomfortable, but the couple has the right to set the tone for their event.\n\nHowever, some might argue that not offering meat could inconvenience non-vegetarian guests. But the key here is that the couple is not banning meat for others generally, just their own event. They\u2019re not making a judgment, just creating a space that suits them. It's similar to someone choosing a vegan wedding or a halal menu; it's their choice.\n\nAlso, the couple is clear that they don't comment on others eating meat elsewhere. Their request is specific to their wedding day. So, they aren't imposing their views on others in general, just during their celebration. This distinction is important because it's about their personal comfort on a significant day.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to make their wedding reflect their values and preferences. The answer should be B.\n"
