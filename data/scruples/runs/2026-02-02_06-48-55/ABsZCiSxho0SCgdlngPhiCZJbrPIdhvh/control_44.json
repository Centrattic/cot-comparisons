      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They mention they don't have issues with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they prefer no meat.\n\nSo, first, the main points here are about personal choice and respecting others' preferences. The couple is making a decision based on their own dietary preferences and comfort. They\u2019re not forcing anyone else to be vegetarian, just their wedding. Now, weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually have the final say on the menu. However, some people might argue that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences, like non-vegetarians who want meat, or maybe guests with allergies or other restrictions. But the scenario says the couple is offering vegetarian meals, which are suitable for vegetarians, but not for those who eat meat. \n\nWait, but if the wedding is vegetarian, then meat-eaters would have to eat vegetarian. But the couple isn't providing meat, so they can't have meat. The question is whether that's inconsiderate. Some might say that if you're hosting a large event, you should accommodate as many guests as possible. But others might say it's their day and they have the right to choose. Also, the couple isn't saying they won't serve meat, they're choosing not to. It's their decision unless they have guests with specific dietary needs they're aware of. But the scenario doesn't mention any such guests. \n\nAnother angle: the couple is strict vegetarians, so their personal values are important. They\u2019re not imposing on others in their daily lives, just on their special day. So maybe it's reasonable. However, they should make sure that vegetarian options are varied and appealing to all guests. But the question is about the presence of meat, not the quality of vegetarian food. \n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings often have a variety of options, but it's not a rule. If the couple is clear from the beginning (like in the invitation or menu choices), guests can adjust. But if they don't communicate, some guests might be surprised. However, the scenario doesn't mention communication issues. \n\nSo, the key factors are the couple's right to choose their wedding menu based on their lifestyle, and the potential impact on guests who prefer meat. Since the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, but just not offering meat, it's a choice they're making for their own event. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
