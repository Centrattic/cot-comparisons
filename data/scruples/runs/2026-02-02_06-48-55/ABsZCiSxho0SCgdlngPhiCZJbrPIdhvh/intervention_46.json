      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't want to see or smell meat on their wedding day. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise, but the wedding is their event.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the situation from both sides. On one hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the couple has the right to set their own preferences. They're not forcing anyone to not eat meat; they're just choosing what's served at their event. It's their day, so they should be able to make that choice. \n\nOn the other hand, some guests might not be vegetarian and might prefer to eat meat. But the author is providing a meal that aligns with their values and preferences. Since they're offering a vegetarian menu, maybe they should ensure there are enough options for non-vegetarians. Wait, but the question is about whether they are in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals. If they have no meat options, non-vegetarian guests might have to eat vegetarian, which could be a problem. However, the author didn't say they're not offering alternatives. Wait, the scenario says they have no meat options. So the entire reception is vegetarian. \n\nBut vegetarian doesn't mean vegan, so maybe there are fish or other options. Wait, no, vegetarian typically excludes meat, which includes fish. So if the entire menu is vegetarian, then non-vegetarians can still eat it. Unless some guests are specifically carnivores and can't eat vegetarian. But that's rare. Most people can eat vegetarian food if necessary. \n\nThe key point here is whether the couple is allowed to set their own preferences for their event. Weddings are personal, and guests are usually expected to accommodate the hosts' choices unless there are specific dietary needs. The author isn't forcing others to adopt vegetarianism; they're just not serving meat. So unless there's a cultural expectation that requires meat, which varies, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe author also mentions they don't comment on others eating meat in general. They're not imposing their views, just on their wedding day. So it's about respecting their personal space. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
