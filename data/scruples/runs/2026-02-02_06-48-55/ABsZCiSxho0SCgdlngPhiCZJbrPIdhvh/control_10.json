      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the main points here. Weddings are personal events where couples can set their own preferences. The couple is making a choice based on their dietary habits and personal comfort. They aren't forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. The guests can bring their own food if necessary, but usually, guests accommodate the host's preferences unless they have special dietary needs.\n\nBut wait, some guests might have religious or medical reasons for needing meat. However, the couple isn't banning meat entirely; they're just not serving it. Guests are responsible for their own food if they need it, but the couple has the right to set the menu according to their beliefs and comfort. Also, since they don't object to others eating meat in general, just on their day, it's more about their personal comfort on a significant day.\n\nAnother angle: hosting a wedding is a big expense, and the couple is within their rights to choose the menu that fits their lifestyle. Plus, vegetarian options are common these days, so it's not unreasonable. They also mention they never comment on others' eating habits, just prefer their day to be meat-free. So they're not being judgmental, just making a personal choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to make their wedding reflect their values and comfort. Guests who can't handle a vegetarian menu can bring their own food, but it's the couple's day to express their preferences.\n"
