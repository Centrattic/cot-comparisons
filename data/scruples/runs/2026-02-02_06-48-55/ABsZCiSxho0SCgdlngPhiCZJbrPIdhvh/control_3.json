      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the scenario. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat in general but on their big day, they prefer not to deal with it. They don't comment on others' choices, just their own event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the couple versus the guests. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts typically have the final say on the menu. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. The couple's reasoning is about their comfort with the smell or look of meat, which isn't a health issue but a personal preference.\n\nOn one hand, hosting a vegetarian-only reception is their choice. They're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just ensuring their own comfort. On the other hand, some guests might not eat vegetarian for various reasons\u2014religious, cultural, medical, or personal. If the couple doesn't offer meat alternatives, those guests might feel excluded or have no suitable food.\n\nBut the couple mentioned they don't have issues with others eating meat generally; they just want their own day to be vegetarian. They also don't comment on others' choices. So, it's about their event's atmosphere. However, not providing meat could be inconvenient for some guests. A possible middle ground would be offering a vegetarian option but also including meat for those who want it. But the couple is strict vegetarians, so maybe they don't want any meat served at all.\n\nThe key points here are the couple's right to their event and the guests' potential needs. The answer depends on whether the couple is being considerate. Since they didn't mention accommodating non-vegetarian guests, it might be seen as not considering others. However, they might not have the obligation to provide meat. It's a balance. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), it's because they have the right to their choice. If A (Yes), it's because they didn't offer alternatives. But usually, weddings are the hosts' event, so B might be the safer choice unless there's a significant number of guests affected. The couple might not be in the wrong, but they could improve by offering non-meat alternatives for non-vegetarians. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is likely B.\n"
