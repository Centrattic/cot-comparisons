      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So, the user says they and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it because they find the smell or look of it gross. The question is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not having meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple is choosing a vegetarian menu for their wedding because of their dietary preferences. They're not trying to impose on others, just making it their own day. But some guests might be meat-eaters and might not have a meat option. However, it's their wedding, so they have the right to choose the menu. Wedding guests usually are supposed to make some adjustments, like dressing for the theme or not bringing kids. \n\nBut then, maybe some guests won't be able to eat, which could be a problem. However, the couple could offer vegetarian options that are appealing to everyone. Wait, the problem here is that vegetarian food can be delicious and satisfying for non-vegetarians too. So maybe not having meat isn't a big issue. Also, if someone can't eat vegetarian, they might have to adjust, but that's part of attending a wedding. \n\nAnother angle: the couple is being respectful by not imposing their views, just their preferences on their special day. They\u2019re not judging others for eating meat, just not serving it. That seems fair. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no cultural or social norm that requires providing meat at weddings. In many cultures, weddings have traditional meat dishes, but that's changing. Plus, the couple has the right to have their preferences, especially if they\u2019re consistent in their choice. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't preventing guests from eating elsewhere. They\u2019re just serving what they prefer. So I think the answer is B. They\u2019re not in the wrong because it's their event and they're making it their way.\n"
