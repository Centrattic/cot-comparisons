      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat served.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Vegetarian options are becoming more common, but making the entire reception vegetarian might be a point of contention. \n\nThe key points are that they are strict vegetarians, they don't impose their views on others, but they want their own day to reflect their values. However, guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences they might not be able to accommodate if there's no meat. But the couple has the right to choose their own menu. \n\nSome might argue that guests should be considered, but the couple has the right to their own preferences. Others might say that not offering meat could inconvenience some guests. But in the scenario, the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. It's their event, so their choice should be respected. \n\nThe question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their choice is reasonable. Since they are making their preferences clear and it's their own event, it's likely they aren't in the wrong. So I would lean towards B (No). But maybe there's a counterpoint. For example, if someone has a medical need for meat, but that's a stretch. The couple isn't banning meat, just not serving it. So probably B is correct.\n"
