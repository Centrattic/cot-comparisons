      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but they don't want that on their wedding day.\n\nSo the question is, are they in the wrong (A) or not (B)? The user initially thought the author was wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually makes the decisions for their big day. However, there might be guests who aren't vegetarian. But the couple is making a choice that aligns with their values and preferences. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian; they're just choosing their own meal for the event. \n\nBut some might argue that they should offer meat options for guests who prefer it. However, the couple has the right to set the theme based on their lifestyle. Maybe they can mention it in the invitations so guests are aware. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for not having meat options. \n\nI think the core issue is about personal choice versus accommodating guests. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to decide the menu. They aren't preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere, just not serving it at their event. Also, they are vegetarians, so their choice is consistent with their beliefs. So the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
