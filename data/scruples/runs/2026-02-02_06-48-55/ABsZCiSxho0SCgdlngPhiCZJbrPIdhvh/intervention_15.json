      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross, but they don't mind others eating meat in general. They never say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple is vegetarian and wants their wedding to reflect their dietary preferences. They aren't forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own event's menu. Weddings are personal, and guests usually expect the hosts to make decisions based on their preferences. \n\nHowever, some might argue that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the question is, is the author in the wrong? The story says they don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, just that they find it gross. So they're not being judgmental, just setting boundaries for their own event.\n\nIn such cases, the hosts typically have the right to decide the menu. Unless there are guests with allergies or specific dietary restrictions that need accommodation (which isn't mentioned here), the couple can choose a vegetarian menu. The key is that the wedding is their special day, and they have the right to make choices that make them comfortable. \n\nThe person's reasoning might be that hosting a vegetarian-only menu could exclude some guests, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the couple isn't imposing their views on others but choosing their own celebration, they are not in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
