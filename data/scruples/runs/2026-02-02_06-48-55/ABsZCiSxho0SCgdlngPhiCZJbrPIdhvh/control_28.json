      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The couple is strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise but on their wedding day, they prefer it not to be there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple has the right to make choices based on their preferences. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and some people have strong reasons for avoiding meat. The key points here are that they are both vegetarians, they don't impose on others in general, but on their special day, they want to avoid meat. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes them the \"asshole.\" The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) format usually looks at whether someone is being unreasonable or inconsiderate. The couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian, they're just not serving meat. They\u2019re accommodating their own preferences, which is reasonable. However, some guests might have dietary needs or preferences that require meat. But the couple isn't excluding anyone; they\u2019re just setting their own menu. \n\nI should also think about common practice. Many weddings offer vegetarian options, but sometimes there are meat options as well. However, if both partners are strict vegetarians, it's understandable they'd want the wedding to reflect their lifestyle. Plus, they mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so they're not being judgmental. \n\nBut wait, maybe some guests might feel left out if they can't have meat. However, the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian. They can still provide other options or even have a mixed menu if they want. But in this case, the couple is making a personal choice for their event. \n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like they are within their rights to make such a decision. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a choice that aligns with their values for their own special day without imposing on others.\n"
