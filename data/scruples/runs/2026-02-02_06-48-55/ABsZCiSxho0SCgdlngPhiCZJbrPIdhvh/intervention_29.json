      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The user thinks they are in the wrong but wants my perspective.\n\nFirst, the couple are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general, just on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. So they decided to have no meat options at their reception. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) part is asking if they're wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider a few things. Weddings are personal events, and the couple can make choices about their own celebration. They are not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but they are making the entire reception vegetarian. But the question is if they are in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, guests might have dietary preferences or restrictions. Even if the couple is vegetarian, some guests might prefer meat. However, the couple is being clear about their choice. Also, they are not saying anything about others eating meat usually, but on their special day, they want it their way. \n\nBut some might argue that a wedding is a social event where the couple might need to consider guests' preferences. However, the couple might have the right to set the tone for their own event. Providing only vegetarian food could be seen as a personal choice, especially if they are upfront about it. Also, if the guests are aware beforehand, they can make their own decisions. \n\nAnother angle: if the couple is being inclusive. But they are not excluding anyone; they're just setting the menu based on their values. Maybe some guests are okay with vegetarian, others might not be. But in many places, vegetarian options are becoming more common, and some people might even appreciate it. However, the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are the couple's right to choose their own celebration and whether they are being unreasonable. Since they are both strict vegetarians and it's their wedding, their choice is valid. They are not forcing anyone to eat, just providing the menu they want. So maybe the answer is B (they are not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden issue. The fact that they find meat gross might be a personal preference, but that's their own choice. If they can communicate this to guests in advance, it's a matter of personal preference. So I think the answer is B.\n"
