      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So the situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat options. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA) for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple typically makes decisions based on their preferences. Since both are strict vegetarians, it's their right to choose the menu that aligns with their dietary choices and comfort. They're not imposing their views on others; they're just setting the event's menu for their own comfort.\n\nHowever, some might argue that guests with different dietary needs or preferences should be accommodated. But the user mentions that they are open to others eating meat in general and don't comment on it. They're just asking for their own space to have a vegetarian meal. In that case, it's about their personal space and day, so they should have the autonomy.\n\nI should also think about common practices. Many weddings have specific menus, sometimes vegan or vegetarian, and guests are usually informed in advance. The couple can provide vegetarian options, which they are doing. If guests want meat, they might need to bring their own or adjust, but that's part of attending events with specific themes. The couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just hosting their event as per their beliefs.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to host their wedding according to their preferences, especially when they've made it clear and guests can adjust accordingly.\n"
