      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple is strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross, but they don't say anything when others eat meat. On their wedding day, they don't want meat served.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether this is acceptable. The person is thinking they might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, they are in the wrong) or B (no, they are not).\n\nFirst, I should consider the couple's right to make choices for their own event. Weddings are personal events, and the hosts usually have the final say on the menu. They're making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat in general but want their own day to be meat-free seems reasonable. They\u2019re not forcing anyone else to eat vegetarian, just choosing their own celebration's menu.\n\nOn the other hand, some guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. The couple should probably offer alternatives, but the scenario says there are no meat options. However, the couple is vegetarian, so maybe they expect the menu to reflect that. The key point is that they are not imposing their choice on others but setting their own preferences for their event. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). It's their event, and they have the right to choose the menu based on their personal beliefs and comfort, especially since they're not eating meat themselves. However, they might need to consider guest accommodations if possible, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about practical solutions.\n"
