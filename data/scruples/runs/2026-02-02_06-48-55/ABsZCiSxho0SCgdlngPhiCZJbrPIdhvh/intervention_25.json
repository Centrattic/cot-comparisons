      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat generally but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is their special day, and they have the right to make choices about their event. They\u2019re not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they\u2019re just not serving meat. The issue some guests might have is if they have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't accommodated. However, the author could offer alternative options like a separate menu for non-vegetarians. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for not serving meat at all.\n\nFrom a personal choice standpoint, it's their event, so they should be able to set the menu based on their preferences. However, some might argue that guests should have options. But the key point is that the author isn't imposing their choice on others; they're just not serving meat. If they provide vegetarian dishes and maybe a few non-veg options for those who need it, that's considerate. But the scenario here is that they have no meat options. \n\nWait, the original statement says the reception has no meat options. So if guests can't get meat, some might be inconvenienced. But is the author wrong for that? It depends on cultural norms and expectations. In some cultures, weddings traditionally have meat, so deviating might cause surprise. But in others, vegetarian weddings are common and accepted. \n\nAlso, the author isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they\u2019re just not serving meat. The guests can bring their own food if they really want meat, but that's not practical. The author could offer other non-meat options for guests who aren't vegetarian but don't want to eat the same dishes. However, the question is whether it's wrong to exclude meat entirely. \n\nConsidering that the author is making a personal choice for their event, and as long as they are accommodating guests with dietary needs (like allergies or specific preferences beyond vegetarianism), they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue would be if guests with strict dietary requirements aren't accommodated, but the scenario here is about vegetarianism. Since the author and partner are vegetarian and want their wedding to reflect that, it's a personal choice. They might need to communicate clearly with guests about the menu in advance, but the act of not serving meat isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose the menu for their event, especially when it's based on their personal preferences and dietary choices. However, they should ensure that all guests have suitable alternatives if they can't eat vegetarian food for other reasons, but that's not the case mentioned here. The question is specifically about not serving meat, which is a valid choice.\n"
