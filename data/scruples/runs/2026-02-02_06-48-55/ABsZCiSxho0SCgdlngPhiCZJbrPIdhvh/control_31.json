      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who only serves vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The scenario says both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually sets the tone based on their preferences. Since both are vegetarians, choosing a vegetarian menu reflects their lifestyle. There's no obligation to accommodate non-vegetarian guests unless there are specific dietary restrictions they know about. Vegetarian options are becoming more common, so maybe it's not an issue.\n\nBut some might argue that guests might expect a variety, including meat. However, the couple isn't hiding their vegetarianism. They might have communicated this to guests beforehand. Also, many people can adapt for a special occasion. If the couple is clear and provides good vegetarian options, it's their choice. They aren't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. So the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
