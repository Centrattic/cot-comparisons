      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to avoid it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple is vegetarian and wants their wedding to reflect their dietary choices. They aren't forcing others to eat vegetarian, but the reception will have no meat options. The question is whether this makes them the asshole.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is usually about respecting others' choices and not imposing personal preferences unless there's a valid reason. Here, the couple is making a choice for their own event. Weddings are personal, and couples often make specific decisions about food, themes, etc., based on their preferences. Since they're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, but rather choosing their own menu, it's their right as hosts. Guests can bring their own food if they really can't handle it, but that's extreme. However, most guests would likely understand or bring a side dish if needed.\n\nBut some might argue that not offering meat could inconvenience guests who prefer or require it. However, in many places, vegetarian weddings are becoming more common, and many guests are accommodating. The hosts are clear about their choice, so guests can plan accordingly. The couple isn't being hostile; they're just following their values. \n\nThe person who thinks the author is in the wrong might believe that a wedding should cater to all guests, but traditionally, weddings are about the couple's preferences. The hosts have the right to set the menu as they see fit. Unless there's a cultural expectation to include meat that's being ignored, which isn't mentioned here, the couple isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong). Their choice is their own, and they're not imposing on others beyond their own event's menu.\n"
