      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but they want their wedding reception to be vegetarian-only. The question is if they are in the wrong (AITA) for not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is strict vegetarians, which is their personal choice. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just opting for their own event to reflect their preferences. They are not making a moral judgment against others who eat meat; they just prefer not to be around it on their special day.\n\nWeddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and make choices based on their preferences. Serving vegetarian meals only would be consistent with their lifestyle. It's their right to choose the menu for their reception, especially since they can accommodate guests with vegetarian options. However, they should also consider guests who might have dietary restrictions that aren't vegetarian, like allergies or other preferences. But the question doesn't mention that they're excluding other dietary needs, just meat.\n\nThe important aspect is that they're not imposing their beliefs on others but simply creating a space that aligns with their own values for their day. They're not preventing guests from bringing their own food if that's a thing, but in typical weddings, the menu is set by the couple. It's common for couples to have specific menus, and many guests are okay with that as long as there are alternatives if needed. Since the couple isn't making a judgment on others' choices, just their own event, it seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue if some guests have no option but to eat vegetarian, which might be a problem for non-vegetarians. But the couple hasn't mentioned providing meat alternatives, so if they are only serving vegetarian food, they might need to ensure that there are options for guests who can't eat vegetarian for health reasons. But the question is more about whether they are in the wrong for choosing vegetarian-only, not about accommodating all dietary needs. Since they are strict vegetarians and the event reflects their lifestyle, it's their choice. The fact that they don't comment on others eating meat shows they're not judgmental, so their personal event being vegetarian isn't about enforcing their views on others but about their own comfort.\n\nIn summary, the couple has the right to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences. They aren't forcing others to adopt vegetarianism, just creating an environment that suits them. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
