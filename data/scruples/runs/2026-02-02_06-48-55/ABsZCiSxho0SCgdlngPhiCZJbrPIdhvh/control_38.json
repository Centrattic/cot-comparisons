      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to have meat on their wedding day. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for not serving meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general etiquette around weddings. Weddings are personal events, so the couple usually has the right to make choices that reflect their preferences and values. Since both the author and their partner are vegetarian, choosing a vegetarian menu aligns with their lifestyle. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat but just want their own day to be without it. That seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that guests who aren't vegetarian might not have options. But the couple isn't forcing others to eat their way; they're just not serving meat. It's their choice for their special day. Also, they don't make a big deal about others eating meat in other contexts, just their wedding. That shows they're considerate of others' preferences in general but have a specific request for their own event.\n\nI think the key points here are the right to personal choice in a private event and the fact that they're not imposing their views on others beyond their own event. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
