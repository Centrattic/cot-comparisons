      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general etiquette around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on the details. Since both the author and their partner are vegetarian, it makes sense they'd want their wedding to reflect their dietary preferences. They also mention they don't judge others for eating meat, so it's not about imposing their beliefs on guests but about their own comfort on their special day.\n\nHowever, some guests might have different needs or preferences. Maybe some are non-vegetarian or have dietary restrictions that require meat. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're making a choice for their own event and not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, it's their right. The key point is that they're not excluding anyone but choosing what's served. Most people would understand that a couple can have a vegetarian wedding if that's their preference. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
