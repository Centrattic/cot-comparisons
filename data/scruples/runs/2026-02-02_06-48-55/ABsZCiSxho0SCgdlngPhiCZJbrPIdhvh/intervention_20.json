      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but they want their wedding day to be meat-free. The question is whether they're in the wrong by not offering meat options at their reception.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons they're doing this. They're both vegetarians, so it makes sense that they'd want their own event to align with their dietary preferences. Weddings are personal events, and people often customize them to reflect their values or preferences. However, there might be guests who aren't vegetarian and might expect to have meat options. But the couple isn't imposing their views on others; they're just choosing their own event's menu.\n\nI remember that in some cases, people might feel that not offering meat could exclude certain guests. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food\u2014they're just not serving meat. If guests want to eat something else, maybe they can bring their own or skip the meat. Also, the couple didn't mention making exceptions or causing offense. They are clear that they have no issues with others eating meat, just not on their wedding day.\n\nAnother angle is that weddings are about the couple's preferences. They're spending their money and celebrating their union. It's their right to decide the menu. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their region that requires meat at weddings, which the question doesn't mention, they should be within their rights. However, maybe they should consider offering alternative options for non-vegetarian guests. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not about what they should do.\n\nI think the key points are that the couple has a right to their personal choice, and they're not forcing anyone else to eat vegetarian. They\u2019re also being respectful by not commenting on others' choices. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
