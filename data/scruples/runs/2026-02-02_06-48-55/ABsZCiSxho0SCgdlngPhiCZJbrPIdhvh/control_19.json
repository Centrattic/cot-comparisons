      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when other people eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat options. The question is whether they are at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning behind their decision. They are both vegetarians, so choosing a vegetarian menu aligns with their personal choices and values. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the right to decide the menu based on their preferences. However, they might have guests who are not vegetarians. But the key point here is that the couple is not forcing their guests to eat vegetarian; they are simply serving what they prefer. The guests can choose not to eat if they don't want vegetarian food, but the couple is within their rights to set the menu as they wish.\n\nAnother angle is whether it's considerate. Some might argue that having at least some meat options could accommodate all guests, but others might say that the couple has the right to their choice, especially since they are the ones hosting the event. Since the couple is not imposing their diet on others but is making a choice for their own event, it's more about personal preference rather than being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the couple mentions they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't judgmental. They just want their own event to reflect their lifestyle. This seems reasonable. So the answer would likely be B, No, they are not in the wrong.\n"
