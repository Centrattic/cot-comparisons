      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who plans a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served at their wedding, even though they're okay with others eating meat in general. They find the smell or look of meat gross but don't comment on others. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where couples can make choices based on their preferences. The author isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Since the couple is vegetarian, it makes sense they'd prefer their special day to reflect their lifestyle. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences they can't accommodate, but the author is providing vegetarian options, which they can eat. \n\nBut wait, the author is not offering meat as an option. They're making the entire reception vegetarian. Some might argue that guests who prefer meat have to adjust, but others might say that the couple has the right to host their wedding as they wish. The key point is that they're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If guests can't handle that, they can bring their own food or choose not to attend, but the couple is within their rights to set the menu.\n\nAnother angle: the couple isn't imposing their views on others. They don't comment on others' eating habits, which shows respect. However, the wedding is their event, so it's their choice. The argument for \"not in the wrong\" is stronger here. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
