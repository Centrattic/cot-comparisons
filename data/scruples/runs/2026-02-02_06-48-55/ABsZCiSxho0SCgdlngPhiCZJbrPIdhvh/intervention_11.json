      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nHmm, so the author is saying they don't think the person is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The user is asking for an answer between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since both partners are strict vegetarians, it makes sense they'd want their wedding to reflect their dietary choices. They are not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so they're respecting others' choices in other situations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that guests who prefer meat might not have options. But the couple is providing vegetarian meals, which should be sufficient. It's their day, and they have the right to set the menu according to their beliefs and comfort. Plus, they're not making a judgment about others' choices, just creating a space that's comfortable for them.\n\nI think the key points are autonomy in personal events and the fact that they're not imposing their views on others. The couple is accommodating their own needs without forcing others. So the answer is likely B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
