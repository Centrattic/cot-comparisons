      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me start by reading the scenario again.\n\nThe couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want to deal with it. The question is whether they are at fault for not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I should consider their reasoning. They're making choices for their own wedding, which is a personal event. Weddings are typically where the couple can set the tone and preferences they want. So, choosing vegetarian food because of their dietary preferences and personal discomfort with meat seems reasonable. But maybe some guests might not like that. However, the couple hasn't forced anyone to eat a certain way; they're just choosing the options available at their event.\n\nI should also think about whether they're infringing on others' rights. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to decide the menu. Guests are invited to celebrate with them, not necessarily to have their own preferences catered to. Unless the guest has a medical or religious necessity that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, it's the couple's choice.\n\nAnother angle is consideration. Maybe some guests might not eat vegetarian, but the couple is willing to serve vegetarian meals. However, the couple could offer alternatives, but they don't have to. The question is about whether they are in the wrong. If they're not being inconsiderate beyond their own preferences, maybe they're not wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect. If in the culture or tradition of the wedding, meat is expected, but the scenario doesn't mention that. Also, the couple is clear that they are strict vegetarians, so it's a personal choice. \n\nI think the key points are: it's their event, they have the right to set the menu based on their preferences, and they're not forcing others to eat what they don't want. So, the answer would be that they're not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
