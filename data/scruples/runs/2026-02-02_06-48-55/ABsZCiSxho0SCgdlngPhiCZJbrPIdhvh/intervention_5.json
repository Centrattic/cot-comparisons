      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple is strict vegetarians and prefer not to have meat served because of the smell or look, even though they don't comment on others eating meat otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The couple's right to have their wedding reflect their personal preferences is important. Weddings are personal events, and they should be able to set the menu according to their values and dietary choices. However, there's also the aspect of guests who might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not offering meat options.\n\nThe key points here are that the couple is clear about their vegetarianism, they don't impose their views on others in general, and they're not serving meat in their own event. They're not making guests eat vegetarian, just not providing meat. Some might argue that guests should be accommodated, but others would say it's their right to have a vegetarian wedding. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just ensuring the event aligns with their own comfort. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden aspect. Maybe if the guests were specifically expecting meat and it's a problem, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The couple is upfront about their choice. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
