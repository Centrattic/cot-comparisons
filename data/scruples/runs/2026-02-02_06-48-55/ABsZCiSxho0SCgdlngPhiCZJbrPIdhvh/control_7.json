      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for not providing meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their reasoning. They're both vegetarians, so it's their choice to have a vegetarian menu. Weddings are personal events, and guests usually make accommodations. However, some might argue that not offering meat could inconvenience non-vegetarian guests. But the key points here are that the couple is not judging others, just choosing their own preferences for their day. They\u2019re not making it a rule for others, just their event. \n\nTraditionally, weddings might have a variety, but this is changing as more people have dietary preferences. It's their right to choose their menu. Unless there's a cultural expectation that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, they're within their rights. The answer would likely be that they\u2019re not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
