      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general, but on their wedding day, they don't want to deal with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of guests. Some guests might be meat-eaters and might not have a vegetarian option. But the author's reasoning is that they're choosing their own event's menu. Weddings are personal events, so the hosts have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, maybe there's an expectation that there should be options for everyone. But the author is providing vegetarian food, which is what they eat. Since they're both vegetarian, maybe it's reasonable. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat in general, so it's not about imposing on others, but their own day.\n\nAnother angle is inclusivity. But the wedding is their day, and they have the right to make choices that make them comfortable. Plus, many people can eat vegetarian, and those who can't might bring their own food or have other options. The key is that the author isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat. So, they're not wrong because it's their event and they have a valid reason. So answer B.\n"
