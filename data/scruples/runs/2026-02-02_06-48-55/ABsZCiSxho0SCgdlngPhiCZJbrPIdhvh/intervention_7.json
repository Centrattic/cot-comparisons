      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, so they don't want meat at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat in general but just want their own special day to be vegetarian. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. If both partners are vegetarian and comfortable with that choice, they have the right to set the menu according to their values. However, some guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the author mentions that they're okay with others eating meat in general and don't say anything when others do so. So the issue here is about their own event.\n\nNext, think about the guests. Would not having meat options inconvenience them? Maybe some guests are non-vegetarian or have specific dietary restrictions. But weddings typically have a variety of food to accommodate different tastes, but it's also a personal choice of the couple. If they're providing vegetarian food, maybe they can include some non-meat options like fish or other proteins that aren't meat but still non-vegan. But the author specifically says no meat options, which might exclude some guests.\n\nHowever, the couple has the right to their own preferences for their event. It's their day, and they can choose the menu. The fact that they're being clear about it and not forcing anyone to eat meat is important. Guests can bring their own food if necessary, though that's not ideal. But the author isn't trying to impose their views on others, just making their own event reflect their lifestyle.\n\nAnother angle: cultural or religious considerations. If the wedding has certain traditions that involve meat, that could be a point, but the question doesn't mention that. The key points are their personal comfort and being strict vegetarians. They aren't making a judgment but making a personal choice for their event.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat, then it's their choice. However, the potential issue is if guests with specific needs aren't accommodated. But the author didn't mention that they aren't offering alternatives beyond vegetarian. If they are providing enough options, then it's their right. If they're only vegetarian and no other options, that's different. But the question states \"no meat options,\" which implies vegetarian, but maybe they have other options. The original post says \"vegetarian meals,\" which usually includes non-meat proteins like eggs, dairy, etc., which are acceptable for most vegetarians.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They are making a personal choice for their event based on their lifestyle. It's similar to a vegan wedding or a halal wedding, where the menu reflects the couple's beliefs. The answer would be B, No.\n"
