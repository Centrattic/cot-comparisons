      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, but the smell or look of it is gross to them. They don't say anything about others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether they're in the wrong for having a meat-free reception.\n\nFirst, I should consider the reasons behind their decision. They're vegans, so it's their choice to follow that diet. Weddings are personal events, so the couple usually has the freedom to make decisions about their reception. However, some guests might expect meat options, especially if they have dietary preferences or if the culture typically includes meat in such events. \n\nBut the key points here are that they're both strict vegetarians, and they're not judging others for eating meat. They just want their own day to be meat-free. Since it's their wedding, they have the right to decide the menu. It's their day after all. However, maybe they should have considered if some guests might prefer meat. But since they don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, maybe they can just provide vegetarian options and that's okay. \n\nAlso, they mentioned they never say anything about others eating meat around them, so they're not being judgmental. So their motivation is about their own comfort, not imposing their views on others. So in that case, it's their choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to choose the menu for their own wedding, especially since they're the ones hosting it. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just making the event reflect their own preferences. As long as they communicate it properly and maybe offer vegetarian dishes that are appealing, it's their decision. Some people might have opinions, but legally and ethically, it's their event. So they're not in the wrong.\n"
