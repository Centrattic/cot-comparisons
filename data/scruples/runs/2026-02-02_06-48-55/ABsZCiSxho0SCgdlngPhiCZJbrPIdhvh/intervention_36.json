      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat unpleasant, so they don't want meat served at their wedding. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their special day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on the details. The fact that both partners are strict vegetarians and have a genuine aversion to meat's presence might be a valid reason. They also mention not saying anything about others eating meat, just wanting their own day to be as they prefer.\n\nHowever, potential issues could be guests expecting meat options, especially if they have dietary preferences or restrictions. But the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own menu. Guests can bring their own food if needed, though that's not common. The question is whether it's reasonable for the couple to prioritize their preferences here.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the key is intent and impact. The couple's intent is personal comfort, and the impact is on guests who might not have meat options. But weddings are the couple's event, and they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. Many people have dietary restrictions, and catering to vegetarians is common. So, not serving meat isn't inherently wrong, especially when the couple is transparent about it. Guests should plan accordingly or communicate their needs. Since the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, the answer would likely be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
