      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal rights and preferences. People have the right to make choices about their own event, especially their wedding. If they're vegetarian and have a valid reason for not wanting meat, that's their choice. Others might bring up guests who aren't vegetarian, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat the food. They can offer vegetarian options, but it's their day to celebrate their way. Maybe some guests might be inconvenienced, but it's a personal choice. Also, the couple isn't making a statement about others' dietary choices, just their own. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
