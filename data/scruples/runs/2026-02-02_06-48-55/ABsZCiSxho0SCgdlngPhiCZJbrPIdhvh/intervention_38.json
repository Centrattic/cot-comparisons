      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross, even though they don't comment on others eating it. The question is whether they should serve only vegetarian options at their reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities of the couple versus their guests. Weddings are personal events, so the couple has the right to make choices based on their preferences. However, they also have a duty to consider their guests. \n\nNow, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences for meat. If the couple is strict vegetarians, maybe they don't eat meat themselves, but not everyone invited might be vegetarian. It's possible that some guests could be offended or feel excluded if there's no meat option. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own menu. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple has every right to celebrate their wedding according to their beliefs and comfort. They mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't being judgmental. They're just not wanting to have meat on their special day. \n\nI should also think about common practices. Many weddings have both vegetarian and meat options. But maybe the couple's reasoning is that they want a consistent menu for their own experience. However, not offering meat could be seen as inconsiderate to guests who prefer it. \n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but the assistant's job is to decide. So, maybe the key here is the balance between personal choice and guest accommodation. While the couple can choose their menu, not providing any meat might be seen as not considering their guests' preferences. However, if they do offer vegetarian meals but don't have meat, that's different. The question here is whether the reception has no meat options. If the entire menu is vegetarian, some guests might feel it's imposing their dietary choice on everyone. But if the couple is being respectful and not making a big deal about it, maybe it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's their right to have a vegetarian wedding if that's their preference. But the potential issue is with guests who might not be prepared for a vegetarian menu. The couple could offer a variety of vegetarian dishes to cater to different tastes, but if they are strict vegetarians, they might not want any meat at all. \n\nI need to check if there's a standard expectation. Traditionally, weddings have a mix of options. If you don't serve meat, you might need to provide good alternatives. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The decision hinges on whether the couple is respecting their guests' preferences while honoring their own. \n\nThe couple's reasoning is about their own comfort, not forcing others to eat vegetarian. If they're not making a point about others' choices, maybe it's acceptable. But still, not offering meat could lead to some guests being uncomfortable. However, the couple is entitled to their own preferences. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's their wedding and they can choose their menu. But maybe the user is thinking that it's wrong because they're not providing meat. However, if the couple is open to others eating meat elsewhere but just don't want it at their wedding, that's a personal choice. The key is that they are not making others eat vegetarian, just not serving it. \n\nAnother angle: the couple is responsible for their own dietary needs, but they should also consider the guests. If they don't have meat, they should have other options. Since they are strict vegetarians, they probably have a well-planned menu. So maybe it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n"
