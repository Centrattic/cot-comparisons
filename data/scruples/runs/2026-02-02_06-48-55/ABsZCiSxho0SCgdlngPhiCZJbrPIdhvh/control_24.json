      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The question is whether they're at fault for not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on how they want to plan it. Since both partners are vegetarian and they find the smell or look of meat unpleasant, it's reasonable for them to make this choice. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, just prefer their own event to be vegetarian. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be about accommodating guests who might prefer meat. However, the couple isn't banning meat outright but choosing their own menu. Guests can bring their own food if needed, but typically, weddings cater to the couple's preferences first. Also, many people have dietary restrictions or preferences, and it's common to offer vegetarian options even if there's a meat option. But in this case, the couple is making it vegetarian-only. \n\nI should check if there's any social norm or etiquette that dictates that weddings must have meat. From what I know, there's no such rule. In fact, many weddings have vegan or vegetarian only menus for various reasons. The key here is that the couple is being consistent with their beliefs and preferences. They\u2019re not imposing on others unless others attend, but they have the right to set their event's menu.\n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are within their rights to plan their wedding as they wish, especially when it aligns with their personal values and comfort levels.\n"
