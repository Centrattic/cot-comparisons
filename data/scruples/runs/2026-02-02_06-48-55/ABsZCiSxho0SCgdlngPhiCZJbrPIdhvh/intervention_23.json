      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian wedding reception. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it.\n\nSo, the question is whether making the entire reception vegetarian is the wrong thing to do. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide.\n\nFirst, I should consider the couple's rights. They are having their wedding, which is a personal event. They have the right to choose the menu based on their dietary preferences and values. Since they are the hosts, it's their decision. Also, they mentioned they don't impose on others, just want their day to reflect their lifestyle. \n\nHowever, some guests might not be vegetarian. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If there are non-vegetarian guests, they can bring their own food or ask for alternatives. Wait, but usually, weddings provide the menu. If they don't have meat, maybe some guests might feel excluded. But again, it's the couple's event. They can set the tone as they wish. Also, maybe they can offer other options like alternative dishes that are vegetarian but still appealing to everyone. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The couple has the autonomy to decide their wedding's menu. As long as they are respectful and provide adequate food for all guests, it's their choice. They aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just ensuring the event aligns with their values. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. They are making a personal choice that affects their own event, not imposing on others outside of that context.\n"
