      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat generally but just want their wedding to be meat-free. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since they're vegetarians and it's their special day, they have the right to choose the menu that aligns with their values and comfort. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not offering meat options.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The couple has the autonomy to decide their wedding's details. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and they have the right to enforce that in their event. On the other hand, guests might expect some variety, but the couple isn't obligating guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If the venue allows, they could inform guests in advance and perhaps offer alternative options if needed, but the core issue is the couple's right to their choice.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences on their wedding day. However, it's good practice to communicate with guests beforehand to manage expectations. But the act of serving only vegetarian food isn't inherently wrong unless it's due to a discriminatory reason, which isn't the case here.\n"
