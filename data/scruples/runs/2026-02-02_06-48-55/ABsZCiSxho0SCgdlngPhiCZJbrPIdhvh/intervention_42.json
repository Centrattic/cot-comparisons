      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to deal with it on their wedding day, so they're not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple is vegetarian and wants their wedding to reflect their dietary preferences. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. The key here is that they're not judging others for eating meat but are making a personal choice for their event. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian, like wanting meat. But the author isn't excluding anyone; they're just not offering meat. Guests can choose other vegetarian dishes. \n\nI should also think about common practices. Many people have themed weddings or specific menus based on their preferences. For example, some might have a seafood-only reception, but that's different. Vegetarian weddings are becoming more common, and it's acceptable as long as it's communicated properly. The author isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat, which they find unpleasant. \n\nAnother angle is whether it's considerate. The couple isn't saying others can't eat meat, just that their event will be vegetarian. It's their day, and they have the right to make that choice. Unless there's a specific religious or cultural expectation that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, it's their decision. \n\nBut could there be a downside? Maybe some guests might not eat vegetarian for other reasons (like allergies, religious reasons, or just personal preference). However, the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food, and typically, guests can adjust or bring a dish if needed. The main responsibility is to accommodate dietary restrictions, but if the couple is aware of specific needs (like a guest with a meat allergy), they should address that. But the general population of guests would be expected to eat what's served unless there's prior knowledge. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is making a personal choice for their wedding day, which is their right. They're not being inconsiderate by not serving meat as long as they communicate it clearly and offer enough vegetarian options. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
