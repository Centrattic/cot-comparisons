      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat normally, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything to others, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat at the reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the couple versus their guests. Weddings are personal events where the hosts can make choices about their event. If they're vegetarian and want their day to align with their values and preferences, that's understandable. However, they should consider if some guests might prefer or require meat options. But the question is about whether the author is wrong.\n\nThe couple isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. The guests can bring their own food if they want, but realistically, most guests would just eat what's provided. So, maybe some guests might be uncomfortable not having meat, but the hosts are within their rights to set the menu according to their own preferences. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the couple could offer a compromise, like having a separate meat option for guests. But the scenario says the reception has no meat options. If they're strict vegetarians, maybe they have strong reasons. However, the guests might feel it's inconsiderate if they can't have meat. But the hosts aren't obligated to cater to every guest's preference. It's their event, so they can make their own choices. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the hosts are being inconsiderate. Since they mention they don't say anything to others about meat but just prefer not to have it on their day, it's their personal choice. Maybe not wrong. But some might argue they should accommodate guests. However, the hosts aren't forcing anyone to eat there, just not providing meat. So the author might not be in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No).\n"
