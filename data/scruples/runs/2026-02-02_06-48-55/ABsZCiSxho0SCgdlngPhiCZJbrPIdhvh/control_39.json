      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So, the scenario is both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want meat served. The question is whether they're in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is strict vegetarians, which is their personal choice. They don't object to others eating meat, just that they find it unpleasant. Their reasoning is that they don't want to deal with the smell or look on their wedding day. The main issue is whether this decision is acceptable or if they're being unreasonable.\n\nI should think about common societal norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on the details. However, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences. But in this case, the couple isn't excluding meat-eaters; they're just not serving meat. Wait, but if the reception has no meat options, does that mean the menu is entirely vegetarian? So, non-vegetarian guests would still have food, but it's vegetarian. That's different from not having vegetarian options. The couple is choosing their own menu based on their preferences.\n\nNow, considering if this is \"in the wrong.\" The phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often involves social expectations. If the couple is making a personal choice that doesn't harm others, are they in the wrong? They are not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. Guests can eat the vegetarian food. However, some guests might prefer meat, but the couple has the right to their own preferences. \n\nBut sometimes, people might think that a wedding should accommodate various dietary needs, including meat. However, the couple isn't excluding anyone's dietary preferences; they are just choosing their own. Also, the couple isn't making a moral judgment but a personal choice for their own event. \n\nAnother angle: if they are strict vegetarians, maybe they want their wedding to reflect their lifestyle. It's their day, so they should be able to decide. Plus, they mention they don't say anything about others eating meat, so they're not being judgmental. The issue is their own comfort on their special day. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, they are not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose the menu for their wedding, and they are not violating any norms by doing so. They are accommodating their own preferences without forcing others to conform.\n"
