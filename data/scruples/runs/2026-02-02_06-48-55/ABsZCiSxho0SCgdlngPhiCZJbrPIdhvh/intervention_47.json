      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't want to deal with meat smells or looks on their wedding day. They mention that they don't comment on others eating meat but want their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where couples can make choices based on their preferences. The author's reasoning is about their own comfort, not forcing others. They\u2019re not stopping guests from eating meat elsewhere, just ensuring their own event aligns with their values. \n\nBut some might argue that not providing meat could exclude non-vegetarian guests. However, the post says there are no meat options, not that they're removing existing ones. The couple is making a personal choice for their day. It's their event, so they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. Guests can bring their own food if needed, but that's unlikely. Also, many people respect dietary choices, especially if communicated in advance.\n\nThe key points are autonomy and respect. The authors are expressing their values without imposing on others. Unless there's a cultural expectation or a specific guest with a dietary restriction that wasn't considered, it's their right. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
