      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat unpleasant. They don't want to deal with it on their wedding day, even though they don't mind others eating meat otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple's personal dietary preferences are valid. They\u2019re not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own event to reflect their values. Weddings are personal events where couples can make choices based on their preferences. However, some guests might not be vegetarian, so the couple should probably offer alternatives to avoid making non-veg guests uncomfortable. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe writer says they don't have an issue with others eating meat but just want their own day to be free of it. The main ethical consideration here is respecting others' dietary needs. If they're providing vegetarian options, which they are, it's their choice. However, if they don't offer any non-vegetarian options, some guests might be left out. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only menu. \n\nIn most cases, people understand that personal events reflect the hosts' preferences. So as long as they communicate clearly and offer alternatives, it's their right to make that choice. The author isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian food, just not serving meat. So the answer would likely be B, No. However, I should check if there's any cultural or social norm that might make this a problem. In some cultures, weddings are expected to have a variety, but the couple's own preferences should take precedence. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the reasoning, it seems more like the author isn't. So the answer is B.\n"
