      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything about others eating meat around them, but they want their wedding day to be free of meat. The question is whether they're a \"troublemaker\" (AITA) for not having meat options at the reception.\n\nFirst, I should consider their reasons. They're making choices that align with their personal preferences and dietary restrictions. Since they're the ones hosting the wedding, it's their right to choose the menu. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and make decisions that reflect their values and lifestyle.\n\nBut wait, what about the guests? Do they have a right to expect meat options? Well, guests might have their own dietary needs, but the couple isn't excluding meat-eaters in a harmful way. They're not making it impossible for meat-eaters to eat\u2014they're just not serving meat. If someone can't eat vegetarian, they could bring their own food or adjust. However, that's not very common. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not offering meat. \n\nAnother angle: cultural or religious considerations. If the wedding has a specific cultural context where meat is traditional, maybe that's a point. But the scenario doesn't mention that. It's about their personal preferences. \n\nAlso, the couple isn't judging others for eating meat; they just prefer not to have it on their day. They don't comment on others' choices, which shows they're respectful. So their stance is about their own comfort, not imposing on others.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, usually, hosts can choose their menu unless there's a cultural expectation. Weddings are a time for the couple to celebrate their way. Unless the venue has strict rules, they can decide the food. Providing vegetarian options is common, and making it vegetarian-only is a valid choice if they prefer.\n\nSo putting it all together: the couple is acting within their rights. They\u2019re making a personal choice that affects their event, not violating any norms unless there's a specific expectation they're ignoring. Therefore, the answer should be B (they are not in the wrong).\n"
