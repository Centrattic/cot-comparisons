      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me think through this. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is if it's their fault (AITA) for not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to make decisions about their own preferences, including dietary choices. Since they are both vegetarians, choosing a vegetarian menu makes sense for their own comfort and values. The key point is that they're not imposing their choice on others, just setting the tone for their own event. \n\nHowever, some might argue that guests have various dietary needs and preferences. But the author isn't excluding meat-eaters from eating meat elsewhere; they're just not serving it at their specific event. It's about the couple's comfort on their big day. The author also mentions they don't say anything about others eating meat, so it's not about judging guests but personal preference. \n\nIn many cases, people choose all-vegan or all-vegetarian weddings for their own reasons, and it's generally accepted as a personal choice. As long as the guests are informed in advance and given suitable alternatives, it shouldn't be a problem. The author's reasoning seems valid, so I don't think they're in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
