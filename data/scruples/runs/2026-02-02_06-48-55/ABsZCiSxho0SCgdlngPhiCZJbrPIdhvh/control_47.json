      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple is strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if hosting a vegetarian-only wedding is reasonable. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the right to set their own preferences. Since both the couple and their partner are strict vegetarians, it's their choice to have a meat-free event. They also mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about imposing on others' choices but about their own comfort on their special day.\n\nSome people might argue that guests might not have vegetarian options, but the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. However, in some cultures or regions, having meat might be a common expectation, so some guests might feel excluded. But the couple has the right to make their own event preferences. Additionally, the couple isn't making a judgment on others' diets, just stating their own. So, they're not in the wrong because it's their event, and they're being consistent with their own values. The answer should be B.\n"
