      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want the smell or sight of meat on their big day. They don't mind others eating meat in general but prefer their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. The author isn't imposing their views on others; they're just not serving meat. But some guests might want to eat meat, so offering options could be considerate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not providing meat.\n\nI should think about common practices. Many weddings have vegetarian options, but often include meat as well for non-vegetarian guests. However, the author's reasoning is about their own comfort, which is valid. They also mention they don't comment on others' meat consumption, just prefer their day to be meat-free. \n\nCould there be a middle ground? Maybe offering a vegetarian option with a note that meat isn't available, but the author might not want to compromise. Also, guests usually expect some variety, but if the couple is clear about their choice, maybe guests can adjust. \n\nIs it unreasonable to ask guests to adapt for a day? Some might find it inconvenient, but others respect the hosts' wishes. The key here is the author's right to make personal choices versus accommodating all guests. Since the author isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat, it's more about personal preference. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to host a vegetarian wedding, especially since they're not preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere. However, providing a note explaining their choice could help guests understand. But ultimately, it's their event, so their preferences should be respected.\n"
