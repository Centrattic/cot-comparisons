      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, so they don't want meat served. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general, but on their wedding day, they prefer not to deal with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural or social norms around weddings. Weddings are typically personal events where the couple's preferences are prioritized. The guests are invited to celebrate the couple, so the couple usually has the right to make decisions about the event. Vegetarian options are becoming more common, and many people choose to have them for various reasons like dietary restrictions, health, or lifestyle choices.\n\nThe couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing their own menu. They're not making a judgment about others' dietary choices but are focusing on their own comfort. In many places, offering vegetarian meals is standard, and some guests might even appreciate the option. However, some traditional guests might expect meat to be served, but that's changing with time.\n\nThe key points here are that the couple is being respectful of others' choices in general but is making a personal choice for their own event. There's no indication they're shaming others or refusing to accommodate guests with different needs, unless there's a specific mention. The question is whether excluding meat is unreasonable. Since the couple is the one hosting, they have the right to set the menu. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice for their special day without imposing on others' choices.\n"
