      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding day to be vegetarian. The main question is whether it's wrong to have no meat options at the reception.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider arguments for both sides. On the author's side: it's their wedding, a personal event. They have the right to choose how they want to celebrate. Their dietary choices are strict, and they want to avoid meat for their comfort. Offering vegetarian meals is also a kind gesture for guests, though maybe some non-vegetarian guests might not eat it, but it's still a valid choice.\n\nOn the other side: some guests might prefer meat, especially if they're not vegetarian. The couple could offer vegetarian options but also include meat dishes. However, in this case, the couple is choosing to have no meat. But since it's their day, they can make that choice. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not a judgmental stance. They're just avoiding meat for their own comfort on their special day.\n\nI think the key point is that it's their event, and they have the autonomy to decide the menu. Not providing meat isn't forcing others to eat it, but it's their choice. Unless there's a cultural expectation or a specific guest with dietary restrictions that aren't being accommodated, but the question doesn't mention that. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The couple's decision is valid for their personal preferences.\n"
