      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The couple's dietary preferences are strict, and they have a specific reason for not wanting meat served at their wedding. They mention they don't comment on others eating meat, but this is their special day where they want to avoid the sensory aspects. \n\nWeddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and menu according to their preferences. It's common for couples to make dietary choices based on their own beliefs, health, or lifestyle. Since they're not forcing others to be vegetarian, but simply not offering meat, it's about their comfort on the day. \n\nHowever, some might argue that guests with different dietary needs might expect options. But the scenario doesn't mention the couple not accommodating others' dietary restrictions; they're just sticking to their own. They also state they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't imposing their views. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's their right to plan their wedding as they see fit. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their community that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, they aren't violating a standard. They\u2019re making a personal choice for their day. \n\nPotential counterarguments could be about guest preferences, but the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food or having other options. The question is about the wedding they're hosting, so their choice is valid. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to plan their wedding according to their dietary preferences without making others feel excluded unless they specifically choose to exclude. The key points are their own dietary choices and not imposing on others, just avoiding the things they find unpleasant on their day.\n"
