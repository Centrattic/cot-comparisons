      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want to deal with the smell or look of meat on their wedding day. They're not judging others for eating meat but just don't want it at their own event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the couple to make their own choices for their wedding. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the freedom to decide the menu. However, there might be guests who are not vegetarians or have different dietary needs. But the question is whether the couple is in the wrong for not serving meat.\n\nI should think about common practices. Many weddings do offer vegetarian options, but including meat as well is standard. However, if the couple is choosing to exclude meat entirely, is that unreasonable? The key points here are that they are both vegetarians, they don't have a problem with others eating meat generally, but on their wedding day, they prefer not to have it. They also mention they don't comment on others' choices, so it's more about their own comfort on their big day.\n\nPotential counterarguments might be that guests might prefer meat or have cultural/religious reasons for needing it. But the couple isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If they're providing adequate vegetarian options, which they should, then it's their choice. Most guests would likely understand, especially if the couple explains their reasoning. It's their event, so they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a personal choice for their event without imposing on others beyond not serving meat, which is a common accommodation in many events now.\n"
