      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The situation is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding day to exclude meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing what's served at their own event. The question is whether this is acceptable or if they are in the wrong.\n\nI think about personal choices in weddings. Weddings are personal events, and couples usually have the right to decide the details, including the menu. Unless there are specific cultural or religious traditions that require meat, which isn't mentioned here, it's their right to choose a vegetarian menu. However, there's a consideration for guests who might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they should offer alternatives.\n\nThe author mentions they have no problem with others eating meat but just don't want to be around it on their wedding day. That seems reasonable. If someone else were to force them to eat meat, that would be different, but they're making their own choice for their event. Also, it's their money and their day, so unless they are excluding guests for discriminatory reasons, which isn't the case here, they aren't in the wrong.\n\nHowever, maybe some might argue that not offering meat could inconvenience guests. But the author didn't say they would refuse to accommodate vegetarians; rather, they're making the entire reception vegetarian. If they had a meat option but also a vegetarian one, that would be different. But since they're choosing a vegetarian-only menu based on their own preferences, I don't think they're in the wrong.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
