      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple's preferences are usually respected. Since the couple is vegetarian and they're hosting the event, they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, some guests might not be vegetarian and might expect meat options. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat meat; they're choosing their own event's menu. It's their day, so their priorities should take precedence. The fact that they don't have issues with others eating meat in general but just don't want it on their wedding day seems reasonable. They aren't making a judgment but just creating a space that's comfortable for them. So the answer is probably B, No. They're not in the wrong.\n"
