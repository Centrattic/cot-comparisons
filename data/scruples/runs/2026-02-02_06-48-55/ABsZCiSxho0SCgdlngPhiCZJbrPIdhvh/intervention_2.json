      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where they want only vegetarian meals because they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but don't want it on their wedding day because of the smell or look, even though they don't comment on others eating meat otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple is strict vegetarians, which means they have a strong ethical or dietary stance. They are planning their wedding and want the reception to be vegetarian. The question is whether this makes them the \"asshole\" in the situation.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around weddings. Weddings are typically inclusive events where guests come from various backgrounds. However, the couple is the one getting married, so they have the right to make decisions about their own event. They are not forcing anyone else to be vegetarian; they're just choosing what to serve. \n\nThere might be guests who are not vegetarian and might not eat anything if there's no meat option. But the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food or having other options. The problem here is the assumption that the couple must accommodate non-vegetarian guests. However, the couple is making a personal choice based on their preferences and values. \n\nAnother angle is that they are not imposing their views on others. They don't comment on others eating meat, just choose not to serve it at their event. It's their celebration, and they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that a wedding is a time to consider all guests, but the couple isn't making their guests eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. It's a personal choice, and as long as they communicate it clearly, it's reasonable. \n\nI think the main point is whether the couple is being inconsiderate. They are being considerate by not forcing their views but choosing a menu that aligns with their lifestyle. They are not making guests eat against their will. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
