      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them but want the wedding to be meat-free. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple's dietary preferences are strict, so it's their choice to have a vegetarian menu. Weddings are personal events, so they have the right to make such decisions. However, they might be excluding guests who eat meat and can't or don't want to eat vegetarian. The question is about whether that's acceptable.\n\nLooking at possible arguments: On one hand, the couple has the right to their preferences and can choose the menu as they see fit. On the other hand, guests might not have vegetarian options and might feel it's inconsiderate. However, the couple isn't forcing others to eat the same; they're just not providing meat. They might have to inform guests in advance, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nAlso, the couple mentions they never comment on others eating meat but just avoid it themselves. So, they're not being judgmental but prefer their own space to be meat-free. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, having a vegetarian wedding is becoming more common as people's dietary choices diversify. It's their event, so they can make such choices as long as they're not discriminatory. Unless there's a cultural or religious aspect that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, they're within their rights.\n\nThe answer might depend on whether they provided advance notice to guests. If they did, then it's their choice. If not, some guests might be inconvenienced. However, the question doesn't mention that part. The core issue is about their right to choose the menu based on their preferences without being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their dietary preferences, even if it affects guests, as long as they communicate properly.\n"
