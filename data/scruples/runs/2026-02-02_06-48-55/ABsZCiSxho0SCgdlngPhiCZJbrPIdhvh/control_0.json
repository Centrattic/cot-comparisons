      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The partners are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't want to eat it, but they don't judge others. The wedding reception would have no meat options. The question is asking if that's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of personal choice and respect. The couple has the right to make their wedding reflect their personal values and dietary preferences. Since they're both vegetarians, it makes sense they'd want their special day to align with that. They're not forcing others to be vegetarian, just choosing their own menu. The key point is that they're not imposing their views on others; they're only making choices for themselves and their partner.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of guests. Do guests have a right to expect meat at a wedding? Well, traditionally, maybe, but traditions can vary. If the couple is clear about the vegetarian-only menu during the invitations, guests might come expecting that. If they weren't informed, some might be surprised, but the couple isn't obligated to provide meat just because it's customary. They can set their own rules for their event. \n\nAlso, considering inclusivity, maybe some guests have dietary restrictions that aren't meat-based, so the couple should ensure there are enough options for all. But the question specifies that the issue is about meat. Since the couple is providing vegetarian meals, they're catering to their own preferences and possibly others who might be vegetarian or have similar tastes. They aren't excluding anyone from eating; they\u2019re just not serving meat. \n\nAnother angle: if a guest has a medical reason to eat meat, but that's rare. Most people can adapt to a vegetarian menu, especially for a single event. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food, just not offering meat. So they aren't in the wrong for making their own choices. They are respecting their own preferences and not making others feel judged, which was their policy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They\u2019re making a personal choice that doesn\u2019t infringe on others' rights as long as they communicate it properly. Guests can choose to eat what's provided or bring their own food if necessary. The couple isn't being unreasonable here.\n"
