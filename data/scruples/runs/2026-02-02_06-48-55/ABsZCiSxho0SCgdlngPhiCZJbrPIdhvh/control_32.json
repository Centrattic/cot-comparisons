      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So the scenario is both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look gross. They don't comment on others eating around them but want their wedding reception to have no meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether hosting a vegetarian-only wedding makes them the \"asshole\" in this situation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe couple has the right to plan their wedding as they see fit. Weddings are personal events, and guests are expected to accommodate the hosts' preferences. Even though some guests might prefer meat, the hosts aren't obligated to provide it. The couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. It's their day, so their preferences should take precedence. Also, they mentioned they don't comment on others eating meat elsewhere, so this is about their specific event. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say guests should have options, but vegetarianism is a valid choice, and the couple isn't excluding others' dietary needs unless specified. If guests have dietary restrictions, they can bring their own food or the couple could offer alternatives, but the question is about them choosing vegetarian meals. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're hosting their wedding and making choices that align with their values and preferences. It's their right to do so without being judged as the \"asshole.\"\n"
