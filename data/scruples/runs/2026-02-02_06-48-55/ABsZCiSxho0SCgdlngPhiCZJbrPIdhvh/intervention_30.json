      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The author is a strict vegetarian along with their partner, and they want their wedding to not have meat because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but just don't want it on their wedding day. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on how their day is planned. The couple is choosing their preferences, which in this case is vegetarian food. But there's a potential issue if guests have dietary restrictions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not offering meat options.\n\nI should think about common practices. Many weddings do offer a variety of food, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. However, it's not uncommon for couples to choose a specific theme or dietary preference for their reception. If the couple is transparent about the vegetarian-only menu when sending out invitations, they're not necessarily being inconsiderate. But maybe some guests might be upset if they can't eat meat, especially if they didn't know beforehand.\n\nAnother angle is whether the couple is being respectful of their guests' preferences. The author mentions that they don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but just don't want it on their day. That seems like a personal choice. However, if there are guests with dietary needs (like non-vegetarian guests), not having meat might cause inconvenience. But it's also the couple's right to set their own preferences.\n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural or traditional aspect. In some cultures, weddings might expect a certain variety of food, including meat. But in others, vegetarian weddings are common. The key here is that the couple is making a choice that aligns with their lifestyle. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess whether that's justified. The author isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. The problem would arise if the couple is being inconsiderate by not providing alternatives. However, vegetarian meals can be diverse and satisfying. Unless the couple is aware of guests with specific dietary needs (like allergies or religious requirements) that can't be met with vegetarian options, it's their choice.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether they communicated the menu in advance and if they're accommodating guests' needs. If they did communicate and made sure the vegetarian options are tasty and varied, then they're not in the wrong. If they didn't consider guests who might prefer or need meat, then maybe they are. But the post doesn't mention that the couple is ignoring guest accommodations. The couple's own preferences are valid, and they have the right to make their wedding reflect their lifestyle.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
