      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who's planning a vegetarian wedding is in the wrong for not serving meat. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they find the smell or look of meat gross, so they don't want it at their wedding. The key here is whether their decision is reasonable and if they're being unfair to guests.\n\nFirst, a wedding is a personal event, so the couple has the right to make choices based on their preferences. They mentioned they don't mind others eating meat in general, just not on their wedding day. That seems respectful because they don't comment on others' choices elsewhere. The issue is whether they have to accommodate guests who might want meat. \n\nBut, they are providing a meal that fits their dietary preferences. However, not everyone might be vegetarian, so some guests could be disappointed. The question is about whether they're in the wrong for not offering meat options. \n\nI think it's important to note that while it's their right to have a vegetarian menu, they should communicate this clearly so guests are prepared. If they're not offering meat, they should make sure there are alternatives that everyone can enjoy. Also, maybe offering a separate meat option isn't necessary if they clearly state their choice and guests can bring their own if needed. \n\nBut the key point is that the couple's choice is their own, and as long as they're not forcing others to eat something they don't want, they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
