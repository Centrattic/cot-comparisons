      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They never comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding day to be free of meat. The main question is whether they're being unreasonable by not providing meat options at their reception.\n\nI need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and couples often make decisions based on their preferences. It's common for couples to have specific dietary choices, especially if they have dietary restrictions or ethical beliefs. However, some guests might not be vegetarian, so not offering meat could be a problem for them.\n\nBut the scenario mentions that the couple is strict vegetarians and have no issues with others eating meat otherwise. They're just trying to avoid meat on their day. So, maybe they're being respectful of their own comfort but not considering others' needs.\n\nI should also think about inclusivity. Guests might have various dietary needs\u2014some might be allergic, have religious restrictions, or just prefer meat. By only serving vegetarian, are they excluding those guests? On the other hand, the couple has every right to make their event reflect their values.\n\nAnother angle is the practical aspect. The couple can provide vegetarian meals for themselves while still offering meat options for guests. That way, everyone is accommodated. But maybe the caterer or venue doesn't allow that, or the couple is trying to keep it simple. If they're not forcing anyone's hand, but the menu is entirely vegetarian, some guests might feel left out.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether they're in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The couple's intent is to have a vegetarian wedding because of their own comfort. The impact is that some guests might not have their dietary needs met. However, if the couple is communicating this in advance and guests can bring their own food or adjust, maybe it's not a problem. But if they don't offer alternatives, that could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the couple did mention they have no issues with others eating meat in general. They're not judging others, just their own event. So their reasoning is personal preference, which is valid. But weddings are also about including guests. There's a balance between personal choice and guest accommodation.\n\nIn many cases, couples do have mixed menus, but it's not mandatory. The answer might depend on cultural expectations. In some places, it's perfectly acceptable for a vegetarian couple to have a vegetarian wedding. In others, guests might expect meat options. The key is whether the couple is being considerate. Since they didn't serve meat, but it's their choice, and they're not forcing anyone to eat it, they're not necessarily in the wrong. But if they're not providing alternatives for non-vegetarians, that could be an issue.\n\nWait, but the question is about whether they are in the wrong. If the couple is clear about their choice and guests are informed, it's their right. If they don't offer meat, but guests have other options (like vegetarian dishes that non-vegetarians can eat), then it's okay. However, if some guests can't eat vegetarian for medical or religious reasons, the couple should accommodate them. But the scenario doesn't mention that; it's about the couple's personal preference.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No, they're not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice that aligns with their values and they're not forcing others. However, some might argue they should offer meat for non-vegetarian guests. But in the absence of specific guest needs, it's their event. The answer hinges on whether the couple is being considerate. Since they didn't mention excluding guests due to dietary restrictions beyond their own, but are making a personal choice, it's more likely they're not in the wrong.\n"
