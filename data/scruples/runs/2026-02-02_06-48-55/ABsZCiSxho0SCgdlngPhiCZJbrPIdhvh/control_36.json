      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want to avoid it. The question is whether they're in the wrong for having a meat-free reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles involved here. The main points are personal choice, respect for others' dietary preferences, and the context of a wedding. Weddings are personal events, so the hosts typically have the right to decide the menu based on their preferences. The couple is being clear about their own choices and isn't imposing their views on others. They also mention that they don't comment on others eating meat, so they aren't being judgmental. However, some guests might expect meat options, especially if they have a preference or dietary needs that aren't met by vegetarian dishes. But the couple is not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just providing the menu they want for their day. \n\nIn many cases, weddings do offer a variety of options, but it's not mandatory. The couple has the right to make their event reflect their lifestyle. The key here is that they're not discriminating or making judgments, just making a choice that aligns with their values. Since they're not causing harm and are providing a meal that fits their preferences, it's a matter of personal choice. Therefore, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
