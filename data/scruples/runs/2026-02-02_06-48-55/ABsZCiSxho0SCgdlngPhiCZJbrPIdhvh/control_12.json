      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they prefer not to have meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. The key points here are that both partners are strict vegetarians and they've made a choice to have a vegetarian menu. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not offering meat. The guests can bring their own food if they want, but typically, weddings provide the meals for guests.\n\nNow, the question is whether this choice is unreasonable. The couple isn't discriminating against anyone's dietary preferences beyond their own. They're not making guests eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Some guests might prefer meat, but the couple has every right to have a menu that aligns with their values and comfort. It's their special day, and they have the autonomy to make such decisions. \n\nPotential counterarguments might be that guests might have different dietary needs, but the scenario doesn't mention that the couple is excluding other dietary options. Also, they're not commenting on others' choices, just their own. So it's a personal choice that doesn't infringe on others' rights. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
