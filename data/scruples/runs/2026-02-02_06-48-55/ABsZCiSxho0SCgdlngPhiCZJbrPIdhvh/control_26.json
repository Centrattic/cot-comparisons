      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't mind others eating meat in general but want their wedding to be meat-free. They're not telling others not to eat meat but just not serving it. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for having a vegetarian-only reception.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the couple has the right to make choices for their own event. Weddings are personal, and they can set the menu as they wish. Their dietary preferences are valid, and they're not forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not providing the option. Plus, they aren't judging others' choices, just avoiding meat themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, some guests might prefer meat, so not offering it could be inconvenient. But the couple isn't preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere, just not serving it at the wedding. It's a private event, so the hosts have the authority to decide the menu. As long as they communicate this in advance, guests can make arrangements if needed. \n\nAlso, being strict vegetarians might mean they have strong reasons, like ethical or health, so it's their right to uphold their beliefs. The key here is that they aren't imposing their views on others but simply not serving meat themselves. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences without forcing others to conform.\n"
