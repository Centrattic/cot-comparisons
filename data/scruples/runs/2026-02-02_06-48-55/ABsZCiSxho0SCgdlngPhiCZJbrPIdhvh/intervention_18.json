      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on the details. They're making choices based on their lifestyle and preferences. Since they're strict vegetarians and have no issue with others eating meat, but they want to avoid it on their special day, it's about their comfort. However, guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences they rely on. But the couple is providing the menu, so they can set the terms. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not offering meat. If guests have dietary needs that require meat, the couple could offer alternatives, but the question is whether they're obligated to include meat. The author isn't in the wrong because it's their event. But maybe some guests might feel excluded if they have no meat options. However, the couple isn't preventing guests from eating elsewhere if they can't attend. The key point is that the couple has the right to make their event reflect their values. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
