      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable to have only vegetarian meals at their wedding. The author and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat off-putting. They don't want meat served at their wedding reception, even though they don't mind others eating meat elsewhere. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple often makes decisions based on their preferences. Since both the author and their partner are vegetarian, it's reasonable for them to want their wedding to reflect their dietary choices. However, guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the author mentions that they aren't trying to impose their views on others\u2014they just don't want meat served. The key here is that they aren't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If the menu is vegetarian, guests can still choose their own meals if there are enough options provided. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. People often have strong opinions about this. Some might argue that the wedding is the couple's event and they have the right to set the menu as they wish. Others might think that not offering meat could alienate guests who prefer or require it. However, the author isn't providing meat, but they aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian either. If the menu is well-planned with vegetarian options that accommodate different dietary needs (like maybe some guests are vegetarian for different reasons), then it's manageable. \n\nAnother angle is the reasoning provided. The author says they never comment on others eating meat but just want their own day to be free of it. That seems respectful. They\u2019re not dictating others' choices but setting their own preferences. I think the main issue is whether guests will have enough food options. If the menu is vegetarian and there are enough variety, then it's a personal choice. The author isn't making guests eat meat; they\u2019re just not serving it. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Weddings are personal, and as long as the menu is accommodating in other ways (like maybe offering various vegetarian dishes that can be appealing to all guests), the couple has the right to have a vegetarian-only reception. The guests can take the food provided, and if they don't like it, they can bring their own, though that's less common. The key is that the author isn't imposing their views but expressing their own preferences for their special day.\n"
