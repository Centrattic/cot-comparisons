      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault (AITA) for having only vegetarian meals at their wedding, given that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They mention they don't have issues with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them but want to avoid it on their wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Weddings are often about the couple's preferences and values, so it's reasonable for them to choose a menu that aligns with their dietary choices. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and many people have strong reasons for it, including ethical, health, or environmental concerns. The couple isn't imposing their views on others; they're simply choosing their own event's menu.\n\nHowever, some might argue that guests could have dietary preferences or restrictions that aren't vegetarian. The couple should consider offering meat alternatives if they know their guests have such preferences. But the scenario doesn't mention that they're serving only vegetarian food at the expense of others' dietary needs. It says they serve vegetarian meals, not that they exclude other options. Wait, actually, the question is whether the reception has no meat options. So the menu is entirely vegetarian. \n\nIn that case, if guests have different dietary needs, like needing meat, they might not have options. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they're just not serving meat. It's their event, so they have the right to choose the menu based on their preferences. However, maybe they should have offered alternative meat dishes for those who prefer them. But the key point is that the couple is strict vegetarians, and they're not commenting on others' choices. They're just not having meat at their own wedding. \n\nIn many cases, people do customize their weddings to their tastes, so this seems reasonable. Others might be upset if they have to eat vegetarian food, but it's the couple's right to set the menu. Unless there's a cultural expectation that weddings must include meat, which varies by region, but the scenario doesn't specify that. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose a vegetarian menu for their wedding, especially when both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. The fact that they don't impose their views on others outside the wedding also supports their stance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
