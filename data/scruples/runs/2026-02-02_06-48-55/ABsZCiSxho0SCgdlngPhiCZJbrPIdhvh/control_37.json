      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple is strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served, even though they don't mind others eating meat. They find the smell and look of meat gross but don't say anything to others. The question is if they're at fault for not having meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is their event, so they have the right to choose the menu based on their preferences. Being a vegetarian is a personal choice, and their dietary restrictions are strict. They mentioned they don't judge others for eating meat, so their stance isn't about imposing on others but about their own comfort on their special day.\n\nHowever, some guests might have dietary needs that require meat. If the couple didn't communicate this in advance or offer alternatives, that could be an issue. But the scenario doesn't mention that. They just state their own preferences and the reason. \n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings are personal events where the hosts can set the tone. While it's considerate to accommodate guests, the couple's own comfort is also valid. They are not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food; they're just choosing what's served. If the guests knew upfront and still attended, they might be expected to comply, but the hosts should also ensure that the menu includes sufficient vegetarian options that cater to various dietary needs beyond just their own.\n\nBut the key here is that the couple is strict vegetarians and find meat's presence unpleasant. Their choice is about maintaining their personal comfort and aligning the event with their values. Unless they're excluding guests who have medical or cultural reasons for eating meat, which isn't indicated here, their decision is reasonable. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), they aren't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their lifestyle and preferences, especially if they communicated it in advance and provided adequate vegetarian options. The scenario doesn't mention any guests being excluded or offended beyond the presence of meat, which is a personal choice.\n"
