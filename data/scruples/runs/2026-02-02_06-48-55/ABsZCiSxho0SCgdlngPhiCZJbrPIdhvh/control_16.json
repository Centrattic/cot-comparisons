      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who's planning a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. So, the situation is both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they want the wedding reception to be vegetarian. They don't have a problem with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross, so they don't want it at their own wedding. They're asking if they're at fault for not offering meat options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The couple's personal dietary choices and their comfort level. Since they're both vegetarians, it's their choice to have a vegetarian wedding. Weddings are personal events, so they should be able to set the menu according to their preferences. However, some might argue that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences, like non-vegetarians or people with certain restrictions. But the key here is that the couple is not imposing their choice on others; they're just making their own event reflect their lifestyle. \n\nThe question mentions they don't say anything about others eating meat in general, just on their wedding day they want to avoid it. That shows respect for others' choices in everyday life, but on their special day, they have the right to set the terms. It's their money, their event, and their values. \n\nPotential counterarguments could be about accommodating guests, but typically, people plan weddings with their preferences in mind. If guests have issues, they can bring their own food or adjust, though that's not common. The couple isn't preventing guests from eating meat elsewhere, just not serving it at their event. \n\nAlso, from a social norm perspective, it's becoming more common to have vegetarian options as more people adopt plant-based diets. So having a fully vegetarian menu isn't unusual anymore. Unless there's a specific cultural or religious expectation that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, the couple is within their rights. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No), they're not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice that aligns with their values and comfort, and it's their event to manage as they see fit.\n"
