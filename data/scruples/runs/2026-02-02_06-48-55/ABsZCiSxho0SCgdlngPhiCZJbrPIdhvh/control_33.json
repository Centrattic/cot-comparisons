      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. The couple are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise, but on their day, they just want to avoid it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple's choice is based on their personal preferences and dietary habits. They aren't forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. The question is whether this makes them the \"asshole\" (AITA). \n\nI should think about the rights of individuals to make personal choices for their own event. Weddings are personal, and guests usually accommodate the couple's wishes. However, maybe some guests might have dietary needs or preferences that aren't met by vegetarian meals. But the couple isn't excluding options; they're just not offering meat. Wait, the question says the reception has no meat options. So guests who want meat can't have it. But the couple isn't serving meat, not that they are forcing others to eat vegetarian. \n\nBut maybe some guests might be offended or feel their preferences aren't considered. However, the couple's reasoning is that they find the smell or look of meat unpleasant on their day. It's their wedding, so their comfort is important. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat normally, so it's not a judgmental stance, just a personal choice for their special day. \n\nI should check if there's a common expectation that weddings have a variety of options. But many weddings cater to different diets, like gluten-free, vegan, etc. However, if the couple is vegetarian, making the entire menu vegetarian is their choice. The key is whether they communicated this in advance. If they did, guests can plan accordingly. The couple isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice for their event, not imposing on others beyond their own preferences. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their lifestyle and comfort, provided they inform guests in advance. Guests can adjust or bring their own meals if needed, but the couple isn't obligated to serve meat.\n"
