      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who plans a vegetarian-only wedding is at fault. The situation is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others' choices, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to be vegetarian-only. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main factors here. The couple is making personal choices for their own event. Weddings are personal events where the hosts can set the tone and menu according to their preferences. The fact that they are strict vegetarians and have their reasons (discomfort with the smell/look of meat) is important. They aren't forcing others to eat vegetarian, just choosing their own event's menu. \n\nI should think about whether this is a reasonable choice. People often have dietary restrictions or preferences for their weddings, like kosher, halal, or vegetarian options. Serving vegetarian meals exclusively might limit the choices for guests who aren't vegetarian, but the couple is within their rights to decide the menu. They\u2019re not denying meat options; they\u2019re just not providing them. \n\nAnother angle is the guests' perspective. Some guests might prefer meat, but the couple is explaining their reasoning. Since they aren't commenting on others' choices in general, it's about their own comfort on a significant day. It's their event, so they get to decide. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some places, meat is traditional at weddings, but that's changing with more vegetarian options becoming common. The couple's choice reflects their personal values and comfort. They\u2019re not being judgmental but just creating a space that's comfortable for them. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say it's inconsiderate, but the couple is aware of their preferences and isn't forcing anyone. They\u2019re not stopping guests from bringing their own food, just serving what they prefer. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the couple is making a personal choice for their event, which is their right. The answer is probably B, No, they are not in the wrong.\n"
