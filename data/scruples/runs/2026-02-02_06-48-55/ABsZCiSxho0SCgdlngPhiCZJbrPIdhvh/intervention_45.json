      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, but they don't tell others not to eat it. They just want their wedding day to avoid meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is about personal choice versus accommodating guests. Weddings are usually about celebrating the couple's union, so they should have the right to decide the menu that aligns with their values and preferences. However, some guests might not be vegetarians and might expect a variety of options. \n\nBut the couple isn't forcing others to adopt their diet; they're just not serving meat. It's their day and their event, so they have the right to make such choices. Maybe some guests might feel inconvenienced, but the couple isn't being rude about it. They don't comment on others' eating habits otherwise. It's about creating a comfortable environment for themselves on an important day.\n\nI think the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their personal preferences and dietary restrictions. However, maybe there's a nuance if they didn't inform guests beforehand. But the question doesn't mention that. So, if they did communicate properly, it's their choice. If not, maybe some could be upset, but the scenario states they don't have a problem with others eating meat generally, just not on their day. So the answer is B.\n"
