      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They mention that they don't mind others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to deal with it on their wedding day. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events where couples often make choices based on their preferences and values. Vegetarianism is a personal choice for many, and it's becoming more common. If the couple is strict vegetarians, they might want their wedding to reflect their lifestyle. It's their day to celebrate, so they have the right to make such a choice.\n\nHowever, some guests might not be vegetarians. The question is whether the couple should offer meat options. But the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. Guests can bring their own food if they really can't adjust, though that's a stretch. Most people would likely respect the couple's wishes, especially if they're informed beforehand. Additionally, many vegetarian dishes can be satisfying for everyone, so maybe the guests won't even miss the meat.\n\nThe couple isn't shaming others for eating meat, which is important. They're just applying their own preference to their event. It's similar to a couple choosing a different type of cuisine or dietary restrictions for religious reasons. So, the author is not in the wrong because it's their right to have a vegetarian wedding. The answer should be B.\n"
