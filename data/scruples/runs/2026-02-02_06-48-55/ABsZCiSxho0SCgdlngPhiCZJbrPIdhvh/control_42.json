      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The question is whether serving only vegetarian meals at the wedding makes them the antagonist (AITA).\n\nI need to consider a few factors. Weddings are personal events, and people often have specific preferences. The couple is clear about their dietary choices and their reasons. They don't impose their views on others in daily life but want their special day to reflect their values. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, guests usually accommodate hosts' preferences unless there are specific dietary needs. The hosts have the right to set the menu for their own event. However, maybe some guests might not eat vegetarian, but the hosts can offer vegetarian options to all. Since the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian, just not providing meat, it's their choice. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or social norm that makes this a problem. In many places, vegetarian or vegan weddings are becoming more common. People have the right to choose their dietary practices for their event. Unless there's a specific reason to include meat, the hosts aren't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice that aligns with their values for their special day without imposing on others except in the context of their own event.\n"
