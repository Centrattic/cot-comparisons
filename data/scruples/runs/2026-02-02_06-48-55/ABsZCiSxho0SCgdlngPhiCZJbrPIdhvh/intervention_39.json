      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding is in the wrong. The writer and their partner are strict vegetarians and don't want meat served because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat but want their wedding to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where couples often make specific choices based on their preferences. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, and many people have dietary restrictions or preferences. The couple isn't forcing others to be vegetarian, just not serving meat. They're not commenting on others' choices, just their own event.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Some guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. Maybe some guests are non-vegetarians and might not have options. But the couple isn't excluding anyone; they're just not serving meat. They could offer a variety of vegetarian dishes. Also, the couple has a right to their own preferences on their special day.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe some guests would appreciate having meat options. However, the couple might not have the resources or desire to prepare both. Also, vegetarian meals can be just as satisfying. The key point is that the couple is being consistent with their own values and isn't imposing on others beyond their event.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the couple has the right to make choices for their own wedding. They're not forcing others to adopt their diet, just ensuring their event aligns with their preferences. It's their day to celebrate their way.\n"
