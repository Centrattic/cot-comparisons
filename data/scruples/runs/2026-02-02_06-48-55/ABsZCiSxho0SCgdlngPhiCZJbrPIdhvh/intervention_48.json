      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and they don't want meat served at their wedding reception. They mention they don't have issues with others eating meat in general but just find the smell or look of it gross. They also say they never comment on others eating meat around them but want their wedding day to be meat-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The couple's personal dietary preferences are strict, and they want to avoid meat for their own comfort. Weddings are personal events, and traditionally, guests are expected to accommodate the hosts' preferences. But there's also the aspect of guests having their own dietary needs. However, in this case, the couple isn't excluding meat for religious reasons but personal preference. Wait, but is that different from other personal choices, like a vegan wedding or a specific cultural cuisine?\n\nI remember that some people argue that dietary restrictions due to health or religion are different from personal preferences. But vegetarianism can sometimes be a personal choice. However, if the couple is strict vegetarians, their choice isn't just preference but a lifestyle. Also, they mention they don't comment on others eating meat, so it's about their own comfort rather than imposing on others.\n\nAnother angle is that while the couple has the right to choose their wedding menu, they should consider guests who might have different dietary needs. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not offering meat options. If they don't provide meat, guests who want it can still bring their own, but that's impractical. However, the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian food; they're just not serving meat. It's their event, so they have the right to set the menu. \n\nBut then there's the idea that hosting a wedding is a social event where the host is expected to make some accommodations for guests. However, the guests should also respect the hosts' wishes. So, if the hosts are clear about their preferences, guests can adjust accordingly. The couple is also not making a moral judgment on meat consumption but just prefer not to have it on their day. \n\nI think the key here is that the couple is making a personal choice based on their lifestyle and comfort without imposing their beliefs on others. They\u2019re not banning meat for others, just choosing their own menu. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
