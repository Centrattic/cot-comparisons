      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but for their wedding, they want no meat options. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple is making a personal choice based on their dietary preferences and comfort. Weddings are personal events, so they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, they should also consider their guests. Are there guests who might require meat options? For example, some people might be unable to eat vegetarian, have allergies, or cultural reasons for needing meat. But the couple hasn't mentioned any of these factors.\n\nBut the key here is that they are strict vegetarians and find the presence of meat unpleasant. Their wedding is their day, so they have the right to choose the menu. However, not offering meat might inconvenience some guests. But the couple says they don't have an issue with others eating meat generally, just during their wedding. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, they're not in the wrong). Weddings are personal, and guests are expected to accommodate the hosts' preferences. However, maybe the couple should provide some non-meat options for guests who might prefer it. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only menu. The answer would depend on cultural norms and expectations. In many places, it's acceptable to have a vegetarian-only menu if the hosts are vegetarian, as long as they communicate it to guests in advance. The couple also mentions they don't comment on others eating meat, so their stance isn't about condemning others but about their comfort on their big day. Therefore, they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
