      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple is strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat gross. They don't have an issue with others eating meat in general but want their wedding day to be meat-free. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main arguments for and against the author being in the wrong. On one hand, a wedding is a personal event, and the couple should have the right to plan it according to their preferences and values. Being vegetarian is a personal choice, and if they're comfortable with that lifestyle, it makes sense they'd want their special day to reflect that. Also, they mentioned they don't comment on others' meat consumption in general, so it's not out of judgment but personal comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. For example, if someone is a meat-eater, they might feel left out or have difficulty eating. However, the couple could offer alternative options like a separate menu or ensure there are plenty of other non-meat dishes. But the question is whether it's wrong to have no meat options at all. \n\nAnother angle is that the couple's own comfort is important. They are the hosts, and their wedding should be a celebration of their union. If they're uncomfortable with meat, it's reasonable they'd want to avoid it. Plus, vegetarian meals can be just as varied and satisfying as meat-based ones, so guests shouldn't suffer if the menu is well-planned.\n\nI also need to think about societal norms. While some might expect meat, it's becoming more common to have vegetarian options or even entirely vegetarian menus. With the rise in plant-based diets, this might not be as unusual as it once was. Guests can be informed beforehand, and the couple can communicate that it's a vegetarian wedding, which is their choice.\n\nHowever, there's a possible issue of not accommodating all guests' needs. But the couple isn't forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. If guests have other dietary needs (like gluten-free, etc.), the couple should address those. But the absence of meat doesn't inherently make the author wrong unless it's causing harm or exclusion without alternatives.\n\nSo, considering all this, the main point is the couple's right to plan their event as they wish. They are not imposing their beliefs on others but making a personal choice for their day. Therefore, the answer would likely be that they are not in the wrong.\n"
