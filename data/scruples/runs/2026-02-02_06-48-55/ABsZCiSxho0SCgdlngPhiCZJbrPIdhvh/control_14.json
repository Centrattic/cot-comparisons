      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general but don't want to deal with the smell or look of it on their wedding day. They aren't stopping guests from eating meat elsewhere, just their own reception.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the right to set the menu according to their preferences. Since they're both vegetarian, it makes sense they might prefer a vegetarian menu. But some might argue that guests could have dietary preferences or needs that aren't vegetarian. However, the question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong for not serving meat.\n\nI should also think about whether the couple is accommodating guests. If they're providing vegetarian options and maybe even some non-vegetarian options, but the scenario says \"no meat options,\" so it's entirely vegetarian. Wait, the user says \"the reception has no meat options,\" so it's exclusively vegetarian. But they mention they don't mind others eating meat elsewhere, just not on their wedding day. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Guests might have dietary restrictions, but the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian. It's their choice for their event. Also, maybe some guests might not eat vegetarian for cultural or religious reasons. However, the couple isn't preventing guests from bringing their own food or having alternatives elsewhere. \n\nI should also consider if there's any obligation to include meat. In many cultures, meat is a standard part of weddings, but it's not a universal rule. The couple's choice is personal. They are not making a judgment on others' diets, just their own preference for the event.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The couple has the right to choose their wedding menu based on their dietary preferences and comfort. They aren't imposing their choice on guests beyond the event's setup. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they are not in the wrong).\n"
