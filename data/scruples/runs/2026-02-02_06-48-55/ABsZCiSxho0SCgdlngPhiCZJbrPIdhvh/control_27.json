      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wants to have a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat generally, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't say anything when others eat meat around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want to deal with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on how they want their day to be. Since they are both vegetarians, choosing a vegetarian menu aligns with their personal preferences and values. It's their right to decide the catering for their own wedding.\n\nHowever, some might argue that guests might have different dietary needs or preferences. But the key point here is that the couple is providing a meal that matches their own lifestyle. They're not forcing others to eat vegetarian food; they're just choosing not to serve meat. If they are prepared to offer vegetarian options, which they are, then it's a valid choice. Guests who have different dietary needs could bring their own food or have the option of not eating, though that's less common. But in many cases, people understand that a wedding is the couple's celebration, and they adjust accordingly.\n\nAnother angle is that the couple isn't imposing their choices on others in other situations, but on their special day, they want it to reflect their values. That makes sense. Plus, they're not making a judgment about others' choices, just setting their own boundaries for the event they're hosting. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to make their wedding reflect their personal preferences without feeling guilty.\n"
