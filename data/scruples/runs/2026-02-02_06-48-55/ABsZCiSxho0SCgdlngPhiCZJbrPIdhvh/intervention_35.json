      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for planning a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find the smell or look of meat off-putting. They don't comment on others eating meat but want their wedding day to be free of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can set the tone and preferences. Since they're both vegetarians, it makes sense they'd prefer vegetarian meals. However, serving only vegetarian food might affect guests who aren't vegetarian. Are guests expecting meat options? Maybe some might be disappointed or feel excluded if they can't have meat. But on the other hand, the couple has the right to choose their own celebration's details. \n\nAnother angle is whether they communicated this choice to their guests. If they mentioned the vegetarian-only menu beforehand, guests could adjust. If not, some might be surprised. Also, are there vegetarian alternatives that still satisfy everyone? Maybe the menu offers a variety of vegetarian dishes that are appealing, so even non-vegetarians don't miss meat. \n\nBut the key point is that the couple has the right to their preferences. It's their day, and they're not forcing anyone to eat vegetarian food. It's a choice they're making based on their lifestyle. Guests can choose to eat what's provided or bring their own food if they're uncomfortable. So, is it wrong? If the couple is respectful and communicates their choice, then no. But if they're being inconsiderate, maybe yes. But in the scenario, they don't say anything about others eating meat elsewhere, just their own event. So they're not judging others, just personal preference.\n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their wedding menu based on their dietary preferences and comfort level. It's a personal choice, especially when they're not imposing it on others outside their event.\n"
