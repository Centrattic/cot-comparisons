      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians and they find meat's smell or look gross, so they don't want meat served at their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is strict vegetarians, they don't eat meat, and they don't want to deal with the smell or sight of it on their wedding day. They don't make a big deal about others eating meat, but their own event is different. The question is whether serving only vegetarian is being in the wrong.\n\nFrom my understanding, people have the right to make personal choices for their own events. Weddings are personal events, and the couple is entitled to have their preferences respected. Since they're not forcing others to eat vegetarian, but just not serving meat, it's their choice. Guests who can't eat vegetarian can bring their own food or choose to not attend, though that's unlikely. The couple isn't discriminating by refusing to serve meat; they're accommodating their dietary preferences and lifestyle.\n\nOn the flip side, some people might argue that not providing meat could inconvenience guests, especially those who are used to eating meat. However, the couple isn't saying guests can't eat meat elsewhere, just that their event is vegetarian. It's a personal choice, not a judgment on others. They also mentioned they never comment on others eating meat, so they're not being confrontational.\n\nTherefore, the couple isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make their wedding reflect their values and preferences. The answer should be B.\n"
