      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple are both strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they don't want to deal with it. So they're planning to have no meat options at their wedding reception. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the rights of the couple versus the guests. The couple is making a personal choice about their own event. Weddings are usually personal and reflect the couple's preferences. However, some guests might be non-vegetarians and might not have a meat alternative available. But the couple isn't serving meat because they're against it, just because they find it gross. They also don't comment on others eating meat, so it's not about enforcing their beliefs but about their comfort on their day.\n\nI think the key points here are: it's their wedding, they have the right to make choices about the menu, and they're not forcing others to be vegetarian. They're just avoiding meat themselves. But there's a potential issue if guests expect meat options. However, in modern times, many weddings offer diverse menus, including vegetarian options. If they're making that choice, they should probably inform guests in advance and maybe offer alternative non-meat dishes that are appealing. But the core issue is whether it's wrong to not have meat. \n\nSociety often respects personal choices in events they host, as long as they're not discriminatory. Vegetarianism is a personal choice, not a protected class, so excluding meat isn't against the law. The couple isn't making others follow their diet, just not serving it. So I think they're within their rights. Maybe some guests might be inconvenienced, but that's part of hosting any event where preferences differ. The couple has a right to their comfort on their special day. So answer B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
