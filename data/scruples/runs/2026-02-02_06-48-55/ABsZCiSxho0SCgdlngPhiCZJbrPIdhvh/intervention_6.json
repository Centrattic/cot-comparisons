      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians, and they don't mind others eating meat but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't want to deal with it on their wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple's preferences are usually respected. Since the couple is vegetarian and they want a vegetarian menu, that's their choice. But they also mention they have no issues with others eating meat in general. However, on their wedding day, they prefer not to have meat. \n\nI should think about whether this is reasonable. If they're hosting a private event, they can set the terms. But some guests might not be vegetarian and might not eat if there's no meat. However, the couple has the right to make their own choices for their event. Maybe they can offer a note or a statement explaining their choice to guests in advance. \n\nThe person is asking if they are at fault. The key points here are personal choice versus accommodating guests. Since it's their wedding, they aren't in the wrong for making a personal choice, especially when they are clear about their reasons. They also mention they don't comment on others eating meat elsewhere, so this isn't about judgment but personal comfort on their day. \n\nBut maybe some people might think guests should have options. However, the couple isn't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just choosing the menu. So the answer should be B (No), they aren't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding menu based on their preferences.\n"
