      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong by only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Let's start by understanding the situation. Both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have issues with others eating meat generally, but they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating around them, but on their wedding day, they want the reception to have no meat options. The question is whether they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. A wedding is a personal event, and the couple is allowed to make choices that reflect their lifestyle and preferences. Since they are both vegetarian, it's their right to have the menu align with their dietary choices. They also mention they don't mind others eating meat otherwise, so it's not about imposing on others, just their own event. \n\nHowever, some guests might have different preferences or dietary needs. But the couple isn't banning meat, they're just not serving it. If they're providing vegetarian options, maybe they can also offer non-meat alternatives that meet others' needs. But the question is if they are wrong. The key here is that it's their wedding, and they have the right to make such decisions unless there's a cultural or religious expectation to include meat. But the scenario doesn't mention any such constraints. They also say they don't comment on others eating meat outside the wedding, so they aren't being judgmental. \n\nAnother angle: weddings can be stressful, and having a menu that suits the couple is important for their comfort. They might be avoiding the stress of handling meat smells or sights which they find unpleasant. It's a personal choice, and they are not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they can bring their own food if necessary, though usually guests just eat what's served. However, in many cases, couples do offer a mix of options, but it's not a requirement. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally considered acceptable for a couple to have a vegetarian wedding if that's their choice. They aren't harming others by not serving meat, as long as they provide adequate alternatives. Unless the wedding is in a cultural context where serving meat is customary, but the question doesn't specify that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). It's their event, and they have the right to choose the menu that suits their lifestyle and comfort, especially when both partners agree on it.\n"
