      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author and their partner are strict vegetarians and want their wedding to have only vegetarian meals to avoid the smell or look of meat, even though they don't mind others eating meat. The question is if the author is in the wrong for not offering meat options at their own wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the AITA context. Typically, these posts are on forums where people seek opinions on whether their actions are considered inconsiderate or problematic. The key here is the authors' reasoning. They're not imposing their views on others but rather making a personal choice for their event. But some might argue that guests might want meat, so not offering it could be inconvenient.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. The user wants a simple A or B answer. Let's break it down.\n\nThe authors are strict vegetarians. They don't want meat at their wedding. They don't object to others eating meat in general but prefer their own event to be meat-free. They don't comment on others' eating habits but want their day to reflect their preferences. \n\nIs it wrong to have a vegetarian-only wedding? Well, the wedding is their event, so they have the right to set the menu as they see fit. However, some guests might prefer meat, so the authors might be considered inconsiderate by not offering meat options. But others might argue that guests can bring their own food or that they should have communicated earlier if they had dietary preferences. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often considers factors like intention, communication, and whether the action is within the person's rights. The authors aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. They can't be blamed for their own preferences. However, some might feel that not offering meat is restrictive, especially if guests didn't prepare for that. But the authors are being upfront about their choice, so guests should have known. \n\nI think the key point is that the authors are making a personal choice for their event, which they have the right to do. Unless they're causing harm or being discriminatory (which isn't the case here), they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
