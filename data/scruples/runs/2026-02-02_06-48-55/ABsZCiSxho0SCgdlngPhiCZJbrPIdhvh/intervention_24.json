The couple are strict vegetarians and don't want to deal with the smell or sight of meat on their wedding day. They don't have issues with others eating meat in general but want their own event to be vegetarian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Weddings are personal events, so the hosts have the right to make choices about the food. However, there's a social expectation that weddings might have a variety to accommodate different guests. But since both the couple are vegetarian, maybe they have a valid reason based on their personal preferences and comfort. They aren't forcing anyone to eat vegetarian, just providing what they prefer for the reception. \n\nSome might argue that guests might have different dietary needs, but the couple could have informed guests in advance or provided alternatives. However, the question is about whether they are at fault. Since they are the hosts, it's their choice unless they're violating any specific cultural or religious norms. The fact that they are not making a judgment about others eating meat, just their own event, seems respectful. So, I think the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
