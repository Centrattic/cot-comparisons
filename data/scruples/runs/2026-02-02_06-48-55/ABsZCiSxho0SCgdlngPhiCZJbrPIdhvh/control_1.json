      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having a vegetarian-only wedding reception. The couple are strict vegetarians and don't want meat there because they find the smell or look of it gross. They don't mind others eating meat otherwise, just not on their wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the couple versus their guests. Weddings are personal events, so the hosts have a lot of say in how they want it. If they're vegetarian and don't want meat served, that's their choice. They're not forcing anyone to eat a certain way, just not providing meat options. \n\nBut wait, some guests might have dietary restrictions or preferences that aren't vegetarian. The couple should ensure there are enough vegetarian options that cater to different tastes, maybe including various types of vegetarian dishes. Also, maybe some guests are vegan or have allergies. The key here is that the couple isn't excluding anyone based on their dietary choices but are making a personal choice for their own event.\n\nThere's a difference between not serving meat and being judgmental. The couple says they don't comment on others eating meat, so their stance isn't about judging others but about their own comfort. On their special day, they have the right to set the menu according to their preferences. However, they should make sure the vegetarian menu is diverse and appealing to all guests to avoid any issues. If the menu is thoughtfully planned with variety, then it's not the couple's fault. If they're only serving one or two options, maybe that's a problem. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nAlso, considering cultural or religious factors where meat might be a traditional part of the wedding, but the couple's choice is based on their own strict vegetarianism. They might have discussed this with their guests beforehand, but maybe not. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not about how they communicated it. \n\nIn general, people have the right to make personal choices about their wedding. Unless there's a specific reason guests would be significantly inconvenienced, the couple isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
