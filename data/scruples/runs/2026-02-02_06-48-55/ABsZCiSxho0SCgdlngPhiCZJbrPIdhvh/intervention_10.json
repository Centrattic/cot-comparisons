      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for only serving vegetarian meals at their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: both the author and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't mind others eating meat in general but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but for their wedding, they want no meat options. The question is whether they're in the wrong by doing that.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me consider arguments for both sides. On one hand, a wedding is a celebration that often includes a variety of guests. Some guests might be non-vegetarian or have dietary restrictions that aren't vegetarian. By only serving vegetarian meals, they might be excluding those guests or forcing them to have something they don't want. It could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the guests weren't informed beforehand.\n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is the couple's event. They have the right to choose how they want their day to be. Since they're both vegetarian and it's their preference, it's their choice. The key here is whether they communicated this to their guests. If they did, maybe guests can prepare. But if they didn't, some might be caught off guard. However, the couple isn't forcing anyone to attend, so guests can choose to come regardless of the menu.\n\nAlso, the couple isn't opposing meat-eating in general. They just don't want to deal with it on their day. It's about their comfort. Weddings are personal, so their preferences should be respected unless it's causing harm. But is it causing harm? Maybe some guests might feel their preferences are ignored, but the couple isn't the ones who need to compromise here if it's their event.\n\nAnother angle: dietary restrictions can be more than just preference. Some people have allergies or religious reasons. If the couple is only vegetarian and not accommodating other restrictions, that might be an issue. But the scenario mentions they have no problems with others eating meat, just not wanting it at their wedding. So maybe other options like vegan or gluten-free are considered, but the question is specifically about meat.\n\nIn many weddings, they have a main menu and some alternatives. But the couple has the right to decide their menu. If they choose vegetarian, that's their choice. They might even offer a variety of vegetarian dishes to cater to different tastes. The problem would be if they don't offer enough variety, but the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B. The couple isn't in the wrong because it's their wedding and they can make the choices they want. They should communicate their menu choice to guests in advance, but the decision itself is their right. The key is that they aren't forcing others to eat meat or make choices against their beliefs; they're just choosing their own preferences for their special day.\n"
