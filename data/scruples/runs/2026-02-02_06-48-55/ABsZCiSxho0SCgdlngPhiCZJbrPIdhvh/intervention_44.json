      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote an AITA post is in the wrong for serving only vegetarian meals at their wedding. Both the person and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have a problem with others eating meat, but they find the smell or look of it gross. The wedding reception will have no meat options. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is vegetarian and wants their wedding to reflect their dietary preferences. They aren't eating meat, and they find the presence of meat unpleasant. They don't comment on others eating meat but want their own event to be meat-free. \n\nNext, I should think about the guests. Do they have the right to expect meat at a wedding? Well, weddings are personal events, and the hosts can choose the menu based on their preferences. However, it's important to consider if guests with dietary restrictions (like needing meat) might be inconvenienced. But the couple's own preferences are valid too. \n\nAre they being inconsiderate? Maybe, if they don't offer alternatives. But they are providing vegetarian meals. If they have guests who can't eat vegetarian, that's a problem. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not serving meat. \n\nThe couple's right to have a vegetarian wedding is a personal choice. They are not forcing others to eat vegetarian, just not serving meat. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their community to serve meat, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether choosing a vegetarian menu is reasonable. Since they're both vegetarians and it's their wedding, it's their choice. The guests can choose to eat the vegetarian options or bring their own, but the hosts aren't obligated to provide meat unless they know specific guests need it. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make their event reflect their lifestyle. The answer should be B (No).\n"
