      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a vegetarian-only wedding is in the wrong. The scenario is that both they and their partner are strict vegetarians. They don't have an issue with others eating meat generally but find the smell or look of it gross. They don't comment on others eating meat around them, but on their wedding day, they want no meat options. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices about their own celebration. Since they're both vegetarians, it's their right to choose the menu that aligns with their dietary preferences and values. They're not forcing guests to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. The key point is that they're not imposing their choice on others but creating a space that suits them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that guests might expect some meat options, especially if they have dietary preferences that differ. But the couple isn't banning meat-eaters from attending; they're just curating their own event. Also, the couple mentions they don't comment on others eating meat, so they're not being judgmental. The main issue is about their own comfort on their special day. \n\nIn most cases, people plan weddings according to their cultural, religious, or personal preferences without being judged. For example, some weddings have specific cuisines or dietary restrictions. The couple's choice here is similar. They\u2019re within their rights to make this decision. Unless there's a cultural expectation in their community that requires meat, which isn't mentioned here, they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re making a personal choice for their own event without forcing others to conform. Guests who can't handle vegetarian meals might bring their own, but that's usually acceptable. The couple's reasoning is respectful and doesn't infringe on others' rights beyond their own event's choices.\n"
