Both they and their partner are strict vegetarians and find the smell or look of meat gross, though they don't comment on others eating it. They want their wedding day to avoid meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are personal events where the couple can make choices based on their preferences. Since they're both vegetarian and have their reasons, it's their right to choose the menu. However, they should also consider guests' dietary needs. If they don't offer meat, some guests might not have what they want. But maybe offering vegetarian options only isn't inherently wrong if they communicate it in advance. The couple isn't forcing others to eat vegetarian; they're just not serving meat. They also don't seem to be judgmental about others' choices, which is respectful. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to prioritize their comfort over some guests' preferences. However, weddings are the couple's day, so they have the right to set their own rules. The answer is likely B.\n"
