She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The story goes that they've been hanging out a lot, both seemed to have mutual feelings, but then the girl has a boyfriend who looks similar. The author felt rejected and continued to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval. A friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the key issue is that the girl is in a relationship. Even if the author and the girl were developing feelings, once it's established she's with someone else, the author's actions could be problematic. The author mentions continuing to pursue her after knowing about the boyfriend, which might be seen as crossing a boundary. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is inappropriate or potentially harassing. The author's belief that there's hope might be wishful thinking if the girl isn't interested in ending her current relationship. The boyfriend's discomfort adds another layer, indicating possible jealousy or tension, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. Overall, the author's persistence in pursuing a relationship with someone who's already committed is likely wrong, hence the answer A.\n"
