She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and the author felt they were moving towards a relationship. Then they found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. Now, the author is still continuing to spend time with her, even though the boyfriend is uncomfortable. A friend called the author creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so the author's actions could be seen as pursuing someone who's not available. The author thought there was mutual interest, but since the girl is with someone else, maybe they didn't realize she wasn't single. However, the author continued to pursue her after knowing about the boyfriend. The friend's reaction suggests that the behavior is socially inappropriate.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is whether it's acceptable to pursue someone who is in a relationship. Generally, relationships are exclusive, so pursuing a partner's significant other is considered wrong. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest, the girl is already in a committed relationship, so the author's actions cross a boundary. The author's persistence despite the boyfriend's discomfort and the friend's warning indicates that they're not respecting the girl's relationship status. Even if the author claims they're maintaining a friendship, continuing to engage in a way that might cause emotional harm or conflict is problematic. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
