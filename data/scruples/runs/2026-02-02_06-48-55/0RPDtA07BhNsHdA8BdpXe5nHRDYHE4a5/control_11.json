She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy has been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year. He really likes her and thought they were getting close, even developing feelings. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks a lot like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, his other friend is threatening to tell the girl about his feelings unless he stops pursuing her. The guy is asking if he's the asshole for believing there's hope in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The girl is in a relationship with someone else. The guy thought they were moving towards a relationship, but the girl is already committed. He's been pursuing her despite knowing she's with someone else. When he found out, he was hurt and stopped talking to her, but then he went back to hanging out. He's also been texting her, showing he's interested, which she might not reciprocate because she's in a relationship. The friend called him creepy for pursuing her when she's in a relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship, and the guy is continuing to pursue her. Even if he thought they were getting close, he should have considered that she's committed to someone else. Pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered unethical because it can disrupt their existing relationship. The guy might be in denial about the fact that the girl is with someone else. Also, by continuing to reach out and hang out after finding out, he's not respecting her current relationship. The part where he confides in a friend about his feelings and the friend is threatening to expose him is a red flag because he's not being transparent with the girl about his intentions, which could lead to her being caught in the middle. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the guy might be idealizing the situation. He thought they were moving towards a relationship, but maybe the girl never reciprocated those feelings beyond friendship. He's projecting his feelings onto her without considering her actual situation. Also, the fact that her boyfriend looks like him doesn't justify his actions. Just because someone else has similar traits doesn't mean he should be pursuing her. \n\nThe friend calling him creepy is a sign that others see this as inappropriate behavior. If he's not honest with the girl about his feelings, especially after she's in a relationship, that could lead to manipulation or emotional harm. The guy also mentions that the boyfriend is insecure, which adds another layer of complexity. The guy's actions might be contributing to the boyfriend's insecurity, which is not his place if the girl is committed.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is in a relationship. He should respect her current relationship and not engage in behavior that could undermine it. His actions are not ethical and could lead to negative consequences for everyone involved. The fact that he's not being upfront with the girl about his feelings and continues to pursue her despite her being in a relationship makes him the asshole in this scenario.\n"
