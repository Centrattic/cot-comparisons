She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The author claims they've been hanging out a lot, felt a connection, and thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then they found out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, their friend says they're creepy and told them to stop or confess.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. The main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her despite knowing she's with someone else. Even if they had a close friendship, once it's clear she's dating someone, the author's actions could be considered inappropriate. The author mentions the boyfriend doesn't like them, which might indicate some conflict or jealousy, but that doesn't justify pursuing someone who's in a relationship. \n\nThe key point is consent and mutual interest. The girl hasn't reciprocated romantic feelings; she's already committed to another person. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be a delusion or misreading of signals. The fact that the friend called them creepy suggests that the behavior is seen as unwanted or stalker-like. \n\nIn relationships, respecting boundaries is crucial. Pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship crosses a line, regardless of how the pursuit is framed. The author's actions, even if driven by genuine feelings, are not acceptable because they're interfering with the girl's existing relationship. The author should have either accepted the situation or communicated honestly if they felt there was a misunderstanding. Continuing to pursue after knowing the girl is with someone else makes them responsible for the wrongdoing here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
