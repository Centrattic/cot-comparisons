She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post, so the context is clear.\n\nFirst, the author has been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and someone they really enjoy being around. The girl also texts them to hang out and compliments them. The author feels like there's mutual attraction and a budding relationship. Then, the author finds out the girl is dating someone else who looks like them. They get hurt, stop talking for a few days, then reach out again, ignoring the boyfriend's disapproval. The friend labels the author as creepy if they don't stop, leading to the question of whether the author is the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is already in a relationship, the author was aware of this after discovering it, and continued to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval. The author's friend is concerned enough to call them creepy and threaten to expose their feelings.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethical standards, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered inappropriate. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest before knowing about the boyfriend, continuing after that knowledge is problematic. The author's actions might give mixed signals to the girl, as they're maintaining a close friendship while ignoring the boyfriend's discomfort. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is crossing into unwelcome territory.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl's boyfriend looks similar to them, implying that maybe the girl chose the other guy for superficial reasons. However, that doesn't justify the author's actions. The fact remains that the girl is in a committed relationship, and the author's pursuit could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a societal perspective, yes, because they're knowingly pursuing someone who is already taken, which can be seen as disrespectful to the existing relationship. Even if the author believes there's potential, the right approach would be to step back and respect the girl's current situation. The author's continued interaction, especially after being told to stop by a friend, likely makes them the asshole in this scenario.\n"
