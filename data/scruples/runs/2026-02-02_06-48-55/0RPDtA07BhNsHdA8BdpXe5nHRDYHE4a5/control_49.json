She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The writer met the girl at the start of the school year, they became close friends, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, but then tried to continue being friends. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether pursuing a girl who is in a relationship is wrong. The writer's actions include continuing to hang out with her after knowing she's with someone else. The ex-friend's reaction suggests that the writer's behavior is inappropriate. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, most people consider it wrong to pursue someone who is already in a relationship. The girl is with another person, and the writer is trying to develop a romantic relationship with her despite that. Even though the writer claims to value their friendship, the fact that he's still pursuing her romantically while she's in a committed relationship is problematic. The boyfriend's disapproval and the friend's accusation of being creepy add to the concern that the writer's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable and potentially interfering with the existing relationship.\n\nThe writer mentions that the girl told him how much she loved spending time with him, which might have led him to believe there was mutual romantic interest. However, she's already in a relationship, so even if she felt that way, it's not appropriate to act on it without ending the current relationship. The writer's continued pursuit could be seen as encouraging an affair or causing emotional distress to both the girl and her boyfriend.\n\nAdditionally, the writer's friend's reaction is a red flag. If someone else perceives his behavior as creepy, that's a sign something's wrong. The writer might be in denial about the inappropriateness of his actions. The fact that he reached out again after the initial shock shows he's not respecting the girl's current relationship status.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer is likely in the wrong because pursuing a girl who is in a relationship goes against social norms and ethical standards. It's important to respect people's relationships and not interfere. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
