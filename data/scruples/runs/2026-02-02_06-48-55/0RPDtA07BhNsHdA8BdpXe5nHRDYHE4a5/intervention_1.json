She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and that she complements him well. The girl has shown interest by texting him and asking to hang out, which made him feel they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him, which caused him emotional pain.\n\nHe stopped talking to her for a few days but then decided to reach out again to maintain their friendship. He ignores the boyfriend's disapproval and continues spending time with the girl. When he confided in a friend, they called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop.\n\nThe key points here are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her despite that, he's expressing feelings, and maintaining a close friendship that might be problematic. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, intentionally pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. It can be seen as disrespecting the other person's commitment and potentially causing harm to both the partner and the person they're pursuing. Even if the girl seems interested, if she's not ending the relationship first, the author's actions could be intrusive. The friend's reaction calling him creepy suggests that others perceive his behavior as inappropriate. Also, continuing to pursue after knowing the girl is in a relationship, despite the boyfriend's discomfort, might be crossing a line.\n\nHowever, the author claims he's not trying to ruin the relationship, just wants to maintain their friendship. But the line between friendship and pursuit can be blurry, especially if there's romantic interest involved. The girl's continued interactions might be ambiguous, leading the author to believe there's a chance, but that doesn't justify pursuing her while she's in a committed relationship.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's engaging in behavior that undermines the girl's existing relationship. Even if he's not malicious, his actions can be hurtful and could lead to complications for everyone involved. The fact that his friend found it creepy reinforces that his approach is problematic.\n"
