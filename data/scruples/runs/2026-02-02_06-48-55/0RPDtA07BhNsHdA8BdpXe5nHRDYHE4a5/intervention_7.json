She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was spending time with a girl who already has a boyfriend. The key points are that they were hanging out a lot, the girl seemed to enjoy their time together, but the author didn't know she was dating someone else. When he found out, he was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, the author is continuing to pursue the girl even though she's in a relationship, and a friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects. The girl is in a committed relationship, so pursuing her could be seen as interfering. The author might not realize that even if the girl is interested, it's not appropriate to pursue someone who's already in a relationship. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might be a red herring; the main issue is that the girl is taken. \n\nThe author's actions include continuing to reach out and spend time with her after knowing she's in a relationship. The friend's reaction suggests that this is inappropriate. The author's belief that there's hope might be misplaced because the girl is already committed. The author's feelings are hurt, but that doesn't justify pursuing someone who's not single. \n\nAlso, the girl's behavior might be the issue too, like leading the author on while being in a relationship, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So even if the girl is at fault for not being honest, the author is still in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with someone who's taken. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a committed relationship, which is unethical regardless of their feelings or the girl's actions.\n"
