She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. From the story, they've been hanging out a lot since the school year started, and they felt like they were getting close to a relationship. Then they found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to them. They were hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now her friend is threatening to tell the girl about their feelings if they don't stop.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the girl is in a relationship. The person is continuing to pursue her despite that. Even if they thought there was mutual attraction or budding feelings, once you know they're in a relationship, pursuing them is problematic. The fact that they're still hanging out and the boyfriend is uncomfortable adds to the situation.\n\nThe user might be justifying their actions by saying they love the friendship and want to continue, but the key point is that the girl is already committed. The friend's reaction also suggests that the user's behavior is seen as inappropriate. Even if they felt they were moving towards a relationship before, once the relationship exists, continuing to pursue is generally considered wrong. So the answer is likely A, they are in the wrong.\n"
