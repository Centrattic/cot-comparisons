She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there might be a romantic connection, but then found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking to her, then reached out again. Now, a friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl has a boyfriend, so any romantic pursuit of her by someone else is generally considered wrong. The author thought there was a mutual connection, but the girl chose to date someone else. The author then continued to pursue her despite the boyfriend being around and showing disapproval. \n\nFriendship with someone who is in a relationship can be tricky. Even if the girl seems to enjoy the author's company, continuing to pursue her romantically when she's already in a relationship is crossing a boundary. The author's friend pointed out it's creepy, which is a red flag. Also, the author's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which isn't fair to either of them.\n\nThe author might argue that the girl was leading them on, but the responsibility is on the author to recognize that she's in a relationship and not to pursue her. The line between friendship and pursuit is important here. Even if there's mutual feelings, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is typically seen as wrong because it can disrupt their current relationship and cause harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
