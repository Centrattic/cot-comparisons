She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer has been spending a lot of time with a girl who already has a boyfriend. They felt like there was a budding relationship, but then found out about her boyfriend who looks similar to them. The writer got hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. They're still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, and another friend called them creepy for it.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The writer admits they knew she had a boyfriend but kept pursuing her. Even though they were friends before she started dating the other guy, once it's established she's in a relationship, pursuing her could be seen as interfering. The fact that her boyfriend looks similar doesn't justify the pursuit. The writer's actions might be considered as trying to replace the boyfriend, which is problematic.\n\nThen there's the part where the writer confesses their feelings to a friend, who then threatens to tell the girl. The writer is still continuing to pursue, which could be crossing boundaries. The friend called them creepy, implying that their actions are inappropriate. The writer thinks there's \"hope\" even though the girl is in a committed relationship. That's a red flag because pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally not acceptable and can be seen as disrespectful to both the partner and the person in the relationship.\n\nThe writer's justification is that they value their friendship and the time spent together, but maintaining a friendship while having romantic feelings, especially when the friend is in a relationship, can lead to complications. The writer's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which they acknowledge. The key point here is whether the writer should have recognized that the girl is in a relationship and respected that boundary, rather than continuing to pursue her.\n\nSo putting it all together, the writer is in the wrong because they're pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate. Even if there was a prior friendship, the existence of a boyfriend changes the dynamics, and the writer should have respected that. The friend labeling them as creepy supports the idea that their actions are inappropriate. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
