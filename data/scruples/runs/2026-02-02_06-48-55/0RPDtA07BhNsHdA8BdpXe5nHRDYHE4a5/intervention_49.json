She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. From the details, they were hanging out a lot, both seemed happy, and the author thought there was a possibility of a relationship. But then they found out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, they continue to hang out despite the boyfriend's disapproval and a friend called them creepy for pursuing this.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. Even if the author thought there was a mutual connection, once they knew she was dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The key point is that the girl is not single, so any romantic pursuit from the author would be interfering in her existing relationship. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries. Even if the girl is okay with the friendship, the fact that the author is still harboring romantic feelings and pursuing her while she's in a relationship could make the boyfriend uncomfortable and might not be respectful to the girl's current partner. The friend who called them creepy is concerned because the author is showing continued interest despite the girl being in a relationship, which can be viewed as inappropriate or stalker-like behavior, even if it's just hanging out.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl told them how great they were and loved spending time with them. However, if she's in a relationship, expressing such positive feelings might be inappropriate or misleading, and the author might have been led on unintentionally. But regardless, once the author knew about the boyfriend, they should have respected her relationship and not pursued a romantic connection.\n\nThe question is whether pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a committed relationship makes the author the asshole. In most social contexts, yes, because it's interfering in another person's relationship and can be seen as disrespectful. The author might not be malicious, but their actions are still problematic because they're not respecting the girl's current relationship status. Even if they think there's \"hope,\" the girl is not single, so pursuing her is inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer seems to be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which can be considered disrespectful and inappropriate.\n"
