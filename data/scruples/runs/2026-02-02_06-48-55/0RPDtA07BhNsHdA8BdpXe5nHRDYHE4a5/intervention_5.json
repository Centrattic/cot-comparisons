She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation starts with the author and the girl hanging out a lot, building a friendship, and the author thinks they're moving towards a relationship. Then the author finds out she's dating someone who looks similar. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. His friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her even though she's with someone else. Even though he mentions they were close friends and he felt they were moving towards a relationship, once he found out she's dating someone else, that's when the problem arises. \n\nThe key point is whether it's wrong to pursue someone who is already in a relationship. Generally, relationships are about exclusivity, so pursuing a partner of someone else is considered inappropriate. The author's actions post-discovery\u2014that is, continuing to hang out, expressing his feelings, and trying to maintain a close relationship\u2014could be seen as interfering in her current relationship. \n\nThe author also mentions that the boyfriend doesn't like him and might be insecure. That suggests there's tension, and the author might not realize the impact of his actions on the existing relationship. The friend calling him creepy is a red flag here. Even if the author believes there's hope, the girl is already committed, so his pursuit is unethical. \n\nEven if the author had a bond before the relationship, once the girl is in a committed relationship, the boundaries change. It's not just about his feelings but respecting her current partner and her choice. The author might think he and the girl have a connection, but it's not appropriate to pursue a relationship when she's already with someone else. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate and can be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her boyfriend.\n"
