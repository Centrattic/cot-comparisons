She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out since the school year started, and the author felt a connection, even though the girl was with someone else. The key points here are that the girl is in a relationship, the author knew about it, and the author is still pursuing her despite the boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The girl is with someone else, so pursuing her while she's in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as disrespecting her current partner. The author mentions that the boyfriend looks similar to them, which might explain why he's insecure, but that doesn't justify the pursuit. The author also stopped talking to her for a few days but then resumed, which shows they continued the interaction after knowing the girl was dating. The friend's reaction of calling them creepy and threatening to tell the girl suggests that the actions are socially frowned upon. Even if the author believes there's hope, the girl is already in a relationship, so actively pursuing her while she's with someone else is not appropriate. The author's actions might be leading to emotional harm for both the girl and her boyfriend. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
