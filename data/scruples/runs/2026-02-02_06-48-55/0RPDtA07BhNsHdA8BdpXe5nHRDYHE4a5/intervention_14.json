She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the two have been hanging out a lot, and the author feels they're moving towards a relationship. But then the author finds out the girl is dating someone else who looks similar. The author is hurt, stops talking to her briefly, then resumes the friendship. The author is now being called creepy by a friend for continuing to pursue the girl despite her being in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions involve pursuing someone who's not single, which is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as disrespecting the girl's current relationship. Even if the author believes there's a connection, continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who's in a committed partnership is typically frowned upon. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance doesn't justify the pursuit. Additionally, the author's friend points out that the boyfriend is uncomfortable, which suggests that the author's actions might be making the current partner feel threatened. The author's persistence might also be confusing for the girl, as she might feel torn between their friendship and her existing relationship. The friend's warning about being called creepy and the threat to expose the author's feelings indicates that others see this as inappropriate. Even if the author thinks the friendship is important, pursuing a romantic relationship with someone who's not single is ethically problematic. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
