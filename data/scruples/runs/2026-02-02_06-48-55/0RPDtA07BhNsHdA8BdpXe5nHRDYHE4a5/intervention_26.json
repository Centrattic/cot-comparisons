She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about the author pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone who looks like him. He's hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to reconnect. His friend calls him creepy for continuing to pursue her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the girl is in a relationship. The author knew they were friends, but didn't know about the boyfriend initially. Once he finds out, he's still pursuing her despite her being taken. Even if the boyfriend is similar in appearance and maybe insecure, the key issue here is that the girl is already committed. The author is continuing to pursue her after knowing this, which can be seen as respecting her current relationship or as being persistent in a way that's not appropriate.\n\nThe author mentions that he thinks there's hope and he loves their friendship and time together. But if the girl is in a relationship, pursuing her romantically could be interfering with her current relationship. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions might be crossing a line, especially if he's confessing his feelings and continuing to engage in a way that makes others uncomfortable.\n\nEven if the girl was leading him on or showing interest before the relationship was known, once the author found out she's with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be considered wrong. The author's belief in \"hope\" might not be valid if the girl isn't considering ending her current relationship. So, the author's actions are likely in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who's already in a relationship, regardless of the circumstances. The answer should be A.\n"
