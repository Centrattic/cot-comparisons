She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The author mentions that they were hanging out with her since the school year started, felt they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone who looks a lot like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconcile the friendship. His friend accused him of being creepy and threatening to tell the girl if he doesn't stop. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is that the girl has a boyfriend. The author is continuing to pursue her despite that. The author thought there was a mutual connection, but the girl was already in a relationship. The author's actions post-discovery include trying to maintain contact, maybe even ignoring the boyfriend's disapproval. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is inappropriate.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer (A or B). So, according to the analysis: the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate. Even if they had a close friendship, continuing to pursue her after knowing about the boyfriend makes him the asshole. The fact that he was hurt and tried to continue the friendship might be understandable, but it's still wrong to pursue someone who's taken. The friend calling him creepy supports that. So the answer is A.\n"
