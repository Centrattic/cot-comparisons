She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since school started, and the author felt like they were getting close. The author thought there was a chance for a relationship, but then found out the girl is dating someone who looks similar to him. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, the author is continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship, and a friend called them creepy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who is committed. The author thought there was a possibility they might be together, but the girl made a choice with someone else. Even if the author believed there was a mutual connection, once it's established the girl is in a relationship, continuing to pursue her could be seen as inappropriate. The author's actions might be infringing on the girl's current relationship, which is generally considered wrong. Also, the boyfriend's disapproval might be a sign that the girl's relationship is active and she's not looking for anything else. The friend's warning adds another layer, implying that the author's pursuit is making others uncomfortable and could lead to the girl being put in a difficult position if she finds out. Even if the author feels there's hope, respecting boundaries in relationships is crucial. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
