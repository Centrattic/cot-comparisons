She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that the girl and the author had been hanging out a lot, and he felt they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone who looks like him. He stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again, and now her boyfriend is upset. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author is pursuing her despite knowing this. Even if the girl seemed to like him, she's committed to someone else. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship, which is generally frowned upon. The fact that he confessed his feelings to a friend who then warned him adds another layer\u2014maybe the friend felt he was being too forward or persistent.\n\nThe author mentions that he stopped talking for a few days but then resumed the friendship. However, maintaining a close relationship with someone who is in a committed relationship can lead to complications, even if both parties are just being friends. The boyfriend's discomfort makes sense because of the close proximity and potential for jealousy. \n\nEven if the author believes there's hope, pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a monogamous relationship is ethically questionable. The girl's actions might also be a factor\u2014if she's leading the author on while being with someone else, that's her responsibility, but the author is equally at fault for not respecting her current relationship. \n\nThe line between friendship and pursuing a romantic interest can be blurry, but once someone is in a relationship, the ethical approach is usually to step back. The author's persistence could be seen as crossing that line, making him the asshole in this situation. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
