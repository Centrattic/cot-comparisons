She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The user wants the answer to be either A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no). I need to figure out which one is correct based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The person has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, etc., and they felt a connection. The girl texted them to hang out, and they thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then they found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The person was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. They continue to hang out despite the boyfriend's disapproval. A friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they don't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl is in a relationship with someone else. The person in the post is continuing to pursue her, even after knowing she's in a relationship. They didn't consider that the girl might not be interested in them romantically, even if she's been friendly. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance doesn't justify their actions. The person is ignoring the reality that she's with someone else, which is a clear boundary. The friend's reaction suggests that the person's behavior is crossing into inappropriate territory, which is a red flag.\n\nThe main issue here is pursuing someone who is already in a relationship. Even if there was mutual friendship or attraction, if she's in a committed relationship, the right thing would be to step back and respect that. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be based on their own feelings and misinterpretations of the girl's signals. The girl's actions (hanging out, texting) might have been platonic or based on friendship, not reciprocated romantic feelings. The author's continued pursuit despite the boyfriend's presence and the friend's warning indicates they're in the wrong. They're not respecting the existing relationship and are potentially being a third wheel, which can be uncomfortable and unethical.\n"
