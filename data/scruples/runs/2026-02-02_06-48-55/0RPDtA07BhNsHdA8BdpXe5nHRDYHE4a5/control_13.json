She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand better.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out since the school year started, and they felt like they were moving towards a relationship. The girl texted them to hang out, and they thought there was mutual interest. Then they found out the girl is dating someone who looks similar to them. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again to continue the friendship. The boyfriend doesn't like them, and a friend called them creepy, threatening to tell the girl if they don't stop or come clean. The author is wondering if they're wrong for still believing there's hope.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girl is in a relationship, so pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is usually considered wrong. The author thought they were building a relationship with her, but she chose to be with someone else. The author is continuing to pursue the friendship and express feelings, which could be problematic because the girl is with someone else. The friend's reaction suggests that this behavior might be crossing a line.\n\nThe author's actions might be problematic because they're pursuing someone who is in a relationship. Even if they thought there was mutual interest, once they knew she was dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be seen as unethical. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar doesn't change the fact that she's committed to him. The author's friend's reaction (calling them creepy) supports the idea that this behavior isn't appropriate. The author might be in denial about the situation, thinking there's still hope when the girl has already chosen a partner.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of their feelings. The author needs to respect the girl's current relationship and stop pursuing her to avoid causing further harm.\n"
