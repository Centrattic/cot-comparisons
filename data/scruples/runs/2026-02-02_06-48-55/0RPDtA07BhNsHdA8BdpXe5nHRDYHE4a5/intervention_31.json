She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there was potential for a relationship. But then it's revealed she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her briefly, then tried to reconnect, but the friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions of \"pursuing\" her could be problematic because she's not single. Even if they were just friends, the author's feelings might be innocent, but actively pursuing a relationship with someone who's taken is generally considered wrong. The author mentions feeling \"love\" and continuing to hang out despite her being in a relationship. That could be seen as crossing boundaries.\n\nThe author stopped talking to her for a few days when he found out, which is understandable as a reaction. But then he reached out again, which shows he's still interested. The part where he says he \"loves our relationship and the time we spend together\" while she's with someone else is concerning. It might not be physically romantic, but emotionally pursuing someone who's in a relationship is typically frowned upon. \n\nThe friend's reaction of calling him creepy makes sense if the author is continuing to pursue her in a way that's intrusive or shows disregard for her relationship. The author also mentions the boyfriend doesn't like him, which could indicate that the author's actions are making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which isn't fair.\n\nSo even if the girl felt some connection, the author should have respected her relationship status. The line between friendship and pursuing a relationship is crossed here. The fact that the author is trying to maintain a close relationship with someone who's in a relationship makes him the asshole because he's not respecting her current commitments. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
