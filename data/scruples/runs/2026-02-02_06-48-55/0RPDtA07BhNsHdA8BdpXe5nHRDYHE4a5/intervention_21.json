She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They thought they were moving towards a relationship because she was nice, they connected, and she seemed to like spending time with him. Then he found out she's in a relationship with someone who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now his friend is calling him creepy if he doesn't confess or stop. The question is whether he's the asshole for believing there's hope.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so she's with someone else. The author was under the impression that there was something brewing between them, but that's not the case. The main issue here is pursuing someone who is already in a relationship. Even if the girl was leading him on, the author continued to pursue her after finding out she's dating someone else. That's a red flag. \n\nEven if the author thought they were moving towards a relationship, once he found out she's in a relationship, he should have respected her current relationship. The fact that he continued to reach out and maintain the friendship despite knowing she's with someone else is problematic. The friend warning him is valid because pursuing a relationship with someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that the guy she's with might be insecure is not a justification. The key point is that the girl is in a relationship, so the author shouldn't be trying to develop a relationship with her. The fact that he's still in love and wants to believe there's hope shows that he's not respecting her current commitments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which is considered inappropriate. The answer would be A.\n"
