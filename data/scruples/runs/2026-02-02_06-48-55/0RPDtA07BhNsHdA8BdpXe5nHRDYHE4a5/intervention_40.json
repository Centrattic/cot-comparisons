She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The key points here are the fact that the girl is in a relationship and the author is continuing to pursue her despite that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The girl is with someone else, so the author's actions could be seen as interfering in an existing relationship. Even if the girl was leading the author on, that doesn't necessarily justify the pursuit. The fact that the girl's boyfriend looks similar to the author might be a factor, but that doesn't change the fact that the author is aware of the relationship and still chooses to pursue her. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days but then resumed hanging out. The other friend even called the author creepy, which adds another layer. The friend's reaction suggests that the behavior is socially inappropriate. The author's insistence on maintaining the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval could be seen as crossing boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The general societal expectation is that one should not pursue someone who is in a committed relationship. Even if there were signs of mutual interest, once it's known that the person is taken, continuing to pursue them would be considered inappropriate. The author's actions might be damaging to the existing relationship and could be seen as manipulative or deceitful, especially if the girl was aware of the author's feelings but chose to stay with her boyfriend.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they are engaging in behavior that is not respectful towards the girl's current relationship and could be hurting all parties involved.\n"
