She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. From the situation described, the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and the author thought there was a budding relationship. However, it turns out she's dating someone who looks like him. The author is hurt and continued to pursue her even after knowing she's in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is already in a committed relationship. Even if the author felt there was a connection, once he found out about her boyfriend, continuing to pursue her could be seen as inappropriate. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure about the author doesn't justify his actions. Pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can harm the existing relationship and is disloyal to the boyfriend. \n\nThe author's friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her, which adds another layer. Even if the author believes there's hope, the reality is that the girl is not single. The author's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if he's still trying to build a relationship with someone who is not available. \n\nAlso, the author's feelings are valid, but the way he's handling them by not respecting her committed status is where the problem lies. The idea that he deserves a chance because of their time together doesn't hold up when someone is in a relationship. So, yeah, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
