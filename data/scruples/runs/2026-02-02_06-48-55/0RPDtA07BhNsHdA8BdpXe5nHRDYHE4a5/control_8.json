She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author and this girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. They seem to have a good time together, and the author really likes her. The girl also seems to reciprocate some feelings, saying good things about him and wanting to spend time with him. The author feels like they're moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar\u2014same race, build, etc. That guy is in their dorm. The author is hurt and stops talking to her for a few days. Then he reaches out again, wanting to continue their friendship. The guy's boyfriend doesn't like him, and another friend threatens to tell the girl if the author doesn't stop. Now he's asking if he's the asshole for believing there's hope.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The key question is whether the author is acting inappropriately by continuing to pursue her despite her being in a committed relationship. The author mentions that he loves her and their friendship, but he's not considering her current relationship status. The girl's boyfriend is uncomfortable with the author's presence, which adds another layer of tension. Also, the friend calls the author creepy, which might indicate that his actions are crossing boundaries.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as disrespecting the other person's commitment. Even if the author and the girl were close friends and had mutual feelings, once it's known that she's in a relationship, continuing to pursue her could be seen as interfering in her existing relationship. The fact that the author is trying to maintain a friendship while having romantic feelings might be complicating things. The other friend's warning suggests that his actions are not just personal but could affect others negatively.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the girl didn't make her relationship status clear initially. But once he found out, the appropriate response would be to step back and respect her relationship. Continuing to pursue her after knowing could be seen as manipulative or insincere, especially if he's trying to maintain a friendship that could lead to something more. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable also shows that the author's actions are causing issues for others.\n\nAnother angle is the girl's perspective. If she's in a relationship, she might not be open to pursuing a relationship with the author. The author's belief that there's hope might be based on his own feelings rather than the reality of her current situation. It's possible that the girl's affectionate behavior was just friendly, and she never intended to be in a relationship with him. The author might be misinterpreting the signals she gave, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be considered wrong because he's pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which is generally frowned upon. Even if he's trying to maintain a friendship, his continued pursuit might be seen as inappropriate. The friend's reaction and the boyfriend's discomfort support the idea that the author is overstepping boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
