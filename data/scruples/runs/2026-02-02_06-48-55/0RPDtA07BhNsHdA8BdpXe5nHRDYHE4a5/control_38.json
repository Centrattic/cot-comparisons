She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, and the author felt they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone who looks like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect, but the boyfriend doesn't like him. A friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions involve pursuing her despite her being in a committed relationship. Even if the guy feels there was mutual interest before, once it's clear she's dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance might add to the author's confusion, but that doesn't excuse the pursuit of someone who's in a relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that they were hanging out a lot and felt a connection, but once the relationship was known, it's his responsibility to respect her committed status. The friend calling him creepy and threatening to reveal his feelings suggests that his actions might be overstepping boundaries. Even if he claims to be trying to maintain a friendship, the continued pursuit and expressing feelings could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who's already dating someone else. The fact that the girl might have been leading him on or not clear about her intentions doesn't absolve him from respecting her relationship. The main issue is that he's not respecting her current relationship, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
