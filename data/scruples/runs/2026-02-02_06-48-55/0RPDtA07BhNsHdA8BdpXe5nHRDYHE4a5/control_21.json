She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's been spending a lot of time with a girl who has a boyfriend. The key points here are:\n\nFirst, the girl is already in a relationship. The writer mentions that she has a boyfriend who looks similar to him. He wasn't aware of this initially and thought they were building something, but it's clear she's in a committed relationship. The writer then starts to pursue her, which likely means continuing to spend time with her and maybe expressing feelings, even after knowing she's dating someone else.\n\nThe writer claims they love their friendship and the time they spend together, but if the girl is in a relationship, the boyfriend might feel that the writer is encroaching on their space. The writer's friend calls them creepy and threatens to reveal his feelings if he doesn't stop. This suggests that the writer's actions might be making others uncomfortable, especially the boyfriend, which could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nAnother point is the writer's own confusion about why the girl chose her boyfriend over him. He's hurt and feels rejected, but the fact remains that she's in a relationship. Pursuing someone who's already in a relationship can be seen as unethical because it can cause harm to all parties involved. The writer might be violating the boundaries set by the girl's existing relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. From a general perspective, pursuing a girl who's in a relationship is typically considered wrong because it's not respecting her current commitment. Even if the writer believes there's \"hope,\" continuing to pursue could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure about the writer adds to the tension, indicating that the writer's actions might be affecting the existing relationship negatively.\n\nThe writer's justification is that they love their friendship and the time together, but if the girl is in a relationship, the writer should probably back off to avoid complicating things. The friend's reaction also highlights that the writer's behavior is crossing a line, as they're being called creepy. This suggests that the writer is indeed overstepping, making them the asshole in the situation.\n"
