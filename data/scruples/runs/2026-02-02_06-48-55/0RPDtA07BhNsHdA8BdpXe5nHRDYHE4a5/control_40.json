She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started, thinking there's a romantic connection. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks just like him. He gets hurt and stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. His friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl about his feelings if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl already has a boyfriend. The author was pursuing her, thinking they were moving towards a relationship, but she's already committed to someone else. The author's actions after finding out include continuing to pursue her, even though she's in a relationship. The friend's reaction is that he's being creepy and needs to stop.\n\nFirst, the author is clearly aware that the girl is dating someone else. He's continuing to hang out with her and even mentions loving her and their friendship. But since she's in a relationship, pursuing her romantically is problematic. The fact that he's trying to continue the relationship despite her boyfriend's existence is a red flag. Also, his friend's warning suggests that his actions could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nThe author might justify it by saying they have a strong friendship and they both enjoy spending time together, but the girl is already in a committed relationship. Even if there were mutual feelings, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's not reciprocal and can cause harm to both the person and their partner.\n\nAdditionally, the guy's insecurity about the boyfriend not liking him might be a sign that he's being threatened, but that doesn't justify his actions. The main issue is that he's pursuing someone who's not available. The friend's threat indicates that the author's behavior is crossing boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for continuing to pursue the girl while she's in a relationship. Even if there's a friendship, the romantic pursuit is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
