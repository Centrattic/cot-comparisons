She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They were hanging out a lot, both seemed to have feelings, and then the author found out she's dating someone who looks like him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author kept pursuing her even after knowing she's with someone else. The girl's boyfriend is apparently uncomfortable with the author, and a friend called the author creepy. \n\nThe author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days after finding out, but then resumed hanging out. Even after being told they might be creepy, they still want to continue the relationship. This seems problematic because pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong. It's not fair to the boyfriend and could hurt the girl as well. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: continuing to pursue a girl who's dating someone else, ignoring the boyfriend's discomfort, and the friend's warning. The author's belief that there's hope might be misplaced if the girl has already chosen her partner. The actions described could be seen as disrespecting the girl's current relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They should respect the girl's relationship and not pursue her. Even if there was mutual feelings before, once it's known she's in a relationship, continuing to pursue is unethical.\n"
