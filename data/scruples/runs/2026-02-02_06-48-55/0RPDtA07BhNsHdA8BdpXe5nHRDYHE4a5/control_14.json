She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot, both seem to have feelings, but she's in a relationship. The guy found out she's dating someone who looks like him, which makes him feel rejected. He stopped talking for a few days but then reached out again, ignoring the boyfriend's disapproval. His friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the girl is already in a relationship. Even if there were mutual feelings or a \"connection,\" pursuing someone who's with someone else is generally considered wrong. It can be emotionally harmful and is often seen as disrespectful to the existing relationship. The guy's actions might be leading to emotional manipulation or creating a love triangle, which is problematic.\n\nHe mentions that he loves her friendship and their time together. But continuing to pursue her when she's in a relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that he's ignoring the boyfriend's insecurity and keeps hanging out despite that adds to the problem. Also, his friend's reaction labeling him as creepy suggests that others see his behavior as inappropriate.\n\nEven if there were mutual feelings, the girl is committed elsewhere. So, the guy's belief that there's \"hope\" might be misplaced. It's possible she doesn't want to end her current relationship, and his persistence could be pushing her into a situation where she's cheating or leading him on, which would be harmful to both parties.\n\nThe key point here is that respecting someone's relationship status is crucial. If both were single and mutual feelings existed, pursuing a relationship would be okay. But since she's in a committed relationship, the guy's actions are ethically questionable. He's not just having a friendship; he's pursuing a romantic interest in someone who isn't available. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
