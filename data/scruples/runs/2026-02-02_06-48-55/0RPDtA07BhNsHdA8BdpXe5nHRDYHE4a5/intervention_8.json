She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The story goes that the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and the author thought there was a chance they might get together. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then resumed the friendship, and now is trying to figure out if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girl has a boyfriend. The author and the girl were spending a lot of time together, but the author didn't realize she was already in a relationship. The author felt there was a budding relationship but didn't ask if she was available. The author then continued to pursue her even after knowing she has a boyfriend, which leads to the friend threatening to tell her about his feelings. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, it's generally considered wrong to pursue someone who is already in a relationship. Even if the author thought there was a mutual connection, the girl's relationship status should have been a red flag. The author didn't confirm her availability and instead continued to pursue her, which can be seen as disrespecting her current relationship. The fact that her boyfriend looks like the author might be an excuse to justify his actions, but it doesn't change the fact that he's pursuing someone in a relationship. \n\nThe author's actions could be perceived as obsessive, especially since he was hurt when she was with someone else, stopped talking to her, then resumed contact. The friend's reaction (calling him creepy) adds another layer, suggesting that the author's behavior is overstepping boundaries. Even if the author believes there's hope, the girl is already committed, so pursuing her is unethical. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is in a relationship, not respecting her current commitments, and possibly being obsessive despite the friend's warnings.\n"
