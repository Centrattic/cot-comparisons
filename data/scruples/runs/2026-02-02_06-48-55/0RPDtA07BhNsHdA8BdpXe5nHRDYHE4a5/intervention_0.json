She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girl and the writer were hanging out a lot, and the writer felt they were moving towards a relationship. The girl is also dating someone who looks like the writer. The writer got hurt when he found out, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect. Now, the writer is continuing to pursue her despite her having a boyfriend, and a friend called him creepy.\n\nThe main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. Even if the writer thought there was mutual interest, the fact remains that she's with someone else. The writer is continuing to pursue her, which can be seen as inappropriate. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might add to the situation, but that doesn't justify the pursuit. \n\nThe writer mentions that he \"loves\" her and wants to maintain their friendship, but pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong. The friend's reaction suggests that the writer's behavior is intrusive or persistent in a way that's not acceptable. \n\nEven if the writer believes there's \"hope,\" it's important to respect the girl's current relationship. Approaching her without acknowledging the boyfriend's existence could be seen as disrespectful. The writer should probably step back and let the situation resolve naturally, respecting her choice to be with someone else. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
