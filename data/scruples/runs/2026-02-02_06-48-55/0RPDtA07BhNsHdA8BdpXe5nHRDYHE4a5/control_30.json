She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out since the start of the school year and felt like a relationship was forming. The girl is described as fun, beautiful, modest, and they had a good time. The author thought she was leading them on, especially since her boyfriend looks just like them. They were hurt when they found out, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reach out again. Their friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they didn't come clean or stop. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the girl is already in a relationship. The author was not aware of the boyfriend initially, but after finding out, they continued to pursue her despite the boyfriend disliking them. The friend's reaction is a sign that the author's actions might be crossing a line.\n\nWhen someone is in a relationship, pursuing them can be problematic. Even if the author believed there was a mutual connection, the girl's boyfriend exists. The fact that the author didn't know about the boyfriend at first might be a point, but once they found out, continuing to pursue her could be seen as inappropriate. The author's interpretation of the girl's behavior (like texting them, saying they're great) might not have been reciprocated romantically, especially since she's with someone else. The friend calling them creepy suggests that their actions are not socially acceptable. Also, the boyfriend's dislike might indicate that the girl is in a committed relationship, and the author's persistence could be seen as disregarding her current relationship status. So, it's possible the author is in the wrong because they're pursuing someone who's already taken, which can create tension and harm existing relationships. Even if they have feelings, it's important to respect the girl's current commitment. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
