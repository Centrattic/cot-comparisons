She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The writer mentions they've been hanging out a lot, the girl is great, and they felt a relationship was forming. Then they found out she's dating someone who looks like them, which is confusing. The writer was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then resumed contact. Another friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue the girl.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's okay to pursue someone who's in a relationship. The writer's actions involve continuing to spend time with the girl after knowing she's with someone else. Even if they thought there was mutual interest before, once the writer found out she's in a relationship, it's important to respect her current commitment. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure about the writer might be a red flag, but the key point is that the writer is still engaging with the girl despite her being in a relationship. \n\nThe writer's friend called them creepy, which adds weight to the idea that this behavior isn't appropriate. The writer's belief that there's hope might be misplaced because the girl is already in a relationship. So, the answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they're pursuing someone who's in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate and could be seen as interfering or being dishonest.\n"
