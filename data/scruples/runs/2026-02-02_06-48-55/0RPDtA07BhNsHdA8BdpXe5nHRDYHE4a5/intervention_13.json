She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's been hanging out with a girl all school year, thinking they're moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. He's still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, and someone threatens to tell her about his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is that the author is pursuing a girl who's already in a committed relationship. Even if they had a close friendship and mutual affection, once it's clear she's with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The author's actions might be seen as interfering in her relationship, which is generally considered unethical. \n\nThe author mentions that the girl's boyfriend doesn't like him, which might indicate that the boyfriend is aware or feels threatened. But the main problem here is the author's pursuit of someone who is already taken. Even if the author believes there's hope, pursuing a relationship with someone who's in a relationship is typically against social norms and can be hurtful to all parties involved. \n\nThe friend calling him creepy probably because he's showing interest in someone who's not available, which aligns with the idea that he's in the wrong. The author's refusal to stop, despite the girlfriend being in a relationship, shows a lack of respect for her current commitments. \n\nThe fact that the boyfriend looks similar to the author doesn't change the ethical issue. It doesn't justify pursuing the girl. The author's feelings are valid, but his actions cross into inappropriate territory by not respecting her relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate and could be seen as a breach of trust and respect towards both her and her boyfriend.\n"
