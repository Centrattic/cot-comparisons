She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they're pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the scenario is that the author has been hanging out with this girl since the start of the school year. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and modest, and they felt like they were moving towards a relationship. The girl texted them often and expressed how great they were. But then the author finds out she's dating someone in their dorm who looks a lot like them. The author is hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. They still hang out, and the boyfriend doesn't like them. A friend called the author creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they don't stop or come clean. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for still believing there's hope.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points of the situation. The girl is already in a relationship. The author is pursuing her despite knowing this. The author even mentioned that the boyfriend probably doesn't like them because he's insecure. The author's actions here could be considered as continuing to pursue someone who is in a relationship, which might be seen as inappropriate or interfering. \n\nThe main ethical issue here is whether the author is respecting the girl's current relationship. If the girl has a boyfriend, then the author's pursuit could be seen as being in the wrong, especially if the boyfriend is aware and uncomfortable. Even if the author thought there was potential, once the relationship is known, pursuing it might not be acceptable. The author's friend calling them creepy suggests that others might view their actions as unsettling or inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to rationalize their actions by saying they still love the friendship, but if they're harboring romantic feelings and continuing to pursue her, that's not just friendship. The fact that they confessed to a friend, who then warned them, indicates that maybe the author's behavior crosses a line. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the girl is in a relationship, the author's continued interest might not be reciprocated in a romantic way, especially if the boyfriend is similar in appearance. The author's assumption that there's \"hope\" could be misguided because the girl is already committed. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because pursuing someone who's in a relationship can be seen as violating trust and boundaries. The author's actions, even if driven by feelings, might not consider the existing relationship and the boyfriend's feelings, which is problematic.\n"
