She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and the author thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then they found out she's dating someone who looks like him. The author got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. Now the author's friend is calling them creepy and threatening to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the girl is in a relationship. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest, once it's known she's with someone else, pursuing her could be problematic. The author might be ignoring the fact that the girl has made a commitment, and continuing to pursue her could be seen as disrespecting that commitment. Also, the boyfriend's disapproval is mentioned, which adds another layer of tension. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions are making others uncomfortable. Even if the author feels there was potential, once the relationship exists, moving forward could interfere with her current relationship. The key point is whether the author's actions are violating the girl's committed relationship. Since the author is still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, that's likely where the problem lies. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
