She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out a lot, and the author thinks there might be a relationship forming. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks similar to him. He's hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to reconnect. His friend calls him creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The author is continuing to interact with her despite her being in a committed relationship. Even though he might feel there was some mutual interest, once he knew she had a boyfriend, pursuing her would be considered inappropriate. The fact that the boyfriend looks like him adds some context, but it doesn't change the fact that the author is involved in a situation where one person is already in a relationship. \n\nHe mentions that he tried to reconnect after some time, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Then the friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl. The key here is that the author is persisting in pursuing a relationship with someone who is not single. Even if the girl is interested, it's ethically wrong because she's committed to someone else. The author's actions could be seen as leading the girl on or being dishonest, especially if he didn't make it clear that she's in a relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
