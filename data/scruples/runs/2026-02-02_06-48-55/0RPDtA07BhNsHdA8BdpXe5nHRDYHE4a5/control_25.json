She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (AITA) has been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year. They both seem to have mutual feelings, but then the girl is revealed to have a boyfriend who looks very similar. The AITA gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect, and now their friend is calling them creepy for continuing to pursue the girl.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The AITA was possibly leading on the girl by continuing to hang out and express affection without knowing about the boyfriend. Once they found out, the AITA was upset but then decided to keep pursuing her anyway, despite the boyfriend's disapproval. \n\nThe key point is that the girl is already committed to someone else. Even if the AITA thought there was a mutual connection, once they knew she was dating someone, continuing to pursue her could be seen as problematic. The boyfriend's disapproval suggests he's aware of the attention, which might make things more complicated. Also, the friend calling them creepy indicates that their actions might be going beyond what's acceptable, especially if it's making others uncomfortable.\n\nEven if the AITA believes there's hope, it's not the girl's decision to move on from her current relationship. The AITA's actions might be infringing on the boyfriend's relationship, which is unethical. The fact that they kept pursuing after knowing about the boyfriend's existence, and that their friend threatened to tell the girl, suggests that the AITA might be in the wrong here. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A because pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of the feelings involved.\n"
