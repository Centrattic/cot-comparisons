She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out since the school year started, both felt good about each other, but then the girl revealed she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. The other friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that the girl is already in a relationship. Even if the author thought there was potential for a relationship, once it's known that she's with someone else, pursuing her can be problematic. The author's actions of continuing to reach out and hang out might be seen as interfering in her existing relationship. \n\nThe author's justification is that they love the friendship and the time they spend together. However, maintaining a friendship with someone who is dating someone else is possible, but pursuing a romantic interest while they're in a relationship typically crosses a line. The author's feelings might be genuine, but the action of continuing to pursue her after knowing she's in a relationship is where the issue lies. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior might be making the girl uncomfortable or violating boundaries. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure adds another layer, but it's the author's persistence despite the relationship status that's the main problem here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship, which generally isn't acceptable regardless of the circumstances.\n"
