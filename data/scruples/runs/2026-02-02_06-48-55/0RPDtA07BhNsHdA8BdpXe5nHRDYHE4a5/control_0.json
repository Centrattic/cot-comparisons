She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there might be something more developing. Then the author found out she's dating someone who looks similar. The author was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend called them creepy for continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's already committed. The author thought there was a romantic connection, but that's not possible if she's with someone else. Even if the girl didn't reciprocate the feelings, the author's actions might be crossing a line by not respecting her current relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend doesn't like them and is probably insecure. But that doesn't justify the author's actions. It's not about the boyfriend's feelings but about respecting the girl's relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her despite knowing she's in a relationship, which is generally considered wrong because it's not respecting her commitments.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was to call them creepy and threaten to tell the girl. That's a red flag. If a friend feels that way, it's a sign that the behavior is indeed inappropriate. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be misplaced because the girl is already in a relationship. Hoping she'll leave her boyfriend isn't a valid reason to keep pursuing her.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the girl didn't explicitly say she was in a relationship, so the author might have thought there was a chance. But that's not the case. If the girl is with someone else, the author should have respected that boundary. Even if the girl is friendly, it doesn't mean there's room for romantic pursuit. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting her current relationship, hence being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pursuing someone who's in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful.\n"
