She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The author mentions they were hanging out a lot, thought they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her, then reached out again. Now he's continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship, and a friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship with someone else. The author believed there was mutual attraction and thought they were getting closer, but she chose to date someone else instead. The author's actions continue to pursue her, even after knowing she's in a relationship. That's a red flag because pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong, as it can interfere with the other person's commitments and cause emotional harm. \n\nThe author's friend labeled him as creepy, which suggests that his actions might be crossing boundaries. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure and dislikes the author adds to the tension. The author's justification is that he loves their friendship and wants to continue the relationship, but when one person is in a relationship, pursuing them romantically is not acceptable. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" despite the existing relationship is misplaced. Relationships require mutual consent and commitment. Since the girl is already with someone else, continuing to pursue her is ethically wrong. \n\nEven if there was mutual initial attraction, once it's known that she's in a relationship, the author should respect her commitment. The fact that the author was hurt is understandable, but that doesn't justify pursuing her while she's in a relationship. The friend's warning about being called creepy indicates that the author's behavior is inappropriate. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the girl's current relationship and is being persistent in a way that's intrusive.\n"
