She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started. The girl is described as fun, beautiful, and modest. The user felt like their relationship was moving towards a romantic one, with mutual texts and positive interactions. But then they found out the girl has a boyfriend who looks similar to them. The author is hurt and confused, wondering why she chose the other guy. They stopped talking for a few days but then tried to reconnect, maintaining their friendship. However, a friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl about their feelings if they don't stop.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing someone who's already in a relationship. From an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who's with another person can be problematic because it may interfere with an existing relationship. The author's actions could be seen as encouraging the girl to consider them as an alternative, which might not be fair to either the boyfriend or the girl. The fact that the author continued to pursue the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval adds to the complexity. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior might be crossing a line, even if they're not actively trying to break up the relationship. \n\nThe key points are: the girl is in a relationship, the author is pursuing her, and there's a risk of emotional harm. Even if the author believes there's \"hope,\" the girl is already committed. The author's actions could be manipulative or emotionally exploitative, especially if they're leading her to believe there's a chance while she's in another relationship. The author might not realize the wrong in their actions because they see it as maintaining a friendship, but the context of a boyfriend complicates things. \n\nIn many cultures and social norms, it's generally considered inappropriate to pursue someone who is in a committed relationship. The author could be in the wrong because they're not respecting the girl's current relationship status. Even if the girl is the one who initiated contact, the author's continued pursuit despite knowing she's with someone else is problematic. The friend's warning about being creepy might indicate that the author is overstepping boundaries. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which can be seen as unethical and potentially harmful.\n"
