She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the writer and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and he thought there was a budding relationship. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks a lot like him. He felt hurt, stopped talking to her, then reached out again. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he doesn't stop pursuing her.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The writer is continuing to pursue her even after discovering she's dating someone else. From a general perspective, pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is typically seen as wrong because it can be considered cheating or at least inappropriate. The writer's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, as mentioned. \n\nThe writer claims that their friendship and the time they spend together are important, but if the girl is in a relationship, continuing to engage in what the writer perceives as a \"relationship\" with her could be seen as emotional infidelity. The writer is also trying to justify his actions by saying he loves her and their friendship, but that doesn't negate the fact that she's already in a committed relationship. \n\nThe friend's reaction (calling him creepy) adds another layer. If others see his behavior as creepy, that's a red flag. Also, the writer is considering continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval, which is problematic. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's knowingly pursuing someone who is already in a relationship, which is generally considered unethical or wrong. Even if he believes there was some mutual interest, once the relationship status is known, continuing to pursue can be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable and the friend is calling him creepy supports that. The writer should respect the girl's relationship and step back.\n"
