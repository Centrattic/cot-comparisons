She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe writer has been hanging out with this girl since the school year started. He mentions that she's fun, beautiful, and they've been spending a lot of time together. He felt they were moving towards a relationship because she texted him a lot and said nice things. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, he's still pursuing her despite her being in a relationship, and a friend called him creepy for not being upfront about his feelings and threatening to tell the girl. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that the girl is already in a committed relationship. The writer is continuing to pursue her, which can be problematic. Even if he felt there was a connection, once he knew she was dating someone else, pursuing her could be seen as interfering in her relationship. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might add some complexity, but it doesn't necessarily justify his actions.\n\nHe mentions that he stopped talking to her for a few days after finding out, which shows he was hurt. But then he reached out again and continued their friendship. The issue here is that he's maintaining a close friendship with someone who's in a relationship, especially when he has romantic feelings for her. The friend called him creepy because he wasn't honest about his feelings and was continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, there's a norm that you shouldn't pursue someone who is already in a committed relationship. If the writer truly felt there was a connection and possibility of a relationship, he should have addressed that with the girl before pursuing her. However, since she's already with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be seen as inappropriate. The writer's actions, while perhaps stemming from genuine feelings, are interfering with her existing relationship, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's warning about being creepy and the threat to expose his feelings if he doesn't stop suggests that his actions are being perceived as crossing a boundary. Even if he believes there's hope, respecting her current relationship is important. It's possible that the girl isn't aware of his feelings, but pursuing her while she's in a relationship could lead to more harm, like causing her to feel torn or betraying her boyfriend's trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, the writer is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
