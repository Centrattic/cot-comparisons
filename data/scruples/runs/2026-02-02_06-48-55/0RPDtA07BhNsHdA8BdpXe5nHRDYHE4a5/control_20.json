She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there might be a relationship forming, but then found out she's dating someone else. The author is still trying to maintain the friendship despite the boyfriend's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here. The girl is in a relationship, so the author's pursuit could be seen as problematic. Even if the author thought there was mutual interest before knowing about the boyfriend, once they found out, continuing to pursue her might be crossing a line. The key point is that the girl isn't single, so the author's actions could be considered inappropriate, especially if they're still trying to develop a relationship when she's committed to someone else. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the boyfriend looks similar to them, which might explain the girl's attraction, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. The boyfriend is in a relationship, so the author's persistence might be seen as interfering. The fact that the author's friend called them creepy adds another layer, suggesting that their behavior might be making others uncomfortable, which is a red flag.\n\nHowever, the author says they still want to maintain the friendship and doesn't seem to be doing anything overtly aggressive. They stopped talking for a few days after finding out but then reached out again. The question is whether pursuing a friendship with someone who's in a relationship is wrong. If the author isn't trying to break them up and is just maintaining the friendship, maybe it's not as bad. But the line between friendship and pursuit can be blurry here. If the author is still showing interest and the girl isn't reciprocating (since she's with someone else), that could be the issue.\n\nThe main ethical consideration is respecting the girl's current relationship. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the boyfriend's relationship without the girl's consent. Even if the author believes there's potential, acting on it when the girl is in a committed relationship is generally not acceptable. The friend's threat to expose the author's feelings might indicate that the author's behavior is causing tension and discomfort, which supports the idea that they're overstepping.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship, which can be considered inappropriate and potentially harmful to both her and her partner. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
