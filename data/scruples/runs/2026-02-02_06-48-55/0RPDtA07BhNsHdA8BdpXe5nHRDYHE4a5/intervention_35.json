She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The scenario is that the guy and the girl have been hanging out a lot, he thought they were moving towards a relationship, but then he found out she's dating someone who looks similar. He got hurt, stopped talking to her for a bit, then tried to reconnect. His friend called him creepy for not coming clean or stopping.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl is in a relationship. The author believed they were moving towards a relationship but didn't know about her boyfriend. He continued to pursue her after finding out. Even after his friend's warning, he still wants to maintain the friendship and pursue her. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's not respectful to the existing relationship. The author might have had feelings, but the girl is committed elsewhere. The fact that he tried to reconnect after knowing about the boyfriend suggests he's still interested, which could be seen as crossing a boundary. The friend's reaction (\"creepy\") adds weight to the idea that others see this as inappropriate. The author's justification is that he loves their friendship and relationship, but that doesn't change the fact that she's already in a relationship. So, yeah, he's probably in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
