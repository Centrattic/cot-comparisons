She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The author mentions they've been hanging out a lot, felt things were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone similar to him.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her, which could be seen as interfering. Even if they had a close friendship, once you know she's with someone else, pursuing her might not be appropriate. The author was hurt and stopped talking for a few days, but then continued the friendship. The fact that the boyfriend is jealous adds another layer, but the main issue is the author's actions towards a girl who's in a committed relationship.\n\nThe friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her, which might indicate that the actions are crossing a boundary. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's aware of her relationship and still chooses to pursue her, it's a yes. So the answer should be A.\n"
