She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (the author) has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They really liked her and thought there was a romantic connection forming. But then they found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author is hurt but continues to pursue the friendship, even after the boyfriend is apparently uncomfortable. Now a friend is calling them creepy and threatening to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's already in a committed relationship. Even if they thought there was a connection, once the author knew about the boyfriend, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The author mentions that they tried to move past it and keep the friendship, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable. The author might be crossing boundaries here by not respecting the girl's relationship status. \n\nAlso, the author is in denial about the situation. The girl is with someone else, so the idea that there's \"hope\" might be unrealistic. The friend's warning suggests that the author's actions are making others uncomfortable, which is a red flag. The act of continuing to pursue a friend who's in a relationship can be seen as inappropriate, especially if the author is ignoring the boyfriend's discomfort. \n\nAdditionally, the author's behavior could be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her partner. Even if the author believes there's a connection, the girl has chosen to be in a relationship, and the author should respect that. Pursuing her while she's in a relationship could be considered emotionally manipulative or at the very least, not considerate of her current commitments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they are pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in a committed relationship, which is generally considered unethical. The friend's reaction and the boyfriend's discomfort support that the author's actions are not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
