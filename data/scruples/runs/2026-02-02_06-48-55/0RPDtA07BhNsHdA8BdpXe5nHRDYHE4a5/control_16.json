She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been spending a lot of time with a girl who has a boyfriend. They thought there was a mutual attraction and maybe a budding relationship, but then found out she's already with someone else who looks similar. The author stopped talking to her for a few days but then reached out again, and now their friend is calling them creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship is wrong. The author says they love the girl and believe there's hope, but the girl is committed to someone else. Even though they had a close friendship and mutual enjoyment of each other's company, the girl is in a relationship. The friend's reaction is a red flag, suggesting that the author's actions might be crossing boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, if someone is in a committed relationship and you start pursuing them, that's generally considered wrong because it interferes with their existing relationship. The author mentions that the girl's boyfriend is insecure, which might indicate that the boyfriend is aware of the attention, and the author is continuing to pursue despite that. The fact that the friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they didn't stop suggests that the author's actions are being seen as inappropriate or stalker-like.\n\nAnother angle: the author thought they were building a relationship, but the girl was already with someone else. Even if there was mutual friendship and some emotional connection, pursuing a relationship with someone who is taken is generally frowned upon. The author's insistence that there's hope despite the girl being in a relationship might not be realistic. The girl hasn't expressed any intention to end her relationship, so the author's belief in \"hope\" is perhaps based on their own desires rather than the girl's actual situation.\n\nAlso, the author is continuing to hang out with the girl after knowing she's in a relationship, which could be seen as disrespectful to her boyfriend and potentially harmful to the girl's current relationship. The friend's warning is a sign that the author's behavior is not socially acceptable. The fact that the author is trying to maintain a friendship while also pursuing romantic feelings might be confusing for the girl and her boyfriend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a situation where they are actively pursuing someone who is already in a relationship. Even if there were mutual friendship and some emotional connection, continuing to pursue a romantic relationship is generally considered wrong. The friend's reaction underscores that the author's actions are problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
