She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The author mentions that they've been hanging out since the school year started, developing feelings, and even getting hurt when they found out she's dating someone who looks similar. The key points here are: the girl is already in a relationship, the author continued to pursue her after knowing, and a friend called them creepy.\n\nFirst, the main ethical issue is that the girl is in a committed relationship. Pursuing someone who is already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as interfering and may lead to emotional harm for all parties involved. The author felt they had a \"wonderful thing brewing,\" but the girl chose someone else. The author's actions of continuing to reach out, despite the boyfriend's disapproval, might be crossing a line. The friend's warning adds that the author might be seen as \"creepy,\" which is a red flag.\n\nAnother angle is the author's justification. They claim they love the girl and their friendship, but pursuing a romantic relationship with someone who is in love with another person is ethically questionable. The author's belief that there's hope might be ignoring the reality that the girl is already committed. The fact that the boyfriend looks similar might be a coincidence, but it doesn't change the fact that the author is pursuing someone who isn't available.\n\nThe author's actions could cause emotional distress for the girl and her boyfriend. Even if the author isn't intentionally trying to break them up, continuing to pursue a relationship with a taken woman is not acceptable. The friend's threat to expose the author's feelings suggests that the behavior is going beyond friendly interactions. The line between friendly and pursuing is crossed when there's a conscious effort to develop a romantic relationship with someone who is in another relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they are pursuing a romantic interest who is already in a committed relationship, which is generally considered unethical. The actions described could be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her boyfriend, and the author's belief that there's hope doesn't override the fact that the girl is already taken. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
