She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and he thought there was a romantic connection. Then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar. He stopped talking to her for a few days but then resumed, and now he's continuing to pursue her despite the boyfriend's disapproval. His friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl has a boyfriend, so the author is pursuing her while she's in a relationship. That's the main issue. Even if they were close friends and had a connection, once it's established that she's with someone else, pursuing her could be problematic. The author's actions might be seen as interfering in her current relationship, which is generally frowned upon because it can cause emotional harm to all parties involved.\n\nThe author mentions that he felt like there was a budding relationship, but the girl chose to date someone else. That suggests she didn't reciprocate romantic feelings, even if they were close friends. Continuing to pursue her after knowing she's in a relationship might be considered disrespectful towards her current partner and could be seen as manipulative or obsessive, especially since the boyfriend is uncomfortable with him. The friend's warning that he's creepy adds weight to that possibility.\n\nAnother angle is the author's reasoning. He believes there's still hope, but in reality, the girl is already committed. The line between friendship and pursuing someone is crossed here. The author might not realize that the girl's actions (dating someone else) indicate she doesn't want a relationship with him. Continuing to pursue could be seen as not respecting her choice and boundaries.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the author trying to maintain a friendship. If he's not making advances but just being a friend, that's different. But the situation says he's \"pursuing\" her, which implies romantic interest. The boyfriend's dislike and the friend's comment suggest he's going beyond friendly behavior. Also, the author's initial hurt and then continuing to reach out might indicate he's not respecting her relationship status.\n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship, which can be considered inappropriate and potentially harmful. Even if there was a connection before, respecting her current relationship status is crucial. The friend's reaction and the boyfriend's discomfort further support that his actions are crossing a line.\n"
