She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The story says they've been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The girl is described as fun and beautiful, and the author feels they were moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her, then reaches out again. His friend threatens to tell her if he doesn't stop. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the girl is already in a relationship. The author is pursuing her despite that. Even if they were close friends and she didn't reciprocate his feelings, he's still trying to get close while she's with someone else. The fact that she's with another guy is a key point. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in her relationship, which is generally considered wrong. Also, the guy's friend called him creepy, which adds some social judgment. The author's belief that there's hope might be a defense mechanism. He might be ignoring clear boundaries because they're in a relationship. Even if the girl was flirting or hanging out a lot, that doesn't mean she's available. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the girl's current partner. So, from an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is typically frowned upon. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
