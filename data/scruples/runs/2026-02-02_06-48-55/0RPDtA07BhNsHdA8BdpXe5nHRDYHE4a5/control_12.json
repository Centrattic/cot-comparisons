She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The person wrote that they've been hanging out with the girl since the school year started, they felt like they were moving towards a relationship, and then found out she's dating someone who looks a lot like them. They were hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now, their friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl if they don't stop.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the girl is in a relationship, so any pursuit from someone else is problematic. Even if the girl reciprocated some feelings, she's already committed. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship but didn't realize she was seeing someone else. But now they're continuing to pursue her, which is the main issue.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it disrupts the existing relationship and can cause emotional harm. The author's actions might be seen as deceptive if they were aware of her relationship status at some point. However, the story says that the author found out later that she had a boyfriend. So maybe they weren't aware initially. But once they found out, continuing to pursue her is definitely crossing a line. The author's friend's reaction suggests that the behavior is inappropriate.\n\nThe fact that the boyfriend disapproves might indicate that the author's presence is making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which is another red flag. The author's justification is that they love the girl and their friendship, but that doesn't excuse pursuing a relationship with someone who is already committed. Even if the girl is attracted to both people, the right thing would be to honor her current relationship, not try to pursue her. The author's belief that there's hope is misplaced because the girl is already in a relationship. So, in this case, the author is not respecting the girl's existing commitment, which makes them the asshole. The answer should be A.\n"
