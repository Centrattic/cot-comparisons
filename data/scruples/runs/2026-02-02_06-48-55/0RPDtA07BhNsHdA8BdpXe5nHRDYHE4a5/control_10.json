She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the girl and the author were hanging out a lot, and he thought there was a mutual connection. But she's dating someone else who looks similar. The author got hurt, stopped talking, then tried to reconnect. The friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, if she's in a committed relationship, pursuing her could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the author didn't know about her boyfriend initially, once he found out, continuing to pursue her might not be respectful. The key points here are whether the author is aware of her relationship status and if his actions are appropriate.\n\nWhen he found out she was dating someone else, he should have respected her relationship. Instead, he kept reaching out and trying to maintain their connection, which could be considered as trying to interfere. The fact that her boyfriend looks similar adds to the confusion, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The friend's reaction suggests that his actions are inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the author might be in denial about the reality of the situation. If the girl is in a relationship, the author's pursuit isn't just about his feelings but also about respecting her current commitment. The fact that he's called creepy by a friend indicates others see the issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's continuing to pursue someone who's already in a relationship, which isn't respectful of her or her partner. The answer would be A.\n"
