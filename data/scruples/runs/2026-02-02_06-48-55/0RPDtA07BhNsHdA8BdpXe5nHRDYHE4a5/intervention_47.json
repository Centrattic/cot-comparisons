She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The author describes being close friends with the girl since the school year started, feeling that they're moving towards a relationship, but then finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her briefly, then reached out again. His friend called him creepy for continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key point here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author's actions of pursuing her while she's with someone else are problematic. Even if the girl showed signs of liking him, those might have been within the bounds of her existing relationship. The author's assumption that their friendship was becoming a relationship might be a misinterpretation, especially since she's with someone else. \n\nThe author's continued pursuit despite knowing she's in a relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that the boyfriend looks like the author might add to the situation, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The author's friend labeled him as creepy, which aligns with the idea that pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can complicate the existing relationship and is often seen as unethical or disrespectful.\n\nEven if the author believes there's \"hope,\" the girl's relationship status is a clear boundary. The author's actions, especially after the friend's warning, could be damaging to the girl's current relationship and his own relationships if others find out. The emotional impact on the boyfriend and the potential for hurting the girl are important factors here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is indeed in the wrong for continuing to pursue someone who is already in a committed relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
