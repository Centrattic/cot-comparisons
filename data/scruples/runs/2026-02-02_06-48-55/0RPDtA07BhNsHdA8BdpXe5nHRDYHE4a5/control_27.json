She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy has been hanging out with a girl since the start of the school year. They both seem to have a good time, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she's already dating someone who looks a lot like him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a relationship. The guy didn't know about the boyfriend initially and thought there was a mutual connection. But once he found out, he was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days. Then he decided to reach out again and continue their friendship, but the boyfriend doesn't like him. The friend also calls him creepy and warns him to stop or else he'll be exposed.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girl is already in a relationship. The guy was pursuing her without knowing she had a boyfriend. Even after finding out, he's still trying to maintain a close friendship, which could be seen as inappropriate because the boyfriend is uncomfortable. The friend's reaction suggests that continuing to pursue her is not okay.\n\nThe question is whether the guy is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as being in a position to potentially interfere with that relationship. Even if the girl isn't currently reciprocating romantic feelings, the guy's actions might be crossing a boundary. Also, the fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable and the friend labeled him as creepy adds to the concern.\n\nBut there's a part where the guy says he loves their friendship and the time together. But if the girl is with someone else, maintaining that level of interaction could be problematic. Even if the girl isn't reciprocating, the fact that he's pursuing her after knowing she's in a relationship could be problematic. The line between friendship and pursuing someone is blurry here. \n\nThe main issue is that the girl is in a relationship, and the guy's actions could be seen as pursuing her, which might not be respectful to her current partner. Even if there's mutual affection in the friendship, the boyfriend's discomfort and the friend's warning suggest that the guy's behavior is crossing a line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Because he's pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship, which can be considered inappropriate and potentially unethical.\n"
