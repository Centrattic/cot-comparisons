She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out since the school year started, and they felt like there was a budding relationship. But then they found out she's dating someone else who looks like them. They were hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. The boyfriend doesn't like them, and a friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl already has a boyfriend. The author is continuing to pursue her despite knowing that. Even if they thought there was mutual feelings, once they found out she's in a relationship, continuing to pursue her would be problematic. It's not just about their own feelings but also respecting the existing relationship. The author mentions that they stopped talking for a few days but then went back to hanging out. That suggests they didn't stop the pursuit entirely. \n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend looks similar might be a red flag for the girl's boyfriend, leading to his insecurity. The author's actions could be seen as playing into that insecurity, which isn't fair. The friend's reaction is a clue too\u2014calling them creepy and warning them to stop. That implies that the actions might be overstepping boundaries. \n\nEven if the author believes there's hope, pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's not respecting their current commitment. The girl might have led the author on, but the key point is that the author continued to engage despite knowing the relationship status. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pursuing someone who's already in a relationship, which is unethical and could be seen as creepy.\n"
