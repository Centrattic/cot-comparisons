She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author kept pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there was a chance they could be together. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He got hurt, stopped talking to her, then reached out again. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's not available. Even if they were close friends and she was friendly, the fact remains she's with someone else. The author's actions of continuing to pursue her after knowing she's in a relationship could be seen as inappropriate. The friend called him creepy, which suggests others see it that way. Also, the author mentions the boyfriend doesn't like him, which could be due to insecurity, but that doesn't justify the author's actions.\n\nEven if the author felt there was mutual interest, once he knew she was dating someone else, the ethical thing would be to step back. Pursuing a relationship with someone who's already in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm. The author was hurt and confused, but that doesn't excuse continuing to pursue her. The friend's warning indicates that the author's behavior might be crossing a line. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
