She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. He feels like they were getting closer and that she might be interested in him. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. Now he's being told by a friend that he's being creepy and needs to stop or come clean.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to pursue someone who's already in a relationship. The guy claims he's not trying to break them up but still wants to maintain their friendship and the connection they had. However, even if he's not directly trying to interfere, pursuing a friend who's in a relationship can be seen as inappropriate because it could lead to complications. The boyfriend's disapproval is mentioned, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nHe also mentions that he's in love with her and believes there's \"hope,\" but the girl is already committed. The friend's warning about being creepy suggests that his actions might be crossing a boundary. Even if the girl isn't reciprocating his feelings, continuing to pursue her while she's in a relationship could be considered disrespectful to her current partner and potentially manipulative if she's not aware of his feelings.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) She's in a relationship, 2) He's continuing to pursue her despite knowing this, 3) The boyfriend is uncomfortable with him, and 4) His actions are causing tension. The line between friendship and romantic pursuit is blurry here. If he's expressing interest or acting in ways that suggest he wants more than friendship, he's likely overstepping. Even if he's not actively trying to break them up, his behavior could create emotional distress for both the girl and her boyfriend.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong because he's pursuing a relationship with someone who's already committed. It's important to respect others' relationships and not create situations that could lead to jealousy or conflict. Even if his intentions are good, the actions are problematic in this context.\n"
