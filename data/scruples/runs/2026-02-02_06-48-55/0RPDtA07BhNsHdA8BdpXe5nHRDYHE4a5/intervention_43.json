She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the guy and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. He thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she has a boyfriend who looks like him. He was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now he's still pursuing her, and his friend called him creepy if he doesn't stop. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are: the girl is already in a relationship, the guy thought they were getting close, but he was wrong. Pursuing someone who's in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's not respecting their current commitment. Even if the girl might have feelings for him too, the boyfriend exists. The guy's actions could be seen as trying to break up a relationship, which is unethical.\n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend looks similar might add to the confusion, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The guy should have considered her relationship status before pursuing her. Even if he's just being friends now, continuing to pursue her while she's in a relationship is a problem. His friend's reaction (calling him creepy) supports the idea that his actions are inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong. He's pursuing someone who's already in a relationship, which is generally considered unethical and disrespectful.\n"
