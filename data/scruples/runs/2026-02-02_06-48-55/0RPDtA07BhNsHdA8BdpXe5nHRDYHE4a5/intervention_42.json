She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The writer has been hanging out with her a lot, and they both seemed to be getting close. The girl's boyfriend looks similar to the writer, which adds some complexity. The writer was hurt when he found out about the boyfriend, stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again. Now, the writer is continuing to hang out with her, even though the boyfriend is uncomfortable. Another friend called the writer creepy and threatened to tell the girl about his feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the writer is wrong for continuing to pursue a relationship with a girl who's already in a relationship. Let me break down the key points. The girl has a boyfriend, so pursuing her while she's in a committed relationship is a red flag. Even if the writer and the girl were mutually interested before the boyfriend was introduced, once it's known that she's in a relationship, the writer should probably respect that and not continue pursuing her. The fact that the writer is still hanging out with her despite the boyfriend's objections suggests that he's not respecting her current relationship. \n\nThe writer mentions that he loves their friendship and the time they spend together, but if the girl is in a relationship, then developing a romantic interest in her complicates that friendship. It's not just about the writer's feelings but also about being respectful to her partner and not causing harm. The friend who called him creepy is pointing out that his actions might be inappropriate, especially since he's aware of her relationship status. \n\nAlso, the fact that the writer is still reaching out and maintaining the friendship while having romantic feelings is problematic. It could lead the girl into a situation where she might be tempted to cheat, which isn't fair to her boyfriend or the writer. The writer is essentially creating a situation where he's pursuing someone who isn't available, which is generally considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm for all parties involved.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of emotional boundaries. The writer's feelings are valid, but acting on them when the girl is in a relationship crosses a line. The boyfriend's discomfort is a sign that the writer's actions are affecting others, even if he doesn't care about that. The threat from the friend adds another layer, indicating that others see the behavior as inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is in a committed relationship, which is disrespectful to her boyfriend and could lead to infidelity. Even if there was prior mutual interest, once the relationship status is known, the writer should step back. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
