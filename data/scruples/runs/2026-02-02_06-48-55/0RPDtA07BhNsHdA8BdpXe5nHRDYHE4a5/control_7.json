She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the girl in question is dating someone else, which is a key point. The author has been hanging out with her a lot and feels they were moving towards a relationship. But she's already committed to another person. The author mentions that the boyfriend looks similar to him, which adds a layer of confusion, but that doesn't change the fact that she's in a relationship.\n\nThe author stops talking to her for a few days after finding out, which is understandable, but then reaches out again and resumes hanging out. That's where the problem starts. Continuing to pursue someone who's in a relationship can be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the reasons. The other friend calls the author creepy, which suggests that the behavior is crossing a line, especially since the boyfriend is reportedly uncomfortable with the situation.\n\nThe author's belief that there's \"hope\" despite the existing relationship might stem from misreading signals. However, the fact remains that the girl is in a relationship, and actively pursuing her could be seen as interfering. Even if the author thinks the relationship isn't working out, it's not his place to step in unless she's open to ending it. Since she's still with her boyfriend, the author's actions could be considered as being in the wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the threat from the friend to tell the girl about the feelings might be a red flag that the author's behavior is being perceived as intrusive or inappropriate. The author needs to respect the girl's current relationship and step back to avoid causing further harm or complications.\n"
