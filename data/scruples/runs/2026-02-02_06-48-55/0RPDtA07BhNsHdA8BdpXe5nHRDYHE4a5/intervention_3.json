She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the writer and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and there were signs that maybe they were getting closer. The writer felt they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out the girl was actually dating someone else who looks similar. The writer is now continuing to pursue her, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, the main ethical point here is whether it's right to pursue someone who is already in a relationship. Even if there were hints of mutual interest, once you know the person is committed to someone else, continuing to pursue them can be seen as interfering with their relationship. The key here is that the writer didn't know about the boyfriend at first, but after finding out, they chose to keep reaching out. That's where the problem lies. \n\nThe writer mentions that they were told by a friend that they're being creepy and should stop. The friend's reaction suggests that the pursuit is inappropriate. Also, the boyfriend's discomfort adds another layer, indicating that the writer's actions are affecting another person's relationship negatively.\n\nEven if the writer felt there was potential, once they knew the girl was in a relationship, their continued pursuit crosses a boundary. It's possible the girl never reciprocated the same feelings but was just being friendly. The writer's assumption that they were \"moving towards a relationship\" might be misinterpreting her actions. \n\nSo, the answer here is that the writer is in the wrong because they are pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship, regardless of their own feelings. The right approach would have been to respect her relationship and step back.\n"
