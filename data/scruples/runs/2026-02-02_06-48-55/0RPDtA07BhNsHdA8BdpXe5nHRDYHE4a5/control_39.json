She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that the girl and the author have been hanging out a lot, and the author thought there was potential for a relationship. But then he found out she's already dating someone similar to him. The author is confused and hurt, and after a brief break, he reached out again. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop. So the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girl has a boyfriend, so the author is pursuing her while she's in a relationship. That's a red flag right there. The author thought they were moving towards a relationship, but the girl is already committed elsewhere. Even if the guy looks similar, the main issue is that the author is continuing to pursue someone who is not available. \n\nThe author mentions that he stopped talking to her for a few days but then resumed contact. He's still hanging out with her despite knowing she's in a relationship. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions are crossing a line. Even if the author believes there's mutual interest, the girl is in a committed relationship, which makes the pursuit inappropriate. \n\nAnother point is the author's justification: he loves their friendship and the time they spend together. However, continuing to pursue a relationship with someone who is already in a relationship can be seen as disrespectful to her current partner and potentially manipulative. The author might be ignoring the girl's boundaries by not accepting that she's with someone else.\n\nThe fact that the girl's boyfriend is jealous adds another layer, but that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The main wrong here is the pursuit of a relationship with an unavailable person. The author might not realize that he's overstepping by continuing to express feelings and maintain contact after knowing she's in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's friend calling him creepy indicates that his actions are not socially acceptable. The threat to expose his feelings if he doesn't stop suggests that his behavior is being viewed as inappropriate or stalker-like. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the author has feelings and thought there was mutual interest, the girl is in a relationship. Persisting in pursuing her after that knowledge is generally considered wrong because it disregards her current commitment. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
