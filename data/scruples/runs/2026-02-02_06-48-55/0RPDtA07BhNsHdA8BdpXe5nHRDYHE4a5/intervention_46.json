She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was friends with a girl, thought they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone else. The author kept pursuing her even after knowing about the boyfriend, and now a friend is threatening to tell her.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The girl had a boyfriend all along. The author didn't know at first, but after finding out, instead of respecting her relationship, he continued to hang out with her and pursue her. The boyfriend looks similar, which the author is upset about. The author is hurt and feels there's hope, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable with him, which the author doesn't care about. He's also been told by a friend that this makes him creepy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The girl is in a committed relationship. 2) The author continued to pursue her after knowing this. 3) The author's actions caused discomfort to the boyfriend and were deemed creepy by a friend. \n\nIn terms of social norms, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as interfering with an existing commitment. Even if the author thought there was a mutual interest before, once the relationship was known, the appropriate action would be to step back and respect her choice. Continuing to pursue her could be seen as undermining the boyfriend's relationship and possibly leading to emotional harm for everyone involved.\n\nThe author's belief that there's still hope might be a case of denial or not accepting her current relationship status. The fact that the boyfriend is uncomfortable and the friend called him creepy suggests that his actions are indeed problematic. The author's justification is that he loves their friendship and the time together, but if the girl is in a relationship, maintaining a friendship might also require boundaries to respect her partner's feelings.\n\nSo, based on these points, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
