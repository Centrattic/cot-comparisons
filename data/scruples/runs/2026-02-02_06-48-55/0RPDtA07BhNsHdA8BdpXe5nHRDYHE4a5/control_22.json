She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. He thought they were getting close, maybe even moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. His friend calls him creepy for continuing to pursue her despite her being taken.\n\nSo, the main points are: he had feelings for someone who's already in a relationship. He pursued her even after knowing she's with someone else. The key issue here is whether pursuing a girl who's in a relationship is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, most people would say that it's not appropriate to pursue someone who is already committed. It can be seen as disrespectful to the partner and can complicate their relationship.\n\nEven though the guy felt they had a connection and that the girl might have been interested, once he found out she's dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be considered inappropriate. The fact that he reached out again and kept hanging out might be seen as crossing boundaries. The friend's reaction, calling him creepy, suggests that his actions are not socially acceptable. The girl's boyfriend disliking him adds another layer, possibly indicating tension or jealousy, but that's not an excuse for the guy's behavior.\n\nHe might argue that he still values their friendship, but pursuing a romantic relationship while she's in a committed relationship is generally frowned upon. The line between friendly and romantic pursuit is crossed when one is aware of the other's relationship status. So, the answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship, which is considered unethical and disrespectful.\n"
