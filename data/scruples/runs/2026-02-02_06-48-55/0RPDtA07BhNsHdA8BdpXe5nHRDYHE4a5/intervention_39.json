She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where he's pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The story goes that the girl was hanging out with the author a lot, and he thought they were getting close. Then he found out she's dating someone who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend is calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl if he doesn't stop. The user thinks the author is wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is pursuing someone who's already in a relationship. The author believed there was hope because they were spending time together and had mutual feelings, but the girl is committed to another person. Even if the boyfriend is similar in appearance, that doesn't change the fact that she's with someone else. The author's actions of continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe friend's reaction is another clue here. The friend called him creepy and threatened to expose his feelings. That suggests that the author's behavior is crossing a boundary. The fact that the boyfriend doesn't like him adds another layer, but the main issue is the author's pursuit of a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nEven if the author had genuine feelings and thought there was potential, once he found out about the boyfriend, continuing to pursue her would be wrong. The term \"creepy\" is a strong indicator that his actions are not just inconsiderate but possibly stalker-like. The author might believe he's showing love by reaching out again, but in reality, respecting her current relationship is the right thing. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be that the author is indeed in the wrong. The right choice is A.\n"
