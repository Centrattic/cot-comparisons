She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the guy and the girl have been hanging out a lot, and he thought they were moving towards a relationship. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then tries to reconnect. Now his friend is calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl about his feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to pursue someone who's already in a relationship. Even if the guy thought there was mutual interest, once he knew she was with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The friend's reaction suggests that the guy's actions are crossing a line, especially if he's still trying to build a relationship while she's committed to another person. \n\nThe guy might feel he's not in the wrong because he believed there was a connection, but relationships require mutual consent. If she's in a relationship, pursuing her could interfere with her commitment. The fact that she has a boyfriend and he's trying to maintain friendship while having feelings for her might not be respectful to her current partner. Also, the friend's comment about him being creepy indicates that his actions are socially frowned upon. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' relationships is key. So, even if he's not intentionally trying to break them up, his pursuit could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
