She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who has a boyfriend. The situation is that the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author feels they're moving towards a relationship, but then finds out she's dating someone who looks like him. He's hurt, stops talking to her, then tries to reconnect. His friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her even after learning about her boyfriend. Even if the author believes there's hope, intentionally pursuing someone who's in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. The fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance might make the author feel like the relationship is replaceable, but that doesn't justify pursuing a relationship with someone who's already taken.\n\nThe author mentions that he reached out again after some time, so he's aware of the boyfriend but still continues to engage. The friend's warning about being creepy and the threat to expose his feelings suggests that his actions are socially unacceptable. The author's belief that there's \"hope\" might be a way to rationalize his actions, but realistically, once someone is in a relationship, pursuing them is not appropriate. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to both the girl and her boyfriend. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
