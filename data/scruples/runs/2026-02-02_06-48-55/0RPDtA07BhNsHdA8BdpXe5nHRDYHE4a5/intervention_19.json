She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong (AITA). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has been spending a lot of time with a girl who he's clearly interested in. He thought they were moving towards a relationship because she was nice and they had fun together. But then he found out she's dating someone who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, then tried to reconnect. He's still pursuing her friendship and possibly a relationship despite her being in a relationship with someone else. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he didn't stop or confess.\n\nThe key points here: the girl has a boyfriend. The author is continuing to pursue her, even after knowing she's in a relationship. The guy looks similar, but that doesn't change the fact that she's already committed. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in an existing relationship. Even if he thought there was mutual interest before, once he knew she was dating someone else, pursuing her might be considered wrong.\n\nHe also mentioned confessing his feelings to a friend, who warned him against it. So there's some social pressure here. The question is whether continuing to pursue someone who's in a relationship is acceptable. Generally, respecting someone's current relationship is important. Even if the feelings are mutual, continuing to pursue would be considered wrong because it could harm the existing relationship. The author might not realize that the girl's interest in him could be part of the reason her current partner is insecure, but he's choosing to ignore that and keep pursuing, which is problematic.\n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. He's knowingly pursuing a girl who's in a relationship, which is generally frowned upon. The fact that he thought there was mutual interest before doesn't excuse his actions once he knew about the boyfriend. The friend's warning also highlights that others see his behavior as inappropriate.\n"
