She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author started hanging out with a girl since the beginning of the school year. They both seemed to enjoy each other's company, and the author thought there was a budding relationship. Then he found out she was dating someone who looks similar to him. He got hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then reached out again. He's continuing to hang out with her despite her being in a relationship. His friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl about his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are that the girl is in a committed relationship, and the author is pursuing her. Even if he thought there was mutual interest, once he knew she was dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. The friend's reaction suggests that the behavior is crossing a line. Also, the author mentions that the boyfriend doesn't like him, which might indicate that the boyfriend is aware of the attention, making it even more inappropriate.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as interfering in an existing relationship. Even if the girl didn't reciprocate romantic feelings, maintaining a friendship while the girl is in a relationship might not be wrong, but the author's belief that there's \"hope\" and continuing to pursue her could be the issue. The line between friendship and pursuing someone in a relationship is thin here. The author's actions could be considered as the wrong thing because he's not respecting the girl's relationship status and is potentially making the boyfriend uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
