She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that the two of them have been hanging out a lot, and the author thought they were moving towards a relationship. Then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He gets hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. His friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is in a relationship, so the author is pursuing someone who's not single. That's a big red flag. Even if they were close friends, the author thought there was potential for a relationship, but she's already with someone else. The fact that she's dating someone similar to the author doesn't change the fact that she's in a committed relationship. The author is continuing to pursue her despite knowing this, which could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nThe author's actions include confessing feelings and continuing to hang out, which might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable. The friend's comment that he's creepy suggests that his behavior crosses a line. Even if he claims it's about friendship and not wanting to stop, pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can create tension and potentially break up the existing relationship. The author might be in denial about his intentions, thinking it's just friendship, but the actions of pursuing someone who is taken are problematic. So the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
