She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The author claims they were hanging out a lot and thought they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's dating someone similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking for a bit, then reached out again, and now his friend called him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: the girl is in a relationship, the author kept pursuing her even after knowing she has a boyfriend, and he confessed his feelings to a friend who is warning him. The main issue here is that pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally not acceptable. Even if they were close friends before, once you know they're with someone else, continuing to pursue them can be seen as inappropriate. The author's actions of reaching out again and not caring about the boyfriend's feelings might cross boundaries. The fact that the friend called him creepy suggests that others see his actions as intrusive. So, even if the author believes there's hope, the reality is that he's in a situation where the girl isn't available, and his pursuit is likely making the current boyfriend uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the girl's relationship status and is continuing to pursue her despite the clear boundary.\n"
