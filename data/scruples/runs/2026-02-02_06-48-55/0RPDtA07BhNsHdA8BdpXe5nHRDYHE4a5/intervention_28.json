She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves him pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girl and the author were hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author feels they were moving towards a relationship, and the girl texts him often. But then he finds out she's dating someone else who looks like him. He's hurt, stops talking for a few days, then reaches out again. He continues to hang out with her despite her being in a relationship. His friend calls him creepy for not coming clean.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that the girl is already in a relationship. The author is pursuing her, which could be seen as inappropriate. Even if the girl seems to enjoy his company, continuing to hang out and express feelings while she's with someone else is problematic. The boyfriend's disapproval adds another layer; the author is still interacting with her which might make the boyfriend uncomfortable.\n\nThe key point here is that the girl isn't single, so the author's actions could be considered as interfering in an existing relationship. Even if there were mutual feelings, the ethical thing would be to respect her current relationship. The author's persistence without addressing the existing boyfriend situation makes him the one in the wrong. The friend labeling him as creepy is a reaction to his pursuit despite knowing she's taken. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
