She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The scenario involves the girl spending time with the author, showing positive signs, but then revealing she has a boyfriend. The author feels hurt and continues to pursue the relationship despite the boyfriend's disapproval. Another friend even calls the author creepy.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. The author's actions could be seen as inappropriate because pursuing someone who's already in a relationship can interfere with their commitment. Even if the girl seemed to reciprocate some feelings, she chose to be with someone else, so the author's continued pursuit might not consider her current relationship status.\n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend looks similar to him, which might explain why the girl was interested, but that doesn't justify ignoring the existing relationship. The main problem is that the author is trying to develop a relationship with someone who's already partnered, which could be seen as disrespectful to both her and her boyfriend. Additionally, the friend's warning that the author is being creepy and should stop highlights the social and ethical concerns of his actions.\n\nSo, considering the girl's relationship status and the impact of the author's actions on her and her partner, the author is likely in the wrong. The right choice would be to respect her current relationship and not pursue her. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
