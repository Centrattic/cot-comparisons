She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. They describe her as fun, beautiful, and someone they really like. They thought there was a budding relationship, felt happy when she texted them, etc. Then they found out she's dating someone else who looks a lot like them. The author was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, but then decided to continue the friendship. However, the author now has feelings for her and is pursuing her despite her being in a relationship. A friend called them creepy and threatened to tell the girl unless they stop or confess.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. \n\nFrom what I know, when someone is in a committed relationship, pursuing them romantically can be considered wrong because it's not respecting their commitment. Even if the author and the girl were close friends and had mutual positive feelings, the fact that she's with someone else complicates things. The author might be interpreting friendly interactions as romantic signals, but the girl has already chosen a partner. \n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend doesn't like them and is probably insecure. This could mean the boyfriend feels threatened, which isn't the author's problem to solve, but the main issue is the author's actions towards the girl. By continuing to pursue her while she's in a relationship, the author is being persistent in a way that could be seen as disrespectful or even harassing. \n\nEven though the author claims they love the friendship and the time spent together, the act of pursuing a relationship with someone who is already in one is generally frowned upon. The friend's reaction of calling them creepy and threatening to expose the feelings suggests that others see the behavior as inappropriate. \n\nThe key point is whether pursuing a relationship with someone who is in a relationship is acceptable. In most social norms, it's not considered right because it disregards the other person's commitment. The author's belief that there's still hope might be misplaced if the girl is already in a relationship. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're pursuing a relationship with someone who is already committed, which is generally considered inappropriate.\n"
