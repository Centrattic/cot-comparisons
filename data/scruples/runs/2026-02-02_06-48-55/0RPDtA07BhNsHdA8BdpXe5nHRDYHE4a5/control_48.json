She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been spending time with a girl who has a boyfriend. The boyfriend looks like the author, and the author thought they were developing a relationship but then found out she's already dating someone else. He stopped talking to her for a few days, then reached out again, and now his friend is calling him creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was friends with the girl all year, thought they had potential, but she was already in a relationship. The fact that her boyfriend looks like the author is interesting. The author is now continuing to pursue her despite her being in a relationship. The friend's reaction suggests that this behavior is problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, pursuing someone who's already in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can be seen as disrespectful to the current partner. The author might be under the impression that the girl is interested in him romantically, but since she's with someone else, even if they have a close friendship, continuing to express romantic interest could lead to complications. The author's friend is concerned enough to threaten telling the girl, which implies that the actions are overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he loves the girl and their friendship, but after finding out about the boyfriend, he still wants to keep spending time with her. The boyfriend's disapproval and possible insecurity might be valid reasons for the girl to be in a committed relationship, so the author's persistence could be causing issues between them. The confusion here is whether the author's actions were just innocent friendship or if they crossed into pursuing territory. Since the author thought they were \"moving towards a relationship\" but the girl was already dating someone else, it's possible he misread the signals. However, even if he did, continuing to pursue her after she's in a relationship is where the mistake lies. The friend's warning is a red flag that the author's behavior isn't appropriate, so he should probably stop to avoid complicating the girl's relationship and respecting her current commitment. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
