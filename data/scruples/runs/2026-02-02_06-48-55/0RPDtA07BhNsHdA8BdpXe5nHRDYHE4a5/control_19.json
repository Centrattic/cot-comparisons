She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. They've been hanging out a lot, and the author feels like they were moving towards a relationship. Then they find out the girl is dating someone who looks similar to them. The author is hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then resumes the friendship. Another friend calls them creepy for continuing to pursue the girl despite her being in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the girl is in a committed relationship. Even if the author felt a connection, the key point is that she's already with someone else. Pursuing someone who is in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can lead to emotional harm for all parties involved. The author might think they have a chance because they were close friends, but the girl's choice to be with someone else, even if he looks similar, is her decision. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure about the author doesn't change the fact that the author is still pursuing a taken woman.\n\nAlso, the friend who called the author creepy and threatened to tell the girl about their feelings is another red flag. The author's actions are making others uncomfortable, which adds to the problem. Even if the author claims they want to maintain the friendship, continuing to pursue someone in a relationship can cross boundaries and be seen as disrespectful to the girl's current relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is indeed in the wrong for pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship. It's not about whether the girl reciprocates feelings but about respecting her current commitments. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
