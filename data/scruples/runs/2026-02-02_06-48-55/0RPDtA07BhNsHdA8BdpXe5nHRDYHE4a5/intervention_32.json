She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's been spending a lot of time with a girl who he thought was developing feelings for him, but then he finds out she's already in a relationship with someone who looks similar. He was happy with her, got hurt when he found out, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect. Now his friend is calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl about his feelings unless he stops.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that the girl is already in a committed relationship. The author was pursuing her romantically without knowing about her boyfriend. Even if they were spending time together and had good vibes, if she's in a relationship, the author's actions could be considered inappropriate. The fact that her boyfriend looks like him is interesting, but that doesn't change the fact that the girl is taken. The author's behavior might come across as trying to interfere with someone else's relationship, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nAlso, the author's friend is warning him to stop because he's being creepy. That's a red flag. When someone is persistent in pursuing someone who is in a relationship, especially after being told to stop, it can be seen as harassment. The author might not realize that the girl's interest in him isn't genuine if she's already committed to someone else. Even if she was leading him on, the responsibility is on the author to check if she's available before pursuing a relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional harm. The author was hurt when he found out, but his actions could also be causing emotional distress to the girl and her boyfriend. The boyfriend's disapproval is another sign that the author's presence might be complicating their relationship. \n\nSo, in summary, the author is likely in the wrong because he pursued a girl who is in a relationship, didn't seek to confirm her availability, and continued despite warnings from a friend. His actions could be seen as crossing boundaries and being disrespectful to her current relationship.\n"
