She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for pursuing a girl who they know is already in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the user and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The user got the impression they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's with someone else who looks similar to him. He was hurt and stopped talking to her, then reached out again. The problem is that she's in a relationship, so pursuing her while she's with someone else is the main issue here.\n\nThe key points are: he continued to pursue her even after knowing she's in a relationship. The other girl's friend called him creepy for not stopping. Relationships are about mutual consent and respect. If she's in a relationship, continuing to show interest is unethical because it could be seen as trying to interfere. Even if he thought there was a connection, she's already committed to someone else. The user's actions might be making the boyfriend uncomfortable, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nThe user's argument is that he still loves her and wants to maintain the friendship. But the girlfriend's boyfriend's discomfort is a result of his pursuit. Also, the friend threatened to tell the girl about his feelings. The user's belief that there's still hope might not be valid because she's in a relationship. The question is whether he's wrong for continuing to pursue her despite that. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, respecting other people's relationships is important. So, the user is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who's already in a committed relationship, which is generally considered wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
