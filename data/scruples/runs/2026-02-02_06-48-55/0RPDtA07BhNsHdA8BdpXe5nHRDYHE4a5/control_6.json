She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's been hanging out with a girl since the school year started. He thought they were moving towards a relationship, but then found out she's already dating someone else who looks like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her, then tried to reconnect. Now his friend is calling him creepy and threatening to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the girl already has a boyfriend. The author didn't know about the boyfriend initially and thought they were developing a relationship. But once he found out, he continued to pursue her despite her being in a committed relationship. Even though he tried to reconnect and says he loves their friendship, the fact remains that he's pursuing someone who is already in a relationship. That's a classic case of being in the wrong because you can't pursue someone who's not available. \n\nThe fact that the boyfriend is similar in appearance might make the author feel like he has a chance, but that doesn't justify pursuing a relationship with someone who's already taken. The author's friend calling him creepy is a red flag. The author's actions are inappropriate because he's ignoring the social norms of respecting someone's current relationship. Even if he thought there was mutual attraction or a budding relationship, once the reality is known, continuing to pursue is wrong. \n\nAlso, the author says he loves their relationship and friendship, but if the girl is in a relationship, maintaining that friendship while expressing romantic feelings is complicating things. The author should respect her relationship and step back. The fact that the boyfriend is insecure about him doesn't justify the author's actions. The right thing is to stop pursuing and instead focus on being a friend if that's acceptable without romantic overtures. \n\nSo, yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
