She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. The situation is that they've been hanging out since the school year started, and the guy thought they were moving towards a relationship because she was sweet and they had fun together. Then he found out she's dating someone who looks just like him, which made him feel hurt. He stopped talking to her for a few days but then decided to reach out again. Now, his friend called him creepy and warned him to stop or else she'd tell the girl.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girl is already in a relationship. The author is pursuing her despite that. Even if they had a close friendship, once it's established she's with someone else, continuing to pursue her could be considered wrong. The guy's feelings are understandable\u2014he's hurt and maybe felt rejected. But the key point is the ethical aspect of pursuing someone who isn't single. Relationships are exclusive, so continuing to show romantic interest when she's with someone else is inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the boyfriend might be insecure, but that doesn't justify his actions. The boyfriend's feelings aren't the main issue here. The main problem is the author's persistence. Even if he believes there's hope, it's not respectful to the girl's current relationship. The friend calling him creepy is a sign that his actions are crossing a line. \n\nHe might think the relationship is on shaky ground because of the similar-looking boyfriend, but that's not his place to judge or interfere. The right thing would be to step back and respect her relationship. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for continuing to pursue someone who's already in a relationship, regardless of his feelings or past interactions.\n"
