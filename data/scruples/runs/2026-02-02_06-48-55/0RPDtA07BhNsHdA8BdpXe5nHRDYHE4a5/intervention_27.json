She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The story goes that they've been hanging out since the start of the school year, and he really liked her, thought she was perfect. They had a lot of fun and he felt like they were moving towards a relationship. Then he found out she's dating a guy in their dorm who looks a lot like him. He was hurt, stopped talking to her for a few days, but then reached out again because he loves their friendship and the time together. Now another friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he doesn't come clean or stop. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nAlright, so the key points here are: the guy is pursuing a girl who's already in a relationship. Even though they were friends and had a connection, once he found out she's dating someone else, continuing to pursue her could be problematic. \n\nFrom what I know about relationships and social norms, if someone is in a relationship, it's generally expected that you don't pursue them romantically. Even if the person is your friend and you both have feelings, but they're already with someone else, trying to start a relationship would be considered inappropriate. The guy here says he's still hanging out with her, and the boyfriend doesn't like him, which is a red flag. The fact that the friend called him creepy and told him to stop suggests that his actions are overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, the guy mentions that he felt they were moving towards a relationship, but maybe he misread her signals. Just because she spends time with him and says nice things doesn't mean she's looking to be in a relationship with him. Since she's already in a relationship, pursuing her could be seen as trying to interfere or be a third wheel. Even if he's trying to be friendly, continuing to show romantic interest when she's with someone else is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's pursuing someone who is already in a relationship. The right thing to do would be to respect her current relationship and either be friends or step back. Continuing to pursue her despite knowing she's with someone else is unethical and could be hurtful to both the girl and her boyfriend.\n"
