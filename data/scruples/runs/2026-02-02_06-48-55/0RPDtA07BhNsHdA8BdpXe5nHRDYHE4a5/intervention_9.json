She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. The author feels like they were moving towards a relationship, with the girl showing positive attention. Then the author finds out the girl is dating someone who looks similar to him. He's hurt and stops talking to her for a few days but then reaches out again. Now, he's continuing to interact with her even though she's in a relationship. A friend called him creepy and threatened to tell the girl if he doesn't stop.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is: is it wrong to pursue someone who's already in a relationship? The author believes there's hope, but the girl has a boyfriend. Even if there was mutual positive feelings before, once the relationship is known, continuing to pursue her could be seen as inappropriate. The boyfriend's disapproval adds another layer, but the key issue is the existing relationship. The author's actions might be interfering with someone else's committed relationship, which is generally considered wrong. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's behavior is indeed problematic. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
