She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. Let's break down the situation. \n\nFirst, the girl and the author have been hanging out a lot since the school year started. She's described as fun, beautiful, etc., and he feels like they're moving towards a relationship. He mentions she texted him to hang out, and he felt happy. Then he finds out she's dating someone who looks like him, which he interprets as her being attracted to him. He's hurt, stops talking to her for a few days, then reaches out again. Now he's trying to maintain the friendship despite her boyfriend's disapproval. His friend calls him creepy and threatens to tell the girl if he doesn't stop or come clean.\n\nSo the main points here are: he's pursuing a girl who's in a relationship. Even if he thinks there's some mutual feelings or chemistry, the fact remains she has a boyfriend. Pursuing someone while they are in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it can break trust and cause emotional harm. The author's actions could be seen as disrespecting her current relationship. Even if he wasn't aware she was dating someone at first, once he knew, continuing to pursue her would be problematic. He's trying to maintain the friendship while still being emotionally involved, which might make him look like he's not respecting her partner's feelings. The friend's comment about him being creepy and threatening to expose his feelings suggests that others see his behavior as inappropriate. \n\nHe might argue that the girl led him on by being friendly and texting him, but that doesn't justify his pursuit. The fact that the girl is in a relationship means that any further emotional or romantic engagement from the author is unethical. He's not in the wrong if he's unaware she's dating someone, but once he knows, continuing to pursue her would be wrong. So the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because he's aware of her relationship and still pursues her.\n"
