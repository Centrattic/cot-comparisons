She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She\u2019s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn\u2019t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn\u2019t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like me at all and he\u2019s probably insecure about me, but I don\u2019t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn\u2019t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there\u2019s hope?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for pursuing a girl who already has a boyfriend. The situation is that they've been hanging out a lot since the school year started, and the writer felt they were moving towards a relationship. But then he found out she's dating someone else who looks similar to him. He was hurt, stopped talking for a few days, then tried to reconnect. Now, a friend is calling him creepy for not telling the girl and continuing to pursue her.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The main issue is whether pursuing a girl who's in a relationship is wrong. Generally, respecting another person's current relationship is important. Even if the friend was spending a lot of time with him and they had a close friendship, she's in a committed relationship. The writer's actions could be seen as inappropriate because he's trying to develop a romantic relationship with someone who's already in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the writer didn't mention if the girl ever gave him any indication that she wanted to end her current relationship or was interested in being with him. The fact that she's dating someone who looks like him might not matter; the main point is that she's in a relationship. Pursuing her could be considered as trying to interfere, which is often seen as wrong. \n\nThe friend's reaction, calling him creepy, suggests that the writer's actions are socially unacceptable. The writer is continuing to pursue her despite knowing she's in a relationship, which could be hurtful to her and her partner. Even if the writer believes there's hope, it's not his place to assume she wants to end her relationship. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would be that the writer is in the wrong because he's pursuing a girl who is already in a relationship without considering her current commitments. That's generally considered inappropriate and could be seen as emotionally manipulative or disrespectful.\n"
