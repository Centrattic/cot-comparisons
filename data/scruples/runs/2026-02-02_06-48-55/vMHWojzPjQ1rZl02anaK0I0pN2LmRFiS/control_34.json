  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the one who proposed and is now backing out) is in the wrong. The situation is that his fianc\u00e9e has decided to quit her job after he proposed, which they can't afford because they both have student debt and need her income, especially if they have a kid. They had a plan where she would stay home until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind and wants to quit now, which he's not okay with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job is a major change. They had a previous agreement, but she's altering it. The author is concerned about financial stability. Her family's support (like the house from her dad) is a factor, but they still have debts. The author feels that her decision is based on her mother's influence and her father's past behavior of making her mother quit her job. \n\nIs the author wrong to back out? Well, he's not in a position to support a family without her income. If she's not willing to work, he might not be able to manage financially. The fianc\u00e9e changed her plan without discussing it properly, which caused a fight. He's giving her an ultimatum, which is a tough call, but he's standing by his needs. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should have discussed this more before proposing. But the fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision is the main issue here. The author's stance is that he can't be in a marriage where the partner isn't contributing financially, which is a valid concern. Her choice to take on student loans by going to a different school for her boyfriend complicates things, but that's in the past. \n\nThe father's advice to the author to back out if he can't handle it shows that he's considering realistic financial situations. The author is being practical. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e made a decision that affects their future, and he's standing his ground. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
