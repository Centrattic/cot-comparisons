Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is that his fianc\u00e9e quit her job after the proposal, which was unexpected. They had planned for her to work until the kid starts pre-K, but she now wants to stay home indefinitely. They have financial issues\u2014both have student loans and couldn't afford a house without her dad's help. The author feels they need her income to support a future child and their debts. He's considering an ultimatum: work or no marriage.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side, as presented, is that her father (who's wealthy) told her mom to quit her job when they married. She grew up seeing that model, so she expects the same when married. She went to a local college because of her ex-boyfriend, leading to debt. Now, she wants to follow her mom's example and not work, possibly influenced by her mother's support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author is concerned about financial stability. Marriage is a partnership, and both parties should discuss expectations. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the proposal, which the author didn't anticipate. However, the author is acting in his own financial interest, which is valid. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel her decision is based on her upbringing and personal choice. \n\nBut here's the key: the author proposed, and after the proposal, she made a unilateral decision that affects their future. They had a prior plan, which she's now changing. The author has the right to reconsider if their expectations are not met. He's not forcing her to work; he's choosing not to proceed if her decision doesn't align with their shared financial reality. \n\nThe father's comment that there shouldn't be bad feelings if the author backs out suggests he sees the financial aspect as a deal-breaker. The author isn't in the wrong for recognizing that their life plans are incompatible. He's not being selfish; he's addressing practical realities. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit without discussing it more thoroughly could be the issue. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
