  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nThe author proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but she suddenly quits her job, planning not to work anymore after marriage. They both have significant student debt and can't afford to live on his income alone, especially with plans to have a child. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her dad was successful, and he made her mom quit her job too. Now she's following that example, but the author can't support the family on his own like her dad could. They had a plan to have her work part-time after the kid starts school, but she's changed her mind.\n\nThe author is torn between backing out of the engagement or forcing her to work. He's considering an ultimatum but feels it might not be healthy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Let's look at both sides. The author's main concern is financial stability. They need her income to support a family, especially with debt and future child. He's not in a position like her father, so relying on her income is necessary. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is following her mother's example, possibly expecting financial support from the author, which he can't provide. She also chose a cheaper school over a better one, which led to more debt. But she might feel it's her right to stop working after marriage, especially since her family's example shows that.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility angle, the author is right to be concerned. He can't afford to support a family on his own. Her decision to leave her job without discussing the finances might be seen as careless. However, maybe she feels entitled to not work because of her family's wealth, and the author isn't in the same financial situation. The author is trying to be realistic about their circumstances, while she's following a different model.\n\nBut the key here is that they had a plan. They thought about having a child and agreed on her working part-time afterward. If she changed her mind without discussing it, that's a problem. The author is justified in feeling betrayed because they had a mutual plan. Her decision to quit her job without considering their financial needs undermines their agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being too rigid. Marriage is about compromise, and expecting her to work might be a burden. But given their financial situation, it's necessary. The author isn't forcing her to work, but he's standing by his decision to not marry her unless she works. That's his right, as he can't support them on his own. \n\nHer family's influence might play a role here. If her mom and dad set that precedent, she might not realize the financial implications for the author. But the author has to prioritize his own ability to support the family. It's not about being in the wrong; it's about being realistic. He's not at fault for wanting to secure their future. She might be in the wrong for changing her mind without considering their financial needs. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their circumstances. Answer B.\n"
