Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (he) is 28, she's 26. They've been dating 3.5 years. They both have significant student loan debt. Her dad gave them a house, but otherwise they can't afford it. He proposed, and she then quit her job, which surprised him because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. Her reasoning is similar to her mom's situation, where her dad told her mom to quit. Now she wants to be a stay-at-home wife, but he can't support that financially.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side, he's in a financial situation where he can't support a family without her income. They had a plan that she would work until pre-K, then maybe part-time. Now she's changed her mind, and he feels this is a dealbreaker. He's considering an ultimatum, which is tough, but he's trying to be realistic about their financial situation.\n\nFrom her side, she might feel that after being engaged, it's reasonable to step back from work to focus on marriage and family, especially if inspired by her mother's example. She comes from a wealthy family, so maybe she expects financial support. However, the author's financial situation doesn't allow that, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's making a practical decision based on their financial reality. He's not forcing her to work, but he can't proceed with marriage if she won't work. He's also not happy with the ultimatum but sees it as necessary. \n\nOn the flip side, she made a significant life decision (quitting her job) after the proposal, which caused a major conflict. Maybe she didn't consider the impact on their plans. Her expectations might be out of alignment with his ability to meet them. \n\nThe father-in-law is level-headed and supports the author's decision to back out if needed. The mother-in-law is fully behind her, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have valid points. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability, especially when they have significant debt. She might be wrong for changing her stance after agreeing to the previous plan. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's choosing not to marry her because her decision makes financial sense, he's making a practical choice. However, an ultimatum in a relationship is a serious matter. But given their circumstances, maybe he's justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because he's making a realistic assessment of their financial situation and standing by his needs.\n"
