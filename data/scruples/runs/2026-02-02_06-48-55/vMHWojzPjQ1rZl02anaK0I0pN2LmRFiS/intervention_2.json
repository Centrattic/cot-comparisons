Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but she quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker. He's upset because they need her income to support them, especially with plans to have a kid soon. The main issue is whether he's wrong for backing out of the engagement because she won't work anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they have significant debt and can't afford to live on his income alone. He values financial stability and doesn't want to rely on her father's wealth. He had a plan where she would reduce her work after having a kid, but she's changing plans now. He's giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. He's worried about the healthiness of a marriage based on an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e grew up in a wealthy family where her father encouraged her to quit her job. She might feel entitled to be a homemaker, especially given her background. She might not have considered the financial implications because her father supported her family's needs. Her mother's influence could also play a role in her decision. She might believe that her financial situation is secure because of her father's support, even though the author isn't in the same position.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss their financial plans before engagement? The author mentions they had a plan for her to reduce work after a child, but now she's changed her mind. Did he express concerns about their financial situation earlier? If they had those conversations upfront, maybe this conflict could have been avoided. The author is now reacting to a surprise decision, which could indicate a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe father-in-law is supportive if the author backs out, which adds another layer. The author's decision to give an ultimatum might stem from feeling that the engagement is based on unrealistic expectations. However, using an ultimatum in a relationship can be problematic, as it might not leave room for compromise or understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nConsidering cultural factors might also be relevant. In some cultures, it's common for one spouse to be a homemaker, especially if the other earns a good income. However, in this case, the author isn't in a position to support a family on his own. The fianc\u00e9e's background might influence her expectations, but the author has different financial realities.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e unilaterally changed their agreed-upon plan without considering their financial constraints, she might be at fault. However, the author's response with an ultimatum could also be seen as harsh. Relationships require flexibility and mutual understanding. If the author feels that the marriage can't proceed under these terms, his decision to back out might be justified. On the other hand, if they hadn't fully discussed the long-term plan, both could share some responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's standing up for his financial and practical concerns. However, the situation highlights a miscommunication or mismatch in expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the impact on their shared life is problematic. The author's response, while firm, is a reaction to a significant issue affecting their future together. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
