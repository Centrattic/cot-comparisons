  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author (he) proposed, and the fianc\u00e9e (she) then quits her job. He's shocked because they need her income, especially with their debts and future plans for a kid. She was raised with the idea of the husband supporting the family, similar to her father's model. Her father's wealth allowed her mom to not work, but the author can't support them financially.\n\nHe's giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. He's worried about their financial stability and future family. On the other hand, she might feel that this is her choice, based on her upbringing and her mother's example. Her family's support and the house given by her dad might have influenced her expectations.\n\nIs it fair for him to back out because she won't work? Well, marriage is a partnership, and financial responsibilities are a big part. If they had discussed their future plans and she changed her mind after the proposal, that's a problem. But maybe they hadn't fully discussed her expectations. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's justified.\n\nHe's in a position where their combined income is necessary for their lifestyle and future. If she quits without mutual agreement, that's a significant change. The user might argue that he's being realistic, while others might think he's being controlling. But since they had a plan to eventually have her return to work part-time later, her decision to quit now disrupts that. \n\nHer choice to not work was made unilaterally, which could be a deal-breaker for him. If they can't compromise, then breaking up might be necessary. However, using an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But given their financial situation, maybe it's reasonable for him to not proceed with the marriage under these terms.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. He's standing by his need for both incomes and not being able to support the family alone. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
