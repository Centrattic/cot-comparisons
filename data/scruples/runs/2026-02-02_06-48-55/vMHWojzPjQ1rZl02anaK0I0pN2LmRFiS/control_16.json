Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone who has suddenly decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. The main issue is that they both have significant student loan debt and can't afford to live on just the author's income. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy and made her mother quit her job after marriage, which seems to be influencing her decision. The couple had a plan that she would work part-time after having a kid, but now she wants to stop working altogether.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability. They need her income to support their lifestyle and future plans, including having a child. Financial planning is a big part of marriage, so it's reasonable for him to be worried. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she's entitled to not work after marriage, influenced by her father's example. However, their financial situations are different\u2014her father could support a family, but the author can't.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to proceed with the marriage if she refuses to work. The author isn't saying she should work for financial reasons but is concerned about their ability to sustain the marriage without her income. If she's decided not to work regardless of financial implications, that could lead to future conflict.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the financial impact might be seen as irresponsible. However, the author is also making a choice based on his values and financial reality. It's a mutual decision situation. If she's not willing to compromise on her decision to stop working, then the author is justified in re-evaluating the engagement.\n\nI should also think about the concept of fairness. The author isn't forcing her to work; he's stating his need for both incomes. If she's not willing to meet him halfway, then he's not in the wrong for walking away. The fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to a certain lifestyle, but that's not realistic given their financial situation.\n\nAnother angle is the financial planning aspect. They had a plan for the future that included her working, and she's changing it now. The author is right to point out that if she never intended to use her degree, why take on the debt? That shows a lack of responsibility in her past decisions. However, the author is also holding her accountable for past choices now, which might be unfair, but it's part of the overall picture.\n\nIn terms of ultimatums, the author is considering one, but he's also aware that it might not be healthy. However, if the engagement is based on mutual expectations, and she's not willing to meet those expectations, then walking away isn't the wrong choice. It's about compatibility in life goals.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial realities. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the implications is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
