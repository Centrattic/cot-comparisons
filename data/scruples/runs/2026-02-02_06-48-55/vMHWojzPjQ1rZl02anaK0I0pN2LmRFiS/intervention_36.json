Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and decided not to work after marriage, which they can't afford financially.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The man is 28, she's 26, they've been dating 3.5 years. They have a lot of student debt and couldn't afford a house otherwise. Her father gave them a house, which is a big help. The fianc\u00e9e just quit her job because she wants to be a wife and not work, which causes a conflict because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. \n\nThe man is upset because they had a plan where she would stop working later, after a kid, but now she's changed her mind. Her mother supports her decision, but her father is more level-headed and acknowledges the man shouldn't be in a position to support a family unless he can afford it. \n\nThe man is giving her an ultimatum: work or not marry. The user initially thinks the author (the man) is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. \n\nHmm. So, is the man wrong to back out? Let's consider the dynamics. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job is a significant change in their financial situation. They had a prior agreement, but she's changing her stance now. The man's argument is that they can't survive without her income and that her education (with loans) was for a degree she won't use. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that since her father supported her mother in quitting work when they married, she's following that example. However, their financial circumstances are different from her parents'\u2014her father was wealthy enough to support the family, but the man isn't. \n\nThe man is concerned about their financial stability and future plans. He's not forcing her to work, but he can't support a family without her income. Is it wrong for him to back out? Well, if they can't agree on a path forward, it's understandable he might end the engagement. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job without discussing it with her fianc\u00e9 first might be the issue. They had a plan, and she changed it unilaterally. The man is standing his ground because their financial reality doesn't allow for her to stop working now. \n\nAlso, student loans and debt are a factor. The fianc\u00e9e's choice of college (due to a boyfriend) led to debt, and she might be passing that on to the marriage. But the man is responsible for their joint financial future. \n\nSo, the man's actions are based on financial necessity. He's not forcing her to work, but he can't take on the burden of her not working. The fianc\u00e9e's father even supports the man's decision to back out. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. But considering the financial implications and the prior agreement, the man is acting in their best interest. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability over a traditional gender role. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
