Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that he's engaged to someone who just quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker once they're married. They have a lot of debt and can't afford to live on his income alone. He's considering backing out of the engagement if she won't work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9e grew up in a wealthy family where her father told her mom to quit her job after marriage. Now she's following that example. The author is concerned about their financial situation and their future plans involving children. They had a plan for her to work part-time later, but she's changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author's financial concerns are valid. They both have significant debt and can't afford to live on one income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to leave her job might jeopardize their financial stability. Also, she went to a less prestigious school due to a past relationship, leading to more debt. The author is worried about the future, especially if they have kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might see this as a personal choice. She could feel that after the engagement, she's entitled to be a homemaker, especially with the example set by her mother. Her family's wealth might have influenced her expectations. The author's ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her to work, which might not be fair if she's decided to change her career path.\n\nBut the author is also concerned about their shared financial responsibilities. It's important that both partners contribute, especially when they can't rely on one income. The author isn't just being selfish; he's looking at the practical aspects of their marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's last-minute decision might have broken trust, as they had previously discussed a different plan.\n\nThe father's support in this situation shows that he acknowledges the author's valid concerns. The author is trying to be reasonable, not forcing her to work but stating that he can't commit if she won't. The question is whether this is an ultimatum, but in a marriage, both partners need to agree on major life decisions, including financial ones.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's standing up for their financial realities and the need for mutual contribution. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without discussing the implications shows a lack of consideration for their shared future. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
