Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but she just quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker once they get married. The main issue is that they both have significant student debt, and her income is necessary for their finances, especially if they plan to have a kid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her dad was successful. Her dad told her mom to quit her job when they married, so maybe she expects the same from the author. But the author isn't in the same financial position as her dad. They can't afford to live without her income. They had previously discussed a plan where she might work part-time later, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out because she quit her job. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) here. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong).\n\nSo, the author is saying he can't marry her if she's not going to work. He feels it's unfair because they need her income, and he's not wealthy enough to support a family alone. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, wants to follow the example set by her parents, where the wife doesn't work. Her mom supports this, but the dad seems more reasonable.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the author has a valid concern. They have debt and can't afford to lose her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit could put their financial stability at risk. However, marriage is a partnership, and changing jobs after marriage can be a mutual decision. The fianc\u00e9e might feel she's entitled to not work because of her family background, but the author isn't in the same position.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e also went to a state school instead of a more prestigious one her dad suggested, leading to more debt. The author is upset she took on debt unnecessarily. But he also acknowledges that past decisions can't be changed. The key issue is the current decision to quit work without a plan that aligns with their financial needs.\n\nThe author isn't saying he's angry about past choices but about the present decision. He wants to set a boundary that she continues to work. If she won't, he's backing out. That's a tough choice, but he's prioritizing financial stability. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is that she wants to be a homemaker, which is a personal choice, but it's conflicting with their financial reality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a way, he's standing his ground on a financial necessity. However, maybe there's a compromise. But the question is about whether he's the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e might feel he's not respecting her choice, but he's also not in a position to support her financially as her dad did. The father's support for the author's decision if he backs out suggests that this isn't an easy situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible choice based on their financial situation. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the financial impact could be seen as the problem here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
