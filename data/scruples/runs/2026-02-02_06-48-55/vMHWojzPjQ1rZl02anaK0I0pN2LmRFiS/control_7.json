Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a man who's engaged to a woman who has decided to quit her job because she wants to be a housewife after marriage. The key points here are their financial situation, the woman's decision to quit, and the man's reaction.\n\nFirst, the man proposed, and the woman then put in her two weeks' notice. The man is upset because they need her income to survive, especially since they have student debt and plan to have a kid. He's not in a position to support a family alone like her father could. They had previously discussed a plan where she would work for a few years post-kid and then return part-time. But she's now changing her mind, and her mom supports her, while her dad is more level-headed and even tells the man it's okay if he backs out.\n\nSo, the man is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or don't get married. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to base the marriage on an ultimatum but also can't support the family on his income alone.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The woman's decision to quit her job is a significant change. They had prior plans, but she's altering them after the proposal. Financial stability is a big factor here. The man's concern is valid because their financial situation wouldn't support her not working. He's not asking her to do something she's unhappy with, but it's about practicality. \n\nIs the man wrong for wanting her to work? Well, the woman has a right to choose her life, but the man has a right to be in a marriage that he can financially sustain. The woman might feel entitled to be a homemaker because of her father's example, but the man isn't in the same financial position. The woman's decision could be seen as self-centered, especially since they had prior agreements and she's changing her mind after the proposal. \n\nThe man's response is to consider backing out of the engagement to avoid a financially unstable marriage. That seems like a responsible decision. He's not forcing her to work, but he's choosing not to proceed with the marriage if she can't contribute financially. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the woman should have this choice, and the man is being too pragmatic. But given their debt and the need for her income, the man's stance is understandable. The father is even supportive if the man backs out, which adds weight to the idea that the man isn't in the wrong here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
