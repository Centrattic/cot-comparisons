Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's engaged to someone who suddenly quit her job because she wants to be a housewife now that they're engaged. He's upset because they can't afford to live without her income, especially if they have a kid. They have a lot of student loan debt, and he doesn't make enough to support both of them and pay off the debt. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family, her dad helped them out with a house, and she didn't take the \"real school\" option which would have avoided student loans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is financial responsibility. They need her income to survive. If she quits, their financial situation becomes unsustainable. He's also questioning why she took out loans if she didn't plan to use her degree. That's a valid concern because taking on debt without a plan can be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that marriage should allow her to focus on being a wife and future mother, similar to her mother's example. She might see her decision as practical for child-rearing, even if it's not financially feasible right now. Her father's support might have given her the impression that she can rely on family money. However, the author isn't in a position to support her financially, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe key points are about financial responsibilities in marriage and mutual expectations. The author is setting boundaries based on his financial reality, which is understandable. He's not forcing her to work, but he's acknowledging that without her income, their current life isn't sustainable. The fianc\u00e9e changed her plan without discussing it thoroughly, which led to a major conflict. \n\nThe author's father-in-law is supportive of the author's decision to back out, which adds another layer. The author is trying to find a middle ground but realizes that an ultimatum might not be healthy for the relationship. However, he's also being realistic about their financial constraints. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability. Marriage requires both partners to be on the same page, and if one partner's decision to quit a job contradicts the other's financial needs, it's a valid reason to reconsider the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might be selfish in this context, as it's causing financial instability. \n\nSo, the author is in the right for making a decision based on their financial reality. He's not forcing her to work, but he's recognizing that her choice to leave her job makes marriage impractical. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
