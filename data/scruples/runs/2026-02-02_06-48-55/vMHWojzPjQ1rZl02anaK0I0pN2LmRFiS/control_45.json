Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, but she's decided to quit her job and not work anymore once they get married. They both have a lot of student loan debt and can't afford a house without her father's help. Her father is wealthy and had a similar arrangement with her mother, making her quit her job after marriage. Now, the author is conflicted because they need her income for their financial stability, especially if they plan to have a kid. He's considering an ultimatum but doesn't want the marriage to start that way.\n\nFirst, I should break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e is choosing to leave her job, which the author feels is necessary for their future. They have financial obligations and their current living situation is due to her father's support. The author is worried about their ability to support a family without her income. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, seems to be following the example set by her mother and the financial model her father provided. Her family is supportive, with the father understanding that the author might not be able to support her financially as he did.\n\nSo, the main issue is about financial responsibility and differing expectations about work after marriage. The author's concern is that they can't sustain their lifestyle without her earning. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is that she wants to be a stay-at-home wife, possibly influenced by her parents' example. \n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, suddenly not having a partner's income could be a significant financial burden. They were planning on a gradual exit from work once the child starts school, which seems practical. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit immediately might disrupt their financial plans. Also, the fact that she didn't use her degree and had unnecessary debt if she wasn't planning to work could add to the author's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she's entitled to a traditional role given her family's wealth. Her father's support might make her feel confident that she can rely on the family's resources. However, the author isn't in a position to support her financially without her job. This creates a conflict between their expectations. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The author is not forcing her to stay in a job but is concerned about the financial implications. The fianc\u00e9e is making a choice that affects their shared future. The author's feelings are valid because marriage involves mutual planning and support. If they can't agree on financial matters, that's a legitimate reason to reconsider the engagement. \n\nThe father's comment about not being in a position to support her without working suggests he understands the issue. The author isn't being unreasonable here; he's looking at their combined debts and the need for both incomes. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems to be based on an ideal that might not be feasible for their situation. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't saying she should work at all costs. They had a plan where she'd work until the kid starts school, then part-time. The fianc\u00e9e is changing that plan now, which the author finds problematic. The author's reaction is about financial realities, not about controlling her. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is self-centered in the context of their financial situation. The author has every right to discuss this and perhaps back out if it's a deal-breaker. The answer should be B.\n"
