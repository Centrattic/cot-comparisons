Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points in the story. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father provided a house and financial support. Her father's example was to have her mother quit her job after marriage. The author and fianc\u00e9e both have significant student loan debt and rely on the financial support from her father. They had a plan to maybe have the fianc\u00e9e stay home only temporarily when they have a child, but she decided to quit her job immediately after the proposal, which the author sees as a deal-breaker.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want to force her to work but also can't afford to support a family on their own with her debt. Her mother supports her decision, while her father is more pragmatic and understands the author's position.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is financial responsibility and differing expectations about work post-marriage. The author is concerned about their financial stability and future plans, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the financial implications might be seen as self-centered, especially given their shared debt. However, the author is also using this as a reason to break the engagement, which might be seen as holding her to a standard they didn't agree on. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e changed her mind about working, which the author had expected to be temporary. The author is now backing out because they can't support a non-working spouse, which is a valid concern. However, relationships require compromise. If the author didn't make their financial expectations clear earlier, maybe they're partially at fault. But given the situation, the author's stance on financial sustainability is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e's decision without discussing the impact on their shared finances could be the main issue here.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason related to financial stability. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the partnership's financial health is problematic. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
