  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who's breaking off an engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after marriage, which the author feels is necessary for financial stability.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e's background: her father is wealthy and told her mom to quit her job when they got married. Now, the author and fianc\u00e9e are both in their late 20s, have significant student debt, and can't afford a house without her dad's help. The fianc\u00e9e just quit her job because she wants to be a stay-at-home wife, but the author argues that they need her income, especially since they plan to have a kid soon. They had a plan to have her work part-time after the kid starts pre-K, but now she wants to quit entirely after the engagement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and the reality of their current situation. They can't support both their debts and a family without her income. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her financial independence isn't necessary if her family can support her, following the example set by her father. She might also feel that the author isn't supportive of her desire to stay home, especially if they had discussed a different plan before.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and communication. The author mentions they had a plan that she changed without considering their financial constraints. If they had discussed this earlier, maybe they could have found a middle ground. But since she changed her mind after the engagement, the author is justified in reconsidering the marriage, especially since it's a major life decision that affects both partners' well-being. The fianc\u00e9e's decision could lead to financial instability, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the author is also in a position where they don't have the financial resources to support a family on their own. It's not about being wealthy but about practicality. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit her job might be impulsive, not considering the author's ability to support them. The father's advice to back out if the author can't support himself is also a point to consider. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both need to compromise. The author isn't wrong to prioritize financial stability, especially given their debts. The fianc\u00e9e changing her stance after agreeing to a different plan might be the issue here. The author's ultimatum is about realigning expectations, which is reasonable if they can't meet in the middle. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9e's decision without considering the financial implications and changing plans after agreement might be the problem. The author is acting in their own and their future family's best interest.\n"
