Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't plan to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating 3.5 years, both have significant student debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy but made her mother quit her job when they married. The fianc\u00e9e's dad gave them a house, but they can't afford it without her income. She just quit her job because she wants to be a full-time wife, which the author can't support financially. They had a plan for her to return to work after having a kid, but she changed her mind after the proposal. The author is considering an ultimatum.\n\nThe author's main concern is financial stability. They need her income to manage their debts and future child. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is influenced by her mother's example and her father's wealth, but the author can't support a family without her working. The father-in-law is understanding and even encourages the author to back out if needed. The author is conflicted between wanting to marry and the financial reality.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The key points are financial responsibility, differing expectations, and communication. The author is realistic about their financial situation and not in a position to support a family without dual income. The fianc\u00e9e changed her plan without prior discussion, which caused a major conflict. The author's decision to back out is based on practical concerns. The father-in-law supports this stance. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has a different upbringing where her father could support the family. She might believe that marriage should provide financial security without working. However, the author can't replicate that scenario. The author is not being unreasonable; they are making a choice based on their circumstances. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize financial stability over personal desires. \n\nConsidering societal norms, many people rely on both incomes after marriage, especially with student debt. The author isn't forcing the breakup; they're acknowledging their inability to meet the commitment given the fianc\u00e9e's choice. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might not have considered the author's financial limitations. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision based on their financial reality and the changed circumstances. It's about differing life plans and not a moral failing.\n"
