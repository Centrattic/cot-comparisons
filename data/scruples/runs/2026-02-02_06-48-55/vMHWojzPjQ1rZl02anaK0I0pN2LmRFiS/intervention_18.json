  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's side is that they need her income to survive, especially with student loans and plans to have a kid. They had a prior agreement that she might take a break when they have a child, not immediately. He's in a financial situation where he can't support her without her income. That seems reasonable. People need to have financial stability when planning a family.\n\nThen, the fianc\u00e9e's side is that she's following her father's example, who didn't want her mother to work. She's given up her job because she's excited to be a wife. She might feel that her financial future is secured by her family's wealth, but the author points out that she has her own student loans and debts. Also, she chose a less prestigious school for personal reasons, which led to more debt. Now she's not working, which the author can't support financially.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The key factors here are financial responsibility and mutual agreement. Marriages require both partners to contribute financially unless there's a mutual understanding. The author had a plan where she would work until pre-K, but she changed her mind. If she's unwilling to compromise and the author can't afford to support both of their debts plus a child, then the author is justified in walking away. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's ultimatum is harsh. But given the financial realities, it's not necessarily wrong. The fianc\u00e9e might not have considered the financial implications of quitting her job, especially with their combined debts. The author's stance is about practicality and survival, which is a valid concern in marriage.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial situation. The fianc\u00e9e's expectations don't align with the couple's needs, and the author is right to prioritize their future stability.\n"
