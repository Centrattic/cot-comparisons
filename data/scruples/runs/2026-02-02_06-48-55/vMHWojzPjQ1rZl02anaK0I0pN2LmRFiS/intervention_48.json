Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work anymore after getting engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e quit her job, expecting to be a homemaker. The author is upset because they both have student debt, they need her income, and they plan to have a kid soon. The fianc\u00e9e's family, especially her father, has a history of supporting women financially, like her mother did. The fianc\u00e9e's mother had a fairy-tale scenario where she didn't work, but the author can't support that lifestyle. The fianc\u00e9e's father is more level-headed and even supports the author backing out if he's not in a good financial position.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and differing expectations. The author feels that the engagement is based on a financial plan that includes both their incomes. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her parents' experiences, expects her income to stop, which the author can't handle. The author is considering an ultimatum, which could be seen as harsh, but he's also worried about their future financial stability.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his financial reality. He can't support a family without her income, especially with their debts. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which might be the bigger issue. The author isn't forcing her to work; he's expressing that he can't commit if she won't work. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might have been impulsive and not discussed properly. The author's father-in-law even supports his decision to back out if needed.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this earlier. But given the circumstances, he's trying to be responsible. The fianc\u00e9e's mom's expectations and her own decision to quit without considering their financial situation could be the root problem. The author is being realistic about their combined financial situation. So, I think the author is not in the wrong.\n"
