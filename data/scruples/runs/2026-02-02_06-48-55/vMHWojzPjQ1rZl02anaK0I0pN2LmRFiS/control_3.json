Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who's backing out of an engagement because the other person decided to quit their job and not work after marriage. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple is in their late 20s, both have significant student debt, and they have a house given by her wealthy father. The fianc\u00e9e (the woman) has decided to quit her job now that they're engaged, which the author is against because they need her income. The woman's dad was similar, making her mom quit her job when they married. The author had a plan where she would take a break during the child's early years and then return part-time, but she's now not planning to work at all. The author is considering an ultimatum: work or no marriage.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, differing expectations about work post-marriage, and the influence of family dynamics. The author is concerned about their financial stability without her income. The woman, influenced by her mother's example and her father's wealth, wants to be a full-time homemaker. The author feels this was a surprise and not discussed properly, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author is standing by his financial reality and the plan they discussed. The woman changed her mind without prior discussion, which might have caught the author off guard. However, the author is now considering an ultimatum, which could be seen as a valid stance to protect their shared financial future. Alternatively, maybe the author should have addressed this earlier in the relationship.\n\nBut considering that they had a prior plan (3-4 years before having a kid), and the woman changed her mind after engagement, the author is justified in reevaluating. The woman's decision could be impractical given their financial situation. The author isn't wrong for wanting to proceed with a plan they discussed. However, using an ultimatum might be harsh, but the question is whether being in the wrong applies. Since the author is acting to protect their shared financial stability, they might not be in the wrong. The woman's decision is causing a conflict, but the author's response is based on realistic financial concerns. So, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
