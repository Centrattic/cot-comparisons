Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to back out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't plan to work anymore after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy and had her mother quit her job after they married. The couple has student debt and can't afford a house without her father's help. The author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e quit her job, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. They had a plan where she would stay home for a few years after having a kid, then return part-time. But she changed her mind and now wants to quit entirely. The author is considering an ultimatum: work or no marriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The core issue is about financial responsibility and differing expectations. The author is concerned about their financial stability without her income. They need her job to support them, especially when planning a child. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her mother's example, thinks she should be a stay-at-home wife. But their financial situation isn't as strong as her father's was. The author feels betrayed because they had a prior agreement, and now she's changing her mind. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to marry someone who won't contribute financially? The fianc\u00e9e's decision affects their ability to manage debt and future plans. The author is prioritizing financial security, which is understandable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel she has the right to choose not to work after marriage, based on her family's example. However, the author's circumstances are different from her father's. \n\nLegally, neither is in the wrong, but morally? The author is standing up for their own needs and the practical realities. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without considering their financial constraints. The author isn't being selfish; they're addressing a critical issue that affects their future. The ultimatum is a hard choice, but it's about compatibility. If they can't agree on this major life decision, continuing the engagement might lead to more conflict. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a rational decision based on their financial situation. The fianc\u00e9e's actions are creating a problem that impacts their shared future, and the author is taking responsibility for their own needs.\n"
