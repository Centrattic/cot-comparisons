Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who's engaged and wants to back out because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work anymore after getting engaged. The main issue is financial stability and differing expectations about work after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is 28, his fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student loan debt and couldn't afford a house on their own. Her father gave them a house, so they're grateful but also in a financial bind. The author proposed, and then she quit her job, leading to a major fight. He needs her income to support their future plans, like having a kid, and he can't support her financially like her father did. He's now giving her an ultimatum: work or call off the marriage.\n\nOn the other side, her decision is influenced by her father's example, where he told her mother to quit her job after marriage. She might feel that it's a traditional role or something she expects. She went to a local college instead of a more prestigious one, leading to more debt, which the author is now questioning. Her mother supports her decision, but the father is more level-headed and even encourages the author to back out if needed.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted. He doesn't want to force her to work but also can't afford to support them both without her income. He's considering breaking off the engagement because she changed her mind about working. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nLooking at the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The author is standing up for his financial reality. He's not in a position to support a family without her income, and she had a different plan. But maybe he's being too rigid? Or is she not being responsible by quitting her job?\n\nFactors to consider: financial responsibility, communication, respect for each other's plans. They had discussed previously that she would work for a few years after a kid, but she changed her mind. Did he communicate this properly? Did they discuss their expectations before engagement? If they had a prior agreement and she went against it, maybe the author is justified. But if she felt misled or if the plans were not concrete, maybe he's being too strict.\n\nAlso, her decision to quit might be based on her family's model, which she saw as positive. However, financial realities differ from the past. The author can't support a family as her father did, so her choice now creates a problem.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is standing up for his needs. He's not forcing her to work, but he can't support them without her income. Breaking the engagement is a serious decision, but if they can't compromise, maybe it's necessary. However, giving an ultimatum might not be healthy for the relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability and having different expectations.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author consider her feelings and reasons for quitting? If she feels that being a full-time homemaker is important to her, and he's not willing to support that financially, maybe there's a mismatch in their values. But he's also realistic about his financial situation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who is inconsiderate of the other's position tends to be at fault. If the author didn't discuss this before she quit, maybe he's responsible. But the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the proposal, not discussing it, which could be the issue. They had a prior plan that she broke, leading to the conflict. The author is reacting to her decision, which affects their future.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial realities and the plan they had, which she changed. Therefore, answer B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
