  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who wants to back out of his engagement because his fianc\u00e9e has decided she won't work after they get married. They both have student loan debt and can't afford to live without her income, especially since they plan to have a child soon.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The man feels that they need her income to survive, and he can't support their family alone. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her father's example, wants to quit her job and stay home, possibly full-time. The man is giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. He's considering backing out of the engagement if she won't work.\n\nThe question is whether the man is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. \n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the couple's situation is precarious. They both have significant debt and can't afford to live without her income. It's reasonable for the man to express concern about their financial stability, especially with plans for a child. If she quits her job, their financial situation would become even more strained. The man isn't just being selfish; he's considering their future and practical realities.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she deserves to stay home, inspired by her mother's experience. However, their financial situation isn't the same as her father's when he could support the family. The man's argument is that they need both incomes to make ends meet. \n\nThe key here is whether the man is justified in not wanting to marry someone who isn't contributing financially. Marriage is a partnership, and both parties should be able to contribute, especially when there are significant financial obligations. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without a financial plan seems impractical given their situation. \n\nAdditionally, the man is considering an ultimatum, which is a serious step. While it's harsh, it's a reflection of his priorities. He's not just making a sudden decision but has a valid reason based on their financial needs. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart also seems abrupt, given they had prior discussions about her returning to work part-time later. \n\nThe father's support for the man's decision if he backs out suggests that the man isn't alone in thinking this is a viable option. The man's stance is about financial responsibility and the feasibility of their future together. Breaking off the engagement over this isn't necessarily wrong if the core issue is irreconcilable differences in financial planning and life goals.\n\nSo, the man isn't in the wrong because he's acting in the interest of their financial stability and future. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is impractical given their financial situation, and he's making a responsible choice to not proceed with the marriage under those circumstances.\n"
