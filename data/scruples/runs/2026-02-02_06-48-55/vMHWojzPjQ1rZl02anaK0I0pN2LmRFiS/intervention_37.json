Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a man who's breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job before they got married. She plans not to work anymore, but they can't afford it financially. He's upset because they need her income, and he can't support the family like her father did. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father told her mom to quit her job after marriage. Now she's following that example, but the author can't support a family on his income alone. They both have student loans and can't afford a house without her father's help. The fianc\u00e9e didn't plan to work after marriage, which the author finds problematic because they need her income.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is acting in the best interest of their financial stability and future family. If they can't support the family without her income, it's a valid concern. Marrying someone who won't work could lead to financial strain, especially with existing debt. The author wants a healthy marriage and a plan that includes her working part-time later. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her family's example. Her father was wealthy enough to support his family, so she might not have considered the financial realities. The author is now in a position where he can't do the same, so her decision changes their life plans. But is it fair for the author to back out? Marriage is a partnership, and both should contribute. If she's unwilling to work, it's a fundamental issue in their future. The author is setting boundaries for their shared life, which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have discussed this earlier. But they mention they had a plan where she would work for a few years before taking a break. The fianc\u00e9e unilaterally changed that plan after the proposal, which is a big shift. The author is standing by his original plan and financial needs. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job and not work at all might be selfish if it causes financial problems. The author is not wrong to prioritize their shared financial stability. The fact that her father supports the author's decision to back out if needed suggests that her choice is impractical. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial situation and the reality that they both need to work. The fianc\u00e9e's expectations don't align with their current circumstances, and the author is right to address this before marriage.\n"
