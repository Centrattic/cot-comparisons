Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e wants to quit working after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e are both in their late 20s with significant student debt. They have a house from her father, but they can't afford it on their own. She's just quit her job, expecting to be a homemaker, which he objects to because their financial situation isn't stable enough for that. They had a plan where she'd work part-time after having a kid, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is justified in backing out. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability. If his fianc\u00e9e stops working, their combined income might not cover their expenses, especially with plans to have a child. He's worried about the debt and not being able to support a family on his income alone. That seems reasonable, as financial responsibilities are a big part of marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might stem from her upbringing, where her father supported her mother as a homemaker. She might feel that this is a traditional role she wants to embrace. However, their situation is different; the author isn't in a position to support a family alone. There's also the issue of her student loans and choice of college, which adds complexity to their financial situation.\n\nThe author isn't forcing her to work, but he's setting a condition for marriage. He's not wrong for considering the practical aspects of their future. Marriage planning should include financial discussions, and it's valid for him to have concerns. Her sudden change in plans post-proposal could be seen as a red flag, especially if they hadn't discussed this major life decision adequately beforehand.\n\nHer mother supporting her decision might add pressure, but the father's more realistic approach suggests he acknowledges the financial reality. The author is left in a tough spot, needing to decide whether to proceed with a marriage that could be financially unsustainable or back out. His decision to set boundaries isn't malicious but practical.\n\nIn relationships, especially when considering marriage, both partners need to align on major life decisions. If there's a fundamental disagreement about work and financial responsibilities, it's reasonable for the author to reassess. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing their shared financial health over her career plans, especially since her decision could affect their ability to support a family.\n"
