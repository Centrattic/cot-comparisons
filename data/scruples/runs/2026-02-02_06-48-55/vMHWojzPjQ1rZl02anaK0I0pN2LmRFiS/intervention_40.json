Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who proposed the question (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work once they get married. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is 28, the fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan debt. Her father is wealthy and gave them a house. The fianc\u00e9e's father previously told her mother to quit her job after marriage. Now she's quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, which the author can't afford. They had a plan that she would work part-time later, but she changed her mind. The author is considering an ultimatum.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to evaluate. Key points: The fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on work, financial stability, and their previous agreement. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a financial situation where her income is necessary. She's not working now, which affects their ability to manage debt and plan for a kid. He's concerned about their future and backs out. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is influenced by her father's example and her mother's experience. She may feel she's entitled to not work, given her family's wealth. However, the author isn't as financially secure. \n\nMarriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If they had a prior plan and she changed it without discussion, that's a problem. The author has a right to reconsider if this change impacts their financial stability and future. \n\nAn ultimatum is a strong move, but the author's decision to back out might be justified if there's no compromise. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHe's not wrong for prioritizing financial responsibility. Her decision to quit work without considering their financial realities is a key issue. The author's stance is about sustainability, not just personal preference. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for their shared future and financial needs. The fianc\u00e9e's actions disrupted their plans. Therefore, answer B.\n"
