Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who proposed the question (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she won't work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 28, fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan and credit card debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father provided them a house, which is the only reason they have one. The author proposed two months ago, but now the fianc\u00e9e resigned from her job without discussing it, planning to stop working entirely after marriage. The author is upset because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid soon. They had previously discussed a plan where she would stop working for a few years when their child starts school, but she wants to quit completely now. The author is considering giving her an ultimatum to work or break up the engagement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break down the factors. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's concerned about their financial stability. They both have debt, and her income is necessary. He's not in a position to support a family alone like her father could. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without prior discussion disrupted their plans. He's considering breaking up to avoid being in a situation where he can't support them both, which he sees as unfair. His father-in-law supports his decision to back out if needed.\n\nFrom the fianc\u00e9e's perspective: She might feel that after getting married, she should be able to focus on being a wife and future mother, especially since her father supported her family in a similar way. Her mother's example (her father told her mom to quit her job) might have influenced her. She might see her decision as a personal choice for the family dynamic, even if it's financially risky.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Communication breakdown\u2014she didn't discuss quitting with him first.\n2. Financial responsibility and sustainability.\n3. Past decisions (her choosing a less expensive school for a relationship, leading to debt).\n4. The ultimatum as a resolution\u2014whether it's fair for the author to demand she work, or if she has the right to choose not to.\n\nMarriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If they had a prior plan that she's now disregarding without communication, that's a problem. Her choice to quit without discussing it shows a lack of consideration for their shared financial situation. The author's stance is about financial necessity and not wanting to be in a situation where he can't support both of them, which is understandable. However, giving an ultimatum might be seen as putting pressure on her to conform to his financial needs rather than respecting her choice. \n\nBut marriage also requires practical considerations. If her decision puts them in an unsustainable financial position, it's reasonable for the author to be concerned. The fianc\u00e9e might not have considered the financial implications fully, especially with their debts and future child. The father-in-law's support for the author's decision suggests that even her family sees the author's position as valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is now considering breaking off the engagement over this, which is a big decision. He might be in the right if the financial realities make marriage unfeasible, but he's also making a choice based on her not meeting his financial expectations. However, if she's unwilling to compromise (like part-time work as they had planned), maybe the author is justified in not proceeding. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I think the author has valid concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's actions disrupted their plans without discussion, leading to a conflict that can't be easily resolved. The author's decision to back out might be a responsible choice given their financial situation, even if it's harsh. So, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
