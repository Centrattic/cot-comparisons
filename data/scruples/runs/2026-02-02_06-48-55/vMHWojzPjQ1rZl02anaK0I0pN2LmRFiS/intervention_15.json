Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong for breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and said she won't work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is 28 and 26, with significant student loan and credit card debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father is very wealthy and gave her a house, but he also told her mom to quit her job when they married. The author proposed, and then she resigned, saying she wants to be a stay-at-home wife. They had a big fight because they need her income to survive, especially if they plan to have a kid soon.\n\nThe author is questioning if it's fair to expect her to work, given her background. Her mom's example was that her dad supported her financially, but now the author can't do that. The fianc\u00e9e went to a state college instead of a more prestigious one because of a past boyfriend, leading to more debt. The author is upset that she didn't plan to use her degree in marriage, adding to their financial burden.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's stance is about financial responsibility. They have debts and can't support a family on his income alone. Her decision to quit her job seems sudden and without considering their current situation. The fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is influenced by her parents' example, but that might not be feasible here.\n\nMarriage is a partnership, so both should contribute. The author is setting a boundary about financial stability, which is understandable. However, giving an ultimatum could be seen as abrupt. The key is whether the author's decision is justified. He's not in the same position as her father, so expecting him to support her fully without her working is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this before proposing. But the fianc\u00e9e's decision came after the proposal, which complicates things. The author is trying to protect their future, so if he can't support her and their potential child, breaking the engagement to avoid a financially unstable marriage might be reasonable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. Her decision to stop working without a clear plan harms their financial stability. He has a right to reevaluate if the engagement can't meet his financial realities. The answer should be B.\n"
