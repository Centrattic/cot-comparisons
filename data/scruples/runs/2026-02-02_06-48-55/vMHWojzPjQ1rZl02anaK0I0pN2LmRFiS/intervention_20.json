Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an engagement where the fianc\u00e9e has quit her job and decided not to work after marriage, which the author finds problematic due to financial reasons. They need her income to support their lifestyle and future child. The author is considering breaking off the engagement over this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father supported her mother financially, expecting her mother to stay home. Now, she's doing the same, which the author can't afford. The author feels the engagement was based on the assumption that she would work part-time later, but she's decided otherwise upon engagement. The author is conflicted about whether to call off the marriage or not.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking a different perspective. I need to evaluate both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to leave her job might be seen as a personal choice, especially if she's financially supported by her family. However, the author's concern about financial stability and future planning is valid. They might not have considered the financial implications of her quitting her job. \n\nIs the author wrong for backing out? Well, if they had prior discussions about future plans and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior communication, that could be a problem. The author is prioritizing financial responsibility, which is understandable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's choice to step back from her career may be a valid personal decision, though it's causing conflict here.\n\nThe father's intervention is interesting; he's advising the author to back out if necessary, which suggests he sees the author's financial limitations. The author's frustration with the fianc\u00e9e's unpaid debt and her past decisions (like attending a different college) might be contributing to his perspective. However, the author is also considering the future child's needs, which adds complexity.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a tough call. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability, especially since they had discussed future plans. The fianc\u00e9e, however, made a unilateral decision that disrupts those plans. The author backing out could be seen as necessary for their financial survival, but it's also a significant decision affecting both people's lives.\n\nThe user's opinion leans towards the author being in the wrong, but I need to consider if the fianc\u00e9e's actions are equally at fault. The author is not making an ultimatum out of spite but out of necessity. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because they're acting in their own and their future family's best interest. However, the situation is nuanced, and both parties have valid points. The key is whether the author's decision is based on reasonable concerns rather than being controlling or dismissive of the fianc\u00e9e's choices.\n"
