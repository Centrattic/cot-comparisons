Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she didn't want to work anymore after getting engaged. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author proposed, and the fianc\u00e9e then quit her job, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. The author is upset because their financial situation isn't stable\u2014both have student loans, they need her income, and they plan to have a kid soon. The fianc\u00e9e's family is wealthy, and her father had a similar setup where her mom didn't work, but he also believes in making their own way. The fianc\u00e9e went to a local college instead of a more prestigious one, leading to higher student debt.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility, expectations about work post-marriage, and the ultimatum the author is considering. The author feels it's unfair to rely on his income alone, especially with the debts. The fianc\u00e9e's family expects her to stay home, which is a big cultural or family norm. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling off the engagement. The author isn't forcing her to work, but he can't support the family alone. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind about the plan they had discussed. The father supports the author backing out if he's not financially ready, so maybe he sees the author's side.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's being realistic about their financial situation. Marrying someone who won't work could lead to financial strain, which is a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which might have broken trust. Also, the author isn't against the idea of her staying home after a kid, but she's decided against working entirely now. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel it's her right to choose not to work, especially influenced by her family's example. However, the author isn't in a position to support a family without her income, which is a valid reason to reconsider the marriage. The ultimatum is tough, but it's about financial survival, which is a major factor in marriage. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
