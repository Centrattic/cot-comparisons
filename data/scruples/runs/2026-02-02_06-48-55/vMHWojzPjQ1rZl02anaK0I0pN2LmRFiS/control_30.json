Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The key points are: the couple has significant student loan debt, they own a house from her father, her father's example of making her mother quit her job, her recent decision to leave her job without discussing it, and their financial situation depending on her income.\n\nThe author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e said she's quitting her job because she wants to be a housewife. He's upset because they need her income, especially with plans to have a kid. They had previously discussed a plan where she'd work part-time after pre-k, but now she's changed her mind. Her mom supports her, but her dad is more level-headed and even suggested the author back out if needed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for considering an ultimatum. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider factors like communication, financial responsibility, and mutual expectations in a marriage. Did they have prior discussions about work and family? The author mentions they had plans, but she changed her mind without discussing. That might be a problem. Also, she took on student debt with a degree she doesn't plan to use, which could affect the financial situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is now making a decision based on her sudden change, which might be a valid response to their mutual financial needs. However, breaking an engagement is a big step. Is it fair to expect her to work if they had prior plans, or is it his responsibility to support her choice if she wants to be a stay-at-home mom, even if it's financially challenging?\n\nI think the key points here are the lack of prior communication about her decision to quit, the financial dependency, and the ultimatum. The author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure their financial stability, but maybe he's at fault if he didn't discuss this earlier. However, given her decision came after the proposal and without prior discussion, he's not in the wrong for reevaluating the commitment. So the answer is B.\n"
