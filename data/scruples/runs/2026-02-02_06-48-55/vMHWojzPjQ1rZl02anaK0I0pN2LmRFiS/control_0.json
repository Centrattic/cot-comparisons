Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because their fianc\u00e9e quit her job and won't work after marriage. The author's fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father was a successful businessman. He told her mother to quit her job when they got married. The couple has been dating for 3.5 years, both have significant student loan debt, and the fianc\u00e9e's father provided them a house. Now, after the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e has resigned from her job, leading to the author's conflict because they need her income to support their future, especially with plans to have a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They feel that the sudden decision to quit her job disrupts their financial planning. They had a plan where she would work part-time after the child starts pre-K. The author isn't in a position to support a family solely on their income and has concerns about student loans. They are considering an ultimatum to work or break up the engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision might stem from her upbringing, seeing her mother as a homemaker supported by her father. Her choice to quit could be based on financial support from her family, which allowed them to have a house. She might believe her financial situation is secure due to her father's wealth, even though the author isn't as financially stable. The father's advice to back out if the author can't support the marriage suggests that he sees the author's position as valid.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual expectations. The author had a plan that included her working, but the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after engagement. This lack of communication or agreement on their future roles could be a problem. The author is concerned about their financial sustainability without her income, which is a valid concern given their debts.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to leave her job might be based on her personal goals and family influence. It's possible she didn't consider the author's financial limitations when making her choice. The author's ultimatum is a reaction to a significant change in circumstances post-engagement, which might not be fair if the engagement was based on the assumption that she would work.\n\nBut the author is also responsible for clearly communicating their expectations earlier in the relationship. If they had discussed the financial plan for after marriage more thoroughly before the engagement, maybe this conflict could have been avoided. The fact that they had a plan (working part-time after the child starts school) and she changed her mind now could indicate a lack of commitment to the mutual agreement.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties have valid points. The author is in a precarious financial situation and needs her income. The fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to leave her job based on her family's example. However, the author's decision to back out could be seen as necessary to avoid financial instability. Alternatively, it might be seen as not respecting her choice, especially if she's willing to rely on her family's support.\n\nThe father's support for the author backing out adds another layer, implying that the author's financial capacity is a legitimate concern. The author's stance is that they can't support a family without her income, which is a realistic concern. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without considering the financial implications could be seen as irresponsible, but it's also a personal choice influenced by her upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are prioritizing financial stability and communicated their expectations before the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in plans post-engagement disrupted their established financial plan. The author's decision to back out is a responsible choice given their financial situation.\n"
