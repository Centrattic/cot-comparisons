Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's engaged to someone who just quit her job because she wants to be a housewife once they get married. They both have student loans and aren't financially stable. The author is upset because they need her income to survive and have plans for a kid. He's considering backing out of the engagement if she won't work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they can't afford to live on his income alone, especially with their debts and future plans. He feels betrayed because they had a plan where she would return to work after having a child, but she decided to quit right before the engagement. He's standing his ground, which makes sense because they need financial stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's side is that her father, who is wealthy, told her mother to quit her job when they got married. She might be following that example. She might feel that since they have a house from her dad, and maybe expects similar support. However, the author isn't in the same financial position as her father, so her decision could be unrealistic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The key points are financial responsibility and communication. They had a prior agreement about her returning to work after a child, but she changed her mind. The author is standing by his original plan, which is about being realistic with their financial situation. \n\nIf the fianc\u00e9e didn't discuss this major life decision with him before quitting, that's a problem. Trust and communication are essential in a relationship, especially when planning marriage. The author is protecting both of their interests by not wanting to be in a marriage where he can't support them both. \n\nHer family's wealth complicates things because she might not have considered the financial realities. The father's advice to the author suggests he understands this. The author isn't pressuring her to work; he's stating his inability to support them without her income. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable. He's making a decision based on their financial needs and the plans they had. Ending the engagement over this is a hard choice, but it's about practicality. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; he's prioritizing their future stability. The answer should be B.\n"
