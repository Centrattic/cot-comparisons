Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e wants to quit her job after they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man proposed two months ago, excited about the future. The fianc\u00e9e then quits her job, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. They both have significant student loan and credit card debt. The house they live in was given by her father. They had a financial plan where she would work part-time after having a kid, but she now wants to quit entirely. Her mom supports this, while her dad is more understanding.\n\nThe core issue is financial dependency. The man can't support them both on his income alone, especially with existing debts. Her decision to quit her job makes their financial situation unsustainable. They had discussed a plan, but she changed her mind after the proposal. The man is considering giving an ultimatum.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Is he justified in backing out? Financial stability is a valid concern. If they can't afford to live on one income, especially with plans for a child, her quitting would make things worse. He's not in a position like her father was, so expecting him to support her full-time without work isn't feasible. \n\nHer decision to quit without discussing it with him first is a problem. They had a previous agreement, and changing it now could be seen as a betrayal. The man is standing by his financial realities. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should have discussed this more before proposing? But the fianc\u00e9e made the decision unilaterally. The father's support for the man backing out suggests that the man isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the man isn't in the wrong for backing out. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial situation. Her sudden change in plans complicates their future, and he's right to prioritize their stability. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
