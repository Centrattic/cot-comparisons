Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she wouldn't work anymore after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family. Her father told her mother to quit her job when they got married, so she expects the same. The couple has a lot of student loan debt and their house was given by her father. The fianc\u00e9e quits her job after the engagement, saying she wants to be a homemaker, but the author can't support the family on his income alone. They had a plan for her to take a break when they have a kid and then return to work part-time and then full-time. But now she's changing her mind, and the author is considering an ultimatum.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to leave her job might not be financially feasible. The author is concerned about their financial stability and future plans. But the fianc\u00e9e's choice to stay home could be based on her upbringing. The father supported their house and bailouts, but the author isn't in the same financial position. \n\nMarriage requires mutual understanding and compromise. The author feels that the engagement was based on a different financial plan, and now the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The fianc\u00e9e might not have considered the financial realities. However, the author is also being realistic about their combined debt and income. \n\nIs it wrong to back out if the financial situation is unsustainable? The author isn't forcing her to work, but the engagement was supposed to be based on mutual plans. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change might have broken trust. On the other hand, the author is being responsible by addressing the issue before marriage. \n\nI think the key here is whether the fianc\u00e9e was upfront about her intentions to leave work. If the author was under the impression that she would work part-time later, and she changed her mind without considering the financial impact, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a rational decision based on their circumstances. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
