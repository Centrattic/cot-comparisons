  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who proposed the engagement is in the wrong for backing out because his fianc\u00e9e decided she wants to quit her job after they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (he) proposed, and they had a plan where she would work for a few years, maybe part-time after their kid starts school. But she decided to quit her job now, which would leave them without her income. They have significant debts and can't afford to live on his income alone. He's saying he can't support a family financially like her father did, so he's considering breaking off the engagement unless she agrees to work.\n\nShe, on the other hand, grew up seeing her father provide for her mother without her working. Her family is wealthy, so maybe she's used to that lifestyle. She might feel that marriage should allow her to not work, which could be a cultural or family expectation. However, their financial situation isn't the same as her father's. They have student loans and other debts, making it impossible to live on one income.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and differing expectations about marriage. The author is concerned about their ability to support a family without her income, especially planning for a child. She's changing the plan they had, and he's not in a position to support her financially like her father did. He's not forcing her to quit when they're together but is standing by their original plan, which she's now rejecting without considering their current financial reality.\n\nIs he wrong for backing out? Well, he's making a decision based on financial stability. If she's not willing to work, and they can't afford to live on his income alone, continuing the engagement might lead to financial strain. Her decision to quit now disrupts their previous agreement, which he's not comfortable with. He's not being unfair by holding her to the plan they had discussed. It's reasonable to expect that both partners contribute to the household, especially when there are financial constraints. Her choice to leave her job without a clear financial plan could be seen as irresponsible, given their situation. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability and backing out if she's not willing to adhere to their original plan.\n"
