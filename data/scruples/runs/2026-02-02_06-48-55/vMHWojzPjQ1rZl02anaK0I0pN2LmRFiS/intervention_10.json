  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an engagement where the fianc\u00e9e decides to quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, which the author finds problematic due to financial reasons. The author is considering an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family, her father provided a house and financial help. The author has student debt and isn't in a position to support a family alone. They had discussed a plan where she'd work until their child starts pre-K. Now she's quitting immediately after engagement, which the author finds unexpected and unaffordable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel entitled to not work after marriage, influenced by her father's past. On the other, the author is concerned about financial stability and their previous agreement. The author's hesitation is about practicality and shared responsibility. \n\nMarriage is a partnership where both contribute. If one partner is unwilling to work when needed, it's a valid concern. The author isn't forcing her to quit but is worried about their financial future. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering the agreement, which the author finds unfair. The father's support in backing out if necessary shows he understands the financial reality.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong to prioritize financial stability and the original plan. The author isn't being selfish; he's addressing a real issue that affects their ability to have a child and manage debt. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on her upbringing, but it's a conflict in life goals. The author's stance is about responsibility and shared commitments, which is reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
