Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The story is about a couple planning to get married, but the fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job, leading to the author considering breaking off the engagement. \n\nFirst, the author is 28, the fianc\u00e9e 26, and they've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan debt. Her father gave them a house, which is a big help, but they still need her income to survive. The author proposed, and then she resigned, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. That caused a major fight because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's father had a similar situation with her mother, who quit her job when he proposed. The author is concerned about financial stability and her student loans. She went to a local state college because of her ex-boyfriend, which led to debt, and her father didn't help with that, but he's given them financial support now.\n\nThe author is conflicted: they don't want to marry if she won't work, but also don't want to make an ultimatum seem negative. The dad is supportive if the author backs out, so maybe he sees the issue too.\n\nNow, who's in the wrong? The fianc\u00e9e made a decision without discussing it, which led to financial instability. The author is being realistic about their current situation. Marrying someone who doesn't plan to contribute financially could be a problem, especially with debt and future plans like having a child. But is it the author's fault for setting an ultimatum?\n\nI think the fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit her job right after the proposal is the main issue. They had a prior plan where she would work until the kid started school. She changed her mind without considering their financial needs. The author is reacting to a practical problem. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is using this as an excuse to end the engagement, that might be harsh. However, given the circumstances, the author is standing up for their financial realities. \n\nAlternatively, could the author have communicated their needs before proposing? The fianc\u00e9e might not have realized the importance of her job. But the author did have prior discussions, so the ultimatum is about her sudden decision. \n\nConsidering all this, the author seems to be in the right because they're addressing a serious financial issue that wasn't resolved. The fianc\u00e9e's action is impractical given their current situation. So the answer is B.\n"
