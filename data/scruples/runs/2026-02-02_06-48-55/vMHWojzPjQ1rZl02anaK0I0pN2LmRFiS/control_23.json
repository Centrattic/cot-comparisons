Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't want to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student loan debt and couldn't afford a house without her father's help. Her father is wealthy and made her mother quit her job when they got married. Now, after the engagement, she quits her job because she wants to be a housewife. The author is upset because they need her income to support their future, including having a child. He had a plan where she would work part-time after the child starts school, but she wants to stop working entirely now.\n\nThe author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or call off the marriage. The question is whether he's at fault for doing that.\n\nI need to think about both sides. On one hand, the author's financial situation is precarious. He's not in a position to support a family alone, especially with debts. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job could jeopardize their plans. On the other hand, she might feel she's following in her mother's footsteps, and the author is pressuring her to work when she doesn't want to. \n\nMarriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If they had discussed and agreed on a plan where she would work part-time later, but she changed her mind without prior discussion, that's a problem. The author is standing by the original plan, which makes sense. However, giving an ultimatum could be seen as controlling or not considering her desire to stay home, but the author's justification is financial necessity.\n\nThe father's support is mentioned, but the mother is fully behind the decision to quit. The financial reality is a key factor here. The author isn't wealthy enough to support a family alone, so he's in a tough spot. If she's not willing to contribute financially, it's a valid concern. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author's ultimatum is reasonable. Since they had prior discussions about her working part-time after the child starts school, her sudden decision to quit without considering the financial impact could be the main issue. The author's stance is about financial survival, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out if he feels the financial situation is unsustainable. His decision is based on practical considerations, not just personal preference. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit might not have been communicated properly, and the author is asserting his need for financial stability in the marriage.\n"
