Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job, which he sees as her not planning to work after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author is concerned about their financial situation. They have student loans, credit card debt, and can't afford a house without help. He proposed, and now she's quitting her job, which he thinks is necessary for their future, especially if they have a kid. He wants her to work, but she doesn't, which causes a big fight. He's considering an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's background: her dad was wealthy, her mom quit her job when they got married. She went to a local college with her boyfriend at the time, which led to more debt. Now she's quitting because she wants to follow what her mom did, not work, and her dad seems to support the author if he backs out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is worried about their financial stability, especially with plans for a child. He's not in a position to support her without her income. Her decision to quit seems abrupt and without considering their financial realities. He had a plan where she'd work part-time later, but she's changing that now that he proposed. That seems like a major life decision that impacts their shared future.\n\nBut also, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective: she might feel that once married, she shouldn't have to work, inspired by her mother's example. However, their financial situation is different from her dad's. The author isn't wealthy, and their debts make it impossible to support a family on one income. Her decision to quit might be seen as not considering their financial needs, which could be selfish.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position. He's trying to be responsible and planning for the future. If she's not willing to work, their financial problems could get worse, especially with a child. He's not forcing her, but he's concerned enough to consider breaking the engagement. Is this a valid reason? Maybe. But is he in the wrong for prioritizing financial stability over her wishes?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fianc\u00e9e is also in the wrong for making a unilateral decision without discussing it more. They had a plan, and she's changing it now. The author's ultimatum is a response to her decision. But is he being too rigid? Maybe they need to find a compromise, but if her stance is that she won't work, then the author is justified in reconsidering the engagement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. He's acting in the interest of their financial future, which is a legitimate concern. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is impacting their shared life in a significant way without considering the consequences. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
