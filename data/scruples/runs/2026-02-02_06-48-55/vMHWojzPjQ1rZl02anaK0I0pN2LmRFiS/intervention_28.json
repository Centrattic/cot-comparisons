  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal and the fianc\u00e9e quitting her job. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the woman comes from a wealthy family where her father made her quit her job after marriage. Now she's expecting the same, even though the author isn't as financially stable. They both have significant student debt and can't afford a house without her father's help. The author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e quit her job, leading to a conflict because they need her income, especially for future kids. She had a plan before to work until the kid starts school, but now she wants to stay home permanently. Her mom supports this, but her dad is more understanding. The author is considering backing out if she doesn't work.\n\nThe author's main arguments are financial responsibility and the need for her income. He's concerned about their financial stability, especially with student debt and future childcare costs. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit seems sudden, changing their previous agreement. The author is giving her an ultimatum, which is causing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that after marrying, she should be able to step back from work, especially with her family's support. But the author's financial situation doesn't allow for that. The key here is whether the author is wrong to back out. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nTraditional roles might say a spouse can choose to stay home, but when financial reality doesn't allow it, maybe the author is right. However, the author is now putting pressure on her to work, which might not be ideal in a marriage. But considering their financial situation, the author's stance seems practical. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind unexpectedly, which disrupts their plans. I think the author is not in the wrong here because he's standing by his financial reality. The answer should be B.\n"
