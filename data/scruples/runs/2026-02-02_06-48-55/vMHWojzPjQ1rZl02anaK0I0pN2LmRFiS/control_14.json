  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a person breaking off an engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after getting married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (the person asking if they're the AITA) proposed, but the fianc\u00e9e quit her job and wants to be a stay-at-home wife. The author is upset because they can't afford to support her financially, especially with their debts and plans for a child. They had previously discussed a plan where she would work for a few years after having a kid, then part-time later. Now she's changed her mind, and the author is considering breaking up.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the key points. The author's main argument is that they can't financially support a spouse who isn't working. They have significant student debt and credit card debt, and their future plans relied on her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit seems to come out of the blue, and she's not willing to compromise on the work plan they had discussed. Her family's background is wealthy, but they also support making your own way. The father even gave them a house and bailouts. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side is that she wants to follow a traditional role of being a wife, similar to her mother. She didn't consider the financial implications, perhaps due to her upbringing where her father could support her mother. However, she went to a less expensive college, taking on student loans, which the author is now questioning. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual expectations in a marriage. The author felt they had a plan, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering their financial reality. The author is not willing to be in a marriage where he can't support his spouse and future child, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on personal desires or her family's example, but if it's not feasible given their circumstances, it's a problem. \n\nAlso, the father's advice to the author to back out if he's not in a financial position to support a spouse seems reasonable. The author is standing by his financial reality, which is important in a marriage. The fianc\u00e9e might not have considered the financial aspect, but that doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing their financial stability. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a decision based on their current financial situation and the need for mutual compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit her job disrupts their plans, and the author is justified in reevaluating the engagement.\n"
