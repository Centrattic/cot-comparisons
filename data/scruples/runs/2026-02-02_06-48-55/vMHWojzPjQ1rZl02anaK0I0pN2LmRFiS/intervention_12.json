Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both perspectives. The author is 28, fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating 3.5 years. Both have significant student debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father gave them a house, but they still struggle with other debts. The author proposed, and then the fianc\u00e9e quit her job to become a homemaker immediately. The author is upset because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid in a year. He wants a plan where she works part-time after the kid starts pre-K. But she's decided she won't work again, which the author sees as a deal-breaker.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e's side: Her father's example (he had her mother quit her job when they married) might have influenced her. She went to a local state school because of her boyfriend at the time, leading to more debt. The author is frustrated that she didn't use her degree and now wants to quit working, which complicates their financial situation.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or break up. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to pressure her with an ultimatum but feels it's necessary. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, the key points are financial responsibility and differing expectations. The author has valid concerns about their ability to support a family with his income alone, especially with existing debts. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job without prior discussion might have broken their previous agreement. However, her background (father's influence, her mother's example) could explain her desire to be a homemaker.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to proceed if she isn't going to work? If their financial situation can't support her staying home, then he's justified in being concerned. Marriage requires agreement on major life decisions, like career paths. If they had a prior understanding that she would work part-time later, and she's now changing that, it's reasonable for him to reevaluate. The father's support for backing out if necessary also suggests that the father sees this as a valid decision.\n\nHowever, the author is also being strict about something that might not be entirely within his control. Maybe the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons for wanting to stay home, and their financial situation could improve over time. But given the debts and the need for her income, her decision seems impractical.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, fairness and communication are key. The author didn't mention prior discussions about her quitting. If they hadn't talked about this, then she might be wrong to quit without discussion. But the author is now choosing to break off the engagement over it. It's a tough call. The author's stance is about financial responsibility and their shared future. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her upbringing and personal aspirations. Neither side is entirely right or wrong, but the author's decision to back out is about protecting their shared future. Since they had a plan and she changed it unilaterally, the author isn't in the wrong for reevaluating.\n"
