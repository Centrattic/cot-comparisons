  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job instead of working after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is 28, she's 26, they've been dating for 3.5 years. They have student debt and couldn't afford a house without her dad's help. He proposed two months ago, but she quit her job, saying she wants to be a wife and not work. They had a fight because they need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. The author is struggling financially and can't support a family on his own. She went to a local state college instead of a more reputable school, leading to student debt. They had a previous plan where she would work until the kid starts pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe author is conflicted: he doesn't want to marry someone who won't work, but he also doesn't want to make an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports her decision, but the dad is more level-headed and says it's okay if the author backs out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's choosing to break off the engagement because of financial realities. He's not okay with the idea of being the sole provider, especially with their debts and future plans. On the other hand, she's making a choice based on what she wants for her life, influenced by her mother's example. \n\nThe key points here are about autonomy and mutual expectations. She changed her mind about work after they got engaged, which might have been a major life decision that wasn't discussed enough. The author is standing his ground because he can't support the family on his own. It's a matter of whether he's being unreasonable or just making a decision based on their financial situation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible choice based on their financial needs. She changed her stance on work without considering their combined financial situation. The author is prioritizing practicality over emotional attachment. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
