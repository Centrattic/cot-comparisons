Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work after marriage. The author's main points are about financial responsibility, debt, and the need for both incomes to support a future family. The fianc\u00e9e's side is influenced by her father's example, where he expected her mother to quit her job after they married.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is 28, in a 3.5-year relationship, both have significant student debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy and supported his wife financially, but the author isn't in a similar position. The fianc\u00e9e's plan to quit her job now seems to clash with their financial reality. The author feels that they need both incomes to manage their debts and future child-related expenses. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has different expectations based on her upbringing.\n\nThe key issue here is the sudden change in plans. The author had a discussion about the fianc\u00e9e working part-time after having a kid, but she decided to quit immediately upon engagement. This is a significant shift that affects their financial stability. The author is concerned about not being able to support a family alone, which is a valid concern given their current debts. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasoning might stem from her mother's experience, but her father's approach might not be applicable to their situation. The author isn't in a position where he can support a family without her income, so expecting him to do so could be unrealistic. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to take out loans for a school she wasn't committed to (because she wanted to be close to her boyfriend) might also be a point of contention, though the author acknowledges that past choices shouldn't be blamed now.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum, which is a serious step. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's standing up for their financial reality and his inability to support a family alone. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e believes she has the right to choose not to work after marriage, influenced by her family's example.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's decision to back out is based on practical considerations, while the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her upbringing and personal desire. However, the author is not at fault for prioritizing their financial stability. He's not forcing her to quit; he's pointing out the financial implications. The fianc\u00e9e changing her plans without considering the impact on their shared future could be seen as the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out because the financial reality doesn't support her new plan, and he's making a reasonable decision based on their circumstances.\n"
