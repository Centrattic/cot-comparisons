  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who's breaking off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore, which he feels is necessary because they can't afford it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy proposed, and then she told him she's quitting her job. He's upset because they both have student debt, and they need her income to support a future family. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is influenced by her father's example, where he told her mom to quit her job when he proposed. Now she's following that model, but the guy isn't in a financial position to support her not working.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's break it down. The author is the guy who's backing out because she won't work. Is he wrong for doing that? Well, he's making a practical decision based on financial realities. He's not asking her to work if they don't need her income, but right now, they do. If she doesn't work, their financial situation could be unsustainable, especially with plans for a kid. \n\nOn the other hand, she might feel that she's justified because her family did it, and she's choosing to follow that path. However, her decision is causing a major conflict in their relationship. The guy feels that the plan they had (working part-time after the kid starts school) is being thrown out without discussion. She also went to a state school for personal reasons, which might factor into her perspective on financial independence. \n\nBut here's the thing: marriage involves making compromises. If she never planned to work, maybe she didn't consider the financial implications, and the guy has a right to be concerned about their future. The guy's stance is about responsibility and practicality. He's not forcing her to work, but he can't support the marriage without her income. \n\nThe father's reaction is understanding, which adds weight to the guy's position. The mother is supporting her daughter's decision, which might be part of the problem. But the guy's argument is that their financial situation isn't stable enough for her to stop working. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? If he backs out, he's prioritizing financial stability, which is a valid concern. He's not being unreasonable by pointing out that they need both incomes. She might have changed her stance without discussing it, which is a problem. The guy's ultimatum is a response to a situation that affects their entire future. \n\nI think the key factors are communication and expectations. If she didn't discuss this with him beforehand, that's an issue. But the guy also has the right to set boundaries based on their financial realities. He's not wrong for not wanting to take on financial strain. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
