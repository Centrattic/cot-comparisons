Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who proposed the situation is in the wrong. So, the author of the situation is a guy who's planning to break off his engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. The main question is whether he's at fault for backing out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman comes from a wealthy family where her father made her mother quit her job after marriage. Now she's following a similar path, which the author is uncomfortable with because they can't afford to live on his income alone. They have significant debt and need her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. \n\nThe author mentions they had a plan for her to work part-time until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind. He feels she never intended to use her degree because she went to a local college for her relationship instead of a better school. But he's not blaming her for past decisions, just the current ultimatum.\n\nHe's conflicted about giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. He doesn't want to force her but also can't support a family without her income. The father-in-law is supportive of backing out if needed, but the mother and fianc\u00e9e are against it.\n\nNow, to assess fault. The woman's decision to quit her job is a significant life choice that impacts their financial stability. The author is concerned about their future and the practicalities of supporting a family. Marriages require mutual compromise, and if one partner is making a decision that the other can't support, it's a valid reason to reconsider the commitment. \n\nHowever, the author is also using an ultimatum, which can be a harsh approach. But given the circumstances\u2014financial strain, debt, and the need for her income\u2014it's a reasonable stance. The woman changed their agreed plan without discussion, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's decision is selfish or necessary. Since their financial situation is precarious and her income is vital, the author's choice to back out isn't unreasonable. He's prioritizing financial responsibility over an idealized scenario that her family expects but isn't feasible for them. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on their shared financial realities. Breaking off the engagement under these circumstances is a responsible choice, not a selfish one.\n"
