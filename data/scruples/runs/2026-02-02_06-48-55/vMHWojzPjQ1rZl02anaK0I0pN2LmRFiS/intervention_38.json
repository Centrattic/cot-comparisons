Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple engaged to be married, but the fianc\u00e9e has decided to quit her job and not work after marriage, which the author is against because they can't afford it. The author is considering backing out of the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that they need both incomes to manage their debts and future plans, like having a child. The fianc\u00e9e, influenced by her father's example, wants to be a homemaker. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, expectations in marriage, and communication. The author didn't discuss this major life decision with their fianc\u00e9e before she made it. They had a plan where she would work until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind after the proposal. That could be a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she has the right to choose her lifestyle, especially given her family's background. However, making such a decision unilaterally without considering the financial implications could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nThe author is now considering an ultimatum, which is a tough choice. But if they can't support each other in their plans, maybe it's better to break up. The father's advice to back out if it's not feasible makes sense. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9e made a decision that affects both their financial stability without prior discussion. The author is reacting to a problem that was created by her. However, expecting someone to stay in a relationship where they can't meet basic financial needs is also a valid concern. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on practicality, while the fianc\u00e9e's is based on personal desire. But in a partnership, both need to compromise. If the fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her intentions, that's a problem. The author is right to question the sustainability of the marriage if both can't agree on financial responsibilities. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to back out. The fianc\u00e9e's decision was unilateral and may not consider the author's financial reality. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
