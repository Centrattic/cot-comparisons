Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author proposed two months ago, and the fianc\u00e9e recently quit her job, expecting to be a homemaker. The couple has significant student loan debt and other financial issues. They had planned for her to work until the child started Pre-K, but she changed her mind after the proposal. The author feels they can't support a family on his income alone, especially with her debt. The fianc\u00e9e's father supports the author backing out if he can't handle the financial burden.\n\nThe key points here are the financial realities and differing expectations. The author is concerned about their ability to manage without her income, which is valid given their debt. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit seems to come as a surprise, conflicting with their previous plan. But was it her right to make that decision?\n\nMarriage is a partnership, and both parties should have a mutual understanding of financial responsibilities. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after planning to work for some years might be seen as a shift in commitment. However, choosing to be a homemaker is a personal decision, and if the author can't support that financially, it's a legitimate issue.\n\nThe father's input adds another layer, showing he acknowledges the financial strain. The author's ultimatum is a response to a situation that affects their shared future. While it's harsh, it's a reaction to a potential unsustainable scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel it's her right to choose a traditional role, especially given her father's example. However, the author isn't in the same financial position as her father, so her expectations might be unrealistic. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a rational decision based on their current financial situation and future plans. Backing out is a difficult choice, but it's about practicality rather than being wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without addressing the financial implications could be the root problem here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
