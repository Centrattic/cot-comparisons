Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she won't work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her dad expected her mom to quit her job after marriage. Now she's doing the same, quitting her job because she's about to get married. The author is upset because they need her income to manage their finances, especially with plans to have a kid. They had previous plans for her to work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she wants to stop working entirely. The author is considering breaking off the engagement over this, and the fianc\u00e9e's mom supports her decision while the dad is more neutral, even suggesting it's okay if the author backs out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's the case. So, is it fair for the author to expect his fianc\u00e9e to keep working if she wants to stop? Or is the author being unreasonable by not accepting her choice?\n\nMarriage involves mutual agreement and shared goals. The author had a plan that included her working part-time after the kid, but she's changed her mind. The author is concerned about financial stability. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on her family's example and her personal wishes. \n\nIs it the author's right to make this a deal-breaker? If both had discussed this before the engagement, maybe, but they had previous agreements. Now she's changed her stance abruptly. The author is in a tough spot because they can't support a family on his income alone. But is it his fault? He's trying to be responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to stop working now might be seen as unrealistic if they can't afford it. The author's stance could be seen as practical, given their financial situation. But is it fair to break off the engagement because of this? It's a major life decision. \n\nThe key points are financial dependency, shared responsibility, and communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they can't support her financially and she's not willing to adjust. However, the fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit her job could be seen as self-centered if it puts the marriage at risk financially. \n\nThe author's ultimatum might be harsh, but given the financial realities, it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's family history shows that expecting a spouse to quit work isn't always feasible for everyone. The author isn't wealthy like her father, so he's in a different situation. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering the financial impact, which the author has to address. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
