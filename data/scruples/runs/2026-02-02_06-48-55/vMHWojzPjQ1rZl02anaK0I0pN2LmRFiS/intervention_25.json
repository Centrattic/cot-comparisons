Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't want to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her dad is a successful businessman. Her dad told her mom to quit her job when they married, so she's used to that lifestyle. The fianc\u00e9e has student loans because she went to a state school instead of a \"real\" school her dad would have paid for. They both have significant debt, and their house is from her dad. The guy proposed, but she quits her job, and he's upset because they need her income, especially if they have a kid. The plan was for her to work until the kid starts pre-K, but she wants to quit now.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: work or no marriage. He doesn't want the marriage to be based on an ultimatum, but he's also worried about finances.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's look at both sides. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her father's example is okay, but the husband-to-be can't afford to support a family without her income. He's trying to be realistic about their financial situation. On the other hand, she might feel that marriage should allow her to step back from work, similar to her mother's situation.\n\nBut the key points are financial responsibility and the ultimatum. The author is backing out because he can't afford a spouse not working, which is a valid concern. However, giving an ultimatum could be seen as controlling or not considering her autonomy. But given their financial constraints, his stance might be justified. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit without discussing finances first could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's main issue is financial survival, which is a legitimate reason. He's not forcing her to work indefinitely, just acknowledging their current situation. The fianc\u00e9e's family's wealth might make it easier for her to not work, but they aren't in that position. The author is trying to set realistic expectations. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. He's making a difficult decision based on practicality rather than just emotional attachment. The fianc\u00e9e's expectations might not align with their reality, and he's standing his ground. So the answer is B.\n"
