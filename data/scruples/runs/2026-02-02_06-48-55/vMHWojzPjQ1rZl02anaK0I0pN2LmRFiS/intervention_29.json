Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author, who is 28, proposed to his fianc\u00e9e, who is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. Their financial situation is tough\u2014they have a lot of student loans and their only house was a gift from her father. Now, the fianc\u00e9e has quit her job because she wants to be a homemaker, but the author feels that their financial situation can't support that. They had previously agreed that she might take a break from work when they have a kid, but not immediately after marriage. \n\nThe author is upset because her decision to quit her job upends their plans and financial stability. He's considering whether it's okay to break the engagement because he can't support her without working. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports her decision, but her dad is more level-headed and even tells the author it's okay if he backs out. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The key points are about expectations, communication, and financial responsibility. Did the author have a right to expect she would continue working? They had discussed plans for her to take time off when they have a kid, but she decided to quit now. The author feels this is a betrayal of their previous agreement and financial reality.\n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9e has the right to choose her career path, including choosing to be a homemaker, especially if she's from a family where that's the norm. However, the financial aspect is a big factor here. The author argues that they need her income to survive, especially with debts and future plans like having a child. \n\nBut did they communicate their expectations clearly? The author mentions they had talked about her working part-time after pre-K. If the fianc\u00e9e decided to quit without discussing it, maybe there was a breakdown in communication. However, the author is now considering breaking off the engagement over this, which is a major decision. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting to be in a financially unstable marriage? Or is the fianc\u00e9e in the wrong for changing her mind about work without considering the financial impact? \n\nAnother angle is that the author is putting an ultimatum to work or no marriage, which might be seen as pressuring her into a career choice. But if their financial situation can't support her not working, is it fair to expect her to continue working? \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's background is important\u2014her father told her mother to quit her job when they married. So maybe she grew up seeing that model. But the author's financial situation is different, so there's a mismatch in expectations. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is concerned about their combined debt and the need for her income. If they proceed with marriage and she doesn't work, they might face financial strain. The author is prioritizing financial stability, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might be based on her personal desires and family influence. The author is now questioning the viability of the marriage based on this decision. \n\nBut is it fair to break off the engagement over this? The author feels they can't support a spouse without her help, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e might feel she has the right to choose her lifestyle as a spouse. \n\nI think the author's position is reasonable given their financial situation. Marrying someone who has a significant financial impact on your life is a big deal, and if their partner's decision to not work makes the marriage unsustainable, it's valid to reconsider. However, breaking off the engagement because of differing financial expectations could be seen as a failure to compromise. \n\nBut given that they had discussed future plans and she changed her mind without considering the financial aspects, the author's stance might be justified. The key is whether they had a clear agreement. If they had agreed on her working part-time until pre-K and she decided to quit, that's a breach of their prior understanding. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's decision disrupted their financial plans, and the author is responsible for considering their future. However, the author should have addressed this earlier if it was a deal-breaker. But since it's a recent development, maybe it's reasonable to reconsider the engagement.\n"
