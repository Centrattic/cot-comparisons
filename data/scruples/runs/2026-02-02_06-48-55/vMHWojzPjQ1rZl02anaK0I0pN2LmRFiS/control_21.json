Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author proposing to his fianc\u00e9e, but she then decides she doesn't want to work anymore, even though they can't afford it. He's upset because they need her income, especially with plans for a kid. She had a different plan where she would work part-time later, but now she's quitting immediately. The question is whether he's at fault for backing out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has student debt, they need her job to survive, and there's the future kid to think about. Her background is that her dad made her mom quit her job when they married, so maybe she's emulating that. But the author can't support a family alone like her dad did. She also took student loans for a degree she doesn't plan to use, which complicates things. \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect her to work? Well, financial stability is a big factor. If she quits, they can't afford basic needs. Marrying someone who isn't working could be a burden. On the other hand, maybe she's making a choice about her career and family, which is her right. But if they can't afford it, that's a real problem.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum, which might not be healthy, but his reasoning is about their financial survival. Her family's support is there, but they can't rely on that long-term. Her mother's support for quitting is part of the issue, but her father is more reasonable.\n\nSo, the author is trying to be responsible. He's backed out because her decision changes their financial plan. Is he wrong? It's a tough call. If they had discussed future plans and she went against them, maybe he's justified. But maybe she has valid reasons for wanting to stay home. However, the key point is that their current financial situation depends on her income. If she quits, they can't sustain their lifestyle. So the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their financial stability over the engagement. They both need to be on the same page about finances and future plans. Since she changed her mind without considering the impact, the author is not in the wrong for backing out. Answer B.\n"
