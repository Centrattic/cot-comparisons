Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author, who is 28, is engaged to a woman who is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. Both have significant student loan debt and couldn't afford a house on their own, so her wealthy father gave them a house. The problem arises when the fianc\u00e9e quits her job after the engagement, stating she wants to be a homemaker. The author is upset because they need her income to support their future plans, like having a kid. They had discussed a plan where she would work for a few years until their child started pre-K, then part-time, etc. Now she's changing her mind, and the author is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author's main concern is financial stability. They rely on her income, and her quitting would make it difficult to manage their debts and future family expenses. They might feel that the engagement was supposed to be a partnership, and one person quitting work without mutual agreement disrupts that balance. Also, there's the issue of her student loans and the fact that she could have avoided debt by attending a different school, which might indicate poor financial planning. However, the author also acknowledges that her choice to go to a local state school was influenced by her relationship at the time, which adds context but doesn't necessarily excuse the current situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's side is influenced by her father's example, where her mother quit her job after marriage. She might see this as a traditional or expected role, especially with the support of her mother. Her father is wealthy and allowed her mother to not work, so she might believe it's feasible for her to do the same. However, the author's financial situation is different; he's not as wealthy and can't support a family without her income. The conflict here is between her desire to be a homemaker and his need for her income.\n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) The engagement is a partnership where both parties should have mutual agreement on major life decisions. 2) The fianc\u00e9e made a unilateral decision to quit her job, which directly affects their financial future. 3) The author is now considering breaking off the engagement because he can't support the family on his income alone. 4) The author is not asking her to work out of guilt but because it's necessary for their financial stability.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e decided to quit without discussing and agreeing on a plan, then the author is justified in reevaluating the engagement. Marriage requires both partners to be on the same page about major life choices. However, the author is now giving an ultimatum, which might be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, if the fianc\u00e9e is unwilling to work and the author can't support the family, the author isn't wrong in standing his ground. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit after the engagement could be seen as breaking the implicit agreement of the engagement, which includes mutual support and shared responsibilities. The author's stance is about financial reality, which is a valid concern.\n\nAnother angle is that the fianc\u00e9e might have different expectations based on her upbringing. However, the author's situation is different, and expecting him to support a lifestyle that requires him to be the sole breadwinner when he can't do so is unreasonable. The father's advice to the author to back out if he can't handle it supports the idea that the author isn't in the wrong. The author is prioritizing financial responsibility and honest communication, which are important in a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because he's making a decision based on the financial realities they face, and the fianc\u00e9e made a unilateral decision that affects their shared future without considering the implications. The author has a right to reconsider the engagement if the terms have changed significantly after the proposal.\n"
