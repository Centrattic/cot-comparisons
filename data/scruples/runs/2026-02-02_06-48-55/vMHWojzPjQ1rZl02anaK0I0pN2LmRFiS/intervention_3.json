Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is engaged to a woman who has decided to quit her job and not work after they get married. The author is upset because they need her income to support their lifestyle and future plans, like having a kid. The fianc\u00e9e's father had a similar setup where her mom didn't work, and now she wants the same. The author is considering backing out of the engagement if she doesn't agree to work, and they're asking if they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's argument is that they can't financially support a family on his income alone, especially with their student loans and other debts. They had a prior plan where she would work for a few years before having a kid, but now she's changed her mind and wants to quit immediately. The author feels this is a major change in plans and doesn't want to be stuck in a marriage where they have to support her financially without her contribution. \n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that she's earned the right to not work after marriage, inspired by her mother's situation. Her father's financial support played a big role in them being able to afford a house, so maybe she feels entitled to a similar lifestyle. Her decision to quit could be based on wanting to focus on family or personal reasons, even if it's not financially ideal. However, she might not have considered the author's financial situation or the practicalities of their combined debts.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. The author is making a decision based on financial responsibility. Marriage is a partnership, and both should be on the same page about major life decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without discussing it properly, that's an issue. The author is setting a boundary by saying they can't proceed unless she works, which is about their own limits and needs. \n\nBut is that ultimatum fair? Well, the author isn't forcing her to work; they're saying they can't live up to the financial demands of a non-working spouse. That's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job is a significant change that affects both their lives. If the author can't support her financially, then it's reasonable for him to reconsider the marriage. However, it's also possible that communication issues led to this situation. Maybe they didn't discuss future plans adequately before the engagement.\n\nLooking at the fianc\u00e9e's actions, she made a decision that changes their financial plan without prior agreement. The author had a different plan, and her sudden change might be seen as irresponsible. However, the author's reaction is a firm no, which could be seen as not giving her a chance to adjust her plans. But given the financial realities, the author is protecting their own interests and future stability.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about conflicting values and priorities. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability and shared responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e isn't wrong for choosing a different life path, but it's a compatibility issue. Since they can't agree on a fundamental aspect of their future, the author backing out is a way to avoid a marriage built on financial strain. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
