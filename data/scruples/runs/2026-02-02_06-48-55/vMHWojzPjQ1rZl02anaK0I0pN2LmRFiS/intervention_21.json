Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage. The author is 28, the fianc\u00e9e is 26. They've been dating for 3.5 years. He proposed two months ago, but she resigned to stop working, which caused a conflict. He's arguing that their financial situation can't support her not working, especially since they have student debt and plan to have a kid. She had a different plan where she would work part-time after the kid starts pre-K.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: she works or they don't get married. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job is based on her father's example and her mother's influence. Her father was wealthy and told her mother to quit her job. Now she wants the same, but the author can't support that financially. The author feels they need her income to survive, especially with plans for a child. He's also upset that she didn't use her degree and took loans unnecessarily. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her decision is personal and that she's following her family's model. The author is now questioning her past choices, like attending a local college instead of a more prestigious one, which led to more debt. But the user says the author is in the wrong, which makes me think maybe the author is being too harsh? Or maybe not?\n\nI need to consider if the author is justified in his decision. If the fianc\u00e9e suddenly changed her long-term plan without discussing it, that could be a problem. The author thought they had a mutual understanding that she would work for a few years after the kid starts school. But she changed her mind after the proposal. That could be a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, financial responsibility is a key point. If they can't afford to live without both incomes, then not working could be a significant strain. However, the author's father-in-law is supportive, and the house was given to them. But the author might not want to rely on his father-in-law indefinitely. \n\nThe author is considering breaking off the engagement, which is a big decision. But if he's giving her an ultimatum, is that fair? Or is it a reasonable boundary given their financial reality? If she's unwilling to compromise, maybe the author is justified in not proceeding. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise from both sides. The author is setting a boundary based on financial necessity, which is valid. But if the fianc\u00e9e is now changing her stance, maybe she didn't consider the financial implications, which could be her fault. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the engagement was based on the expectation that she would work, and she changed her mind without prior discussion, then the author's decision to back out might be justified. On the other hand, if they had a plan and she changed it after the proposal, that's a breach of their agreement. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is making her choose between her personal desires and financial stability, maybe he's inconsiderate. But he's also standing his ground on financial reality. \n\nHmm. The key factors are: Did they discuss life plans, including work and finances, before the engagement? If the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind suddenly, that's a problem. If they had agreed on a plan and she's now deviating, the author is right to question it. \n\nAlso, the author is not wealthy like her father, so he can't afford to support a family on his own. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might be unrealistic. The author is protecting himself from financial strain. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a decision based on their financial situation and future plans. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart is causing a conflict that they can't resolve. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
