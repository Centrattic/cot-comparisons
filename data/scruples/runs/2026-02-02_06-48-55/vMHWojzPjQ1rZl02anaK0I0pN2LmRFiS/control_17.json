Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job and doesn't want to work anymore after marriage. \n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed story. The key points: the fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family. Her father had a successful business and told her mom to quit her job after they married. Now the fianc\u00e9e is quitting her job before marriage, which the author sees as a problem because they can't afford to live on his income alone. They both have student loan debt and other debts. The house was given by her dad. The author wants her to work, maybe part-time later, but she now wants to be a full-time homemaker immediately. They had a previous plan to have her work until pre-K, but she changed her mind after engagement.\n\nThe author is conflicted but considering giving her an ultimatum. He's asking if he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in backing out because of her decision to stop working. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have different views on whether a spouse should work. Some believe it's a personal choice, others think it's important for financial stability. The author has legitimate concerns about their financial situation. They need two incomes to survive, especially planning for a kid. If she quits, they might not be able to manage. \n\nBut then, the fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is influenced by her parents' example. Her father was wealthy enough to support her mom. However, the author isn't in a similar financial position. This is a big difference. The author isn't at fault for not being able to support a spouse financially if that's not feasible. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of planning. They had a previous agreement about her working until pre-K, but she changed her mind after engagement. That's a significant change in plans. The author has the right to reassess if the marriage plans are based on mutual agreements that are now being broken. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job without discussing the financial implications thoroughly could be seen as careless, especially considering their debts. The author is responsible for their financial future and is making a choice to protect that. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being rigid. Maybe they could find a compromise, like her working part-time or finding a lower-cost solution for childcare. But the author mentions that daycare is expensive, and their financial situation doesn't allow for that. \n\nThe father-in-law's support for the author's decision suggests that he sees the author's position as reasonable. The mother-in-law is behind the fianc\u00e9e, but the father is more level-headed. This adds credibility to the author's stance. \n\nIn terms of ultimatums, giving one is a tough choice. But given the circumstances, if the marriage requires a financial commitment that the author can't meet unless she works, it's a valid concern. The author isn't forcing her to work for his benefit; it's about their shared financial reality. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial situation and the need for both incomes. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on a major life decision after engagement, which disrupts their plans. The author has the right to reevaluate the commitment if the terms have changed significantly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
