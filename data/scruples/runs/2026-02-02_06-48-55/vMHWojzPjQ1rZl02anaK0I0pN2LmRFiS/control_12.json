Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father was successful and told her mother to quit her job upon marriage. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is doing the same, but the author is in a different financial situation. They both have significant student loans and credit card debts. The house they have is from her father. The author proposed, and then she resigned, leading to a major fight because they need her income to survive, especially if they plan to have a kid. \n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum: she works or they don't get married. They also mention that their plan was to have her work part-time for a few years until the kid starts school, but she changed her mind. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports this decision, while her dad is more understanding and suggests the author shouldn't feel pressured unless they can financially support it.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, the question is whether the author is right to withdraw the proposal. The author is concerned about financial stability and their own ability to support a family, especially with existing debts. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems to be influenced by her family's example, but the author isn't in the same financial position. \n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations in a marriage. The author had a plan that required both incomes, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the proposal. The author is not forcing her to work, but is questioning if it's fair to expect them to support her and a child without her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on her upbringing, but the author's situation is different. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They had a discussion about future plans, and if the fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision to quit her job contradicts those plans and the author can't afford the resulting financial strain, it's reasonable for them to reconsider. However, the way they approach it matters. An ultimatum might not be the healthiest way to resolve this, but the decision to back out is based on real financial concerns. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's actions could be seen as not considering the partner's financial reality. The author's student loans and the need for her income to support a family without relying on her father's help might make this a valid reason. But the author's hesitation about using an ultimatum shows they're trying to think about the relationship's health as well. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a decision based on their own circumstances and the mutual plans they had discussed. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without considering the financial implications, which the author is addressing by reconsidering the engagement.\n"
