Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who wants to back out of his engagement because his fianc\u00e9e has decided to quit her job and not work once they get married. The key points here are the financial situation, her decision to leave her job, and the ultimatum he's considering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple both have significant student loan debt, and they can't afford a house on their own. The woman's father provided the house, which is a big help but not a solution. The author is 28, she's 26, and they've been dating for 3.5 years. The woman's father ran a successful business and made her mother quit her job when they married. Now the fianc\u00e9e is following a similar path by quitting her job after the proposal. \n\nThe author is upset because they need her income to support their future, including having a kid. They had a previous plan where she would work until the child starts pre-K, but she changed her mind. The author is considering an ultimatum, which he knows might not be healthy. The fianc\u00e9e's mom supports her decision, but the dad is more level-headed and even suggested that the author should back out if he can't support the lifestyle.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLooking at this, the author's concern is practical: financial sustainability. The couple's financial situation is precarious without her income. If she quits, they might not be able to manage, especially with plans for a child. The author's reasoning is that marriage should be based on mutual support, and he can't support her decision to stop working if it jeopardizes their stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision might be influenced by her upbringing, where her mother didn't work. She might feel entitled to the same lifestyle, especially coming from a wealthy family. However, the author isn't in the same financial position as her father. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but he's trying to be realistic.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing financial stability over her career plans. Since the decision affects both their lives, the author is trying to set boundaries based on his circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to quit might not have considered the author's financial limitations, making the author's response understandable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out, as he's being honest about his inability to support a financially unsustainable arrangement.\n"
