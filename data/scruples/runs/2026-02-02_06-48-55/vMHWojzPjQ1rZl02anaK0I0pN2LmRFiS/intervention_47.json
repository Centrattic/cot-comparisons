  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed and is now backing out) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after marriage. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together 3.5 years, both have student loans, and she received a house from her dad. Her dad didn't work when he married her mom, which influenced her. She quits her job now, expecting to be a stay-at-home wife, but the author can't support that financially. They had a plan for her to return to work after having a kid, but she's changing her mind.\n\nThe author is conflicted: he wants her to work, but she's not willing, which could impact their financial stability. He's considering an ultimatum but is unsure if that's right. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Financial Responsibility:** The author argues that they need her income. If she quits, their financial situation becomes unsustainable. That's a valid concern. \n\n2. **Her Decision:** She's making a choice based on her parents' example, but it's a major life decision that affects both. The author feels betrayed because they had a plan, and she's changing it unilaterally.\n\n3. **Marriage Expectations:** Marriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If one partner's priorities conflict with the other's, it's a problem. The author might feel that her decision undermines their shared future plans.\n\n4. **Her Background:** Her family's wealth and her dad's influence might have led her to believe she can quit work. However, the author isn't in the same financial position. It's a mismatch in expectations.\n\n5. **Emotional Aspects:** The author is in a tough spot. He proposed, expecting her to continue working, but she's changed her mind. He's trying to balance his values (not supporting a financially unstable marriage) with not wanting to make the decision through an ultimatum.\n\n6. **Student Loans:** She has significant debt from attending a state school instead of a \"real\" school, which her dad could have supported. This adds to the financial burden, making her quitting work more problematic.\n\n7. **Communication Issues:** The main issue here is communication. They had a plan, but she changed her mind without discussing it properly. The author's reaction is about financial reality and unmet expectations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial reality and the agreed-upon plans. However, breaking off the engagement over this could be seen as a hardline stance. But considering the financial implications and the fact that they had a prior agreement, it's a valid reason to reconsider the marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, she might feel that her personal choice to be a homemaker is her right, and the author is not respecting her decision. But since they had a mutual plan, her unilateral change could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe key points are financial feasibility and mutual agreement. The author is trying to protect their future, which is a responsible stance. However, the way he's handling it (ultimatum) could be problematic. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not the method. Since the financial reality makes their future unsustainable without her income, he's justified in backing out. \n\nSo, answer B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
