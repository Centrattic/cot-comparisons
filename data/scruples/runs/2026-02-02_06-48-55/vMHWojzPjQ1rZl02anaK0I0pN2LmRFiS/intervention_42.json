Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's engaged to a woman, and she just quit her job because she wants to be a wife and not work anymore. The guy is upset because they both have a lot of student debt and they need her income to survive, especially if they have a kid soon. The question is whether he's the asshole (AITA) if he backs out of the engagement because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The guy's perspective: they have financial issues, they need her income. He didn't know she planned to quit immediately after marriage, and she went to a local school instead of a better one where she could have had less debt. Now she's quitting, and she and her mom support this decision. Her dad is more level-headed and even tells the guy not to feel guilty if he backs out.\n\nOn her side, maybe she felt that marriage is like her mom's situation, where the husband supports the family. Her father made her mom quit her job, so maybe she expects the same. She might not realize the financial strain it would put on them. Also, she might think that since her dad helped them with the house, they can manage. But maybe she didn't have plans to work again, which is a problem.\n\nNow, the guy's argument is that they need her income. If she quits, they can't afford to have kids or manage their debts. He proposed because he thought they had a plan where she'd work part-time later, but she changed her mind. He's not wealthy like her dad, so he can't support her financially. He's in a bind because he doesn't want to marry someone who's not going to contribute.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, expectations in marriage, and communication. Did he communicate his expectations clearly? The original plan was for her to work part-time after a kid, but she changed her mind. Maybe there wasn't enough discussion about financial needs and roles in marriage. \n\nHe's considering giving her an ultimatum, but he also thinks that's not healthy. However, he's at a point where he can't proceed if her decision makes the marriage financially unsustainable. Is it wrong for him to prioritize financial stability? Or is he being too rigid?\n\nHer side: She might feel that marriage is a traditional role where the wife stays home. But given their financial situation, that's not feasible. She might not have considered the long-term implications of quitting her job. Also, her mother's example might have influenced her, but if her father is wealthier, maybe she didn't think about the reality.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is he wrong to back out? If the marriage can't be financially sustainable without her income, then he's justified in stepping back. He's not willing to take on a spouse who's not contributing when it's necessary. So, maybe he's right to back out. On the other hand, maybe he should have addressed this before proposing, but he did mention they had a plan. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not considering her perspective enough. She might be making a sacrifice (quitting her job) for their relationship, but if it's financially irresponsible, then maybe he's correct. The father's advice is that he shouldn't be expected to support a family if he's not in a position to do so. So the dad supports the guy's decision to back out.\n\nI think the main issue is the mismatch in expectations. The guy expected her to work part-time later, but she wanted to quit immediately. Since they can't afford it, he's in a position where he can't proceed. So he's not the one in the wrong here. The answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
