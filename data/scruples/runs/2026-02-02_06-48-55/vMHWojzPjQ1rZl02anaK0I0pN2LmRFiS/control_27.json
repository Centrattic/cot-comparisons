Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The question is whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage, even though they had previously planned for her to work part-time after having a kid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father expects his wife to stay home. The author and his fianc\u00e9e both have student debt and aren't financially stable. They had a plan where she would work part-time until their child starts pre-K, but now she's quit her job because she wants to be a full-time homemaker, possibly influenced by her mother's example. The author can't support the family on his income alone, and they need her income for their planned child. He's considering breaking up unless she goes back to work.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. Financial responsibility and debt. Both have significant student loans and need her income to survive.\n2. Prior plans vs. her sudden change. They had discussed a timeline for her working part-time after a child, but she's quitting now.\n3. The influence of her family's wealth and her father's expectations.\n4. The ultimatum the author is considering\u2014marry her or she doesn't work.\n\nTo assess if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e might feel she's entitled to not work because of her family's example, but the author is in a different financial situation. He's not as wealthy as her father and can't support a family without her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job now disrupts their previous agreement and financial planning.\n\nThe author is standing by his original plan, which was realistic given their financial status. If he backs out, he's making a tough decision but one that's based on practicality. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without discussing it thoroughly, possibly not considering the financial implications. The author isn't being unfair by sticking to the plan they had; he's prioritizing their future stability. Her decision to quit without considering the financial burden on him might be the issue here. Her mother's support for this decision suggests it's more about her family's values rather than their financial reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's ultimatum could be seen as harsh, but he's not the one who suddenly changed the plan. He's trying to maintain the financial stability they discussed. The fianc\u00e9e may have unrealistic expectations based on her father's wealth, which isn't applicable to their situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for backing out because he's protecting their financial future. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision to quit without considering the practical aspects is the main issue. The author's stance is about responsibility and their shared financial realities.\n"
