  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e have been dating for 3.5 years. They both have significant student debt and can't afford a house without her father's help. The fianc\u00e9e's father is wealthy and made her mother quit her job when they married. Now, after the proposal, she quits her job, saying she wants to be a homemaker. The author is upset because their financial situation requires her income, especially if they plan to have a kid. He feels she didn't plan to use her degree and took loans unnecessarily. He's considering an ultimatum: work or break up.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for backing out. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide.\n\nI should consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit might be influenced by her family's example. Her father's wealth allowed her mother to stay home. However, their current financial situation isn't the same. The author is worried about their ability to support a family without her income. He wants her to work part-time later, but she's decided against it. The fianc\u00e9e's choice might be seen as selfish if it's financially impractical. On the other hand, she could argue that she's following her family's example and that staying home is her choice. \n\nThe author's position is about financial responsibility. He's not in a position to support a family alone, and her decision changes their initial plan. He's not forcing her to work, but he's reconsidering the marriage because of this. Is it fair to expect someone to work if they want to stay home? It depends on mutual agreement and financial feasibility. Since their plans were different, the author's decision to back out might be about financial reality rather than being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's father supports the author backing out if needed, which adds some validation. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because his decision is based on practical concerns, not just controlling her choices.\n"
