  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the given situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e quitting her job after the proposal. The author is upset because they need her income for their future, especially with plans to have kids. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit seems to contradict their previous plan of her working for a few years after the child starts pre-K. She also went to a state school instead of a more expensive one, leading to more debt. Her father supported her mother by making her quit her job, which might have influenced her expectations.\n\nThe author is now considering an ultimatum: work or not get married. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out. \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid financial concerns. They both have significant debt and need her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision could jeopardize their financial stability. The author isn't wealthy like her father, so they can't afford to support a family on his income alone. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her intention to quit before the proposal, which is a major issue. They had a prior agreement, but she changed her mind after the proposal, which might be a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that after the proposal, she's entitled to leave her job, especially if the author proposed because he believed she would continue to work. Her parents' influence, particularly her father's example, might have led her to expect that a spouse would support the family financially. However, the author's financial situation is different, which is a key point.\n\nThe author's consideration of an ultimatum is a tough call. Marriage requires mutual agreement on major life decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e is unwilling to work when necessary, it's a significant problem. The author isn't in a position to support a family alone, so expecting her to work is reasonable. The fact that her mother supports her decision but her father is more level-headed might indicate that the fianc\u00e9e isn't fully considering the financial realities.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for recognizing that they can't sustain the lifestyle they plan on with just his income. The fianc\u00e9e made a decision that affects both their financial stability without prior communication. The author's financial planning is also reasonable, considering their debts and future plans. The ultimatum is a hard decision, but it's about their shared future. The author isn't being unreasonable in standing by his financial needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
