Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's engaged to someone who just quit her job because she wants to stop working once they get married. They have a lot of student debt and can't afford a house without her income. The author is considering backing out of the engagement because he can't support a family on his own. He's asking if he's the a**hole (AITA) if he gives her an ultimatum to work or else not get married.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's perspective is that they need her income to survive, especially if they have a kid. They had a plan that she would work part-time later, but now she wants to quit entirely. He feels that she's not being realistic about their financial situation. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's side is that her father didn't work after getting married, so she wants to follow that example. She might feel that her role as a wife doesn't require her to work, especially since her family is wealthy.\n\nNow, considering the principles of marriage, communication, and mutual support. The key issue here is financial responsibility and shared plans. The author and his fianc\u00e9e had a prior agreement about her working part-time after having a kid, but she changed her mind after the proposal. That seems like a major shift in their plans without prior discussion. The author is concerned about their financial stability and future, which is valid. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision to quit her job unilaterally might be seen as not considering their shared financial responsibilities. Even though her family's example is to have one parent stay home, that might not be feasible for them given their debt. The author is not in a position to support a family on his income alone, so expecting him to do so could be unrealistic. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's educational choices and debt are part of the problem. She took on student loans for a degree that she wasn't planning to use, which adds to their financial burden. The author is justified in questioning the practicality of her decision, especially when it affects their combined ability to manage debt and future plans.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering an ultimatum, which could be seen as harsh. Marriage should be based on mutual agreement and support, not a forced decision. But in this case, the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in plans might have broken the initial understanding they had. The author has a right to be concerned about their financial future and whether they can support a family together.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he backs out because he can't afford to support a family without her income, he's acting in their best interest. On the other hand, if he's only doing this because of financial reasons without considering her perspective, it might not be fair. But given that they had a plan and she changed it without discussion, the author's decision to reevaluate the engagement is understandable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because he's addressing a significant financial issue that affects their future together.\n"
