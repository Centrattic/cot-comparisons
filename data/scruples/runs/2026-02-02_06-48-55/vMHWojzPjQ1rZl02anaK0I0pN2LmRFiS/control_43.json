Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (the author) is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided not to work after marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e have been dating for 3.5 years. She comes from a wealthy family; her father is successful in construction. Her dad made her mother quit her job when he married her. Now, after the engagement, she quits her job, leading to a fight. The author is worried they can't afford to live, especially with planned kids and their debts. He feels she should work part-time until the kid starts school. She wants to stay home forever, and her mom supports her. The author is considering an ultimatum: work or break up.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, differing expectations about work and marriage, and the influence of her father's example. The author is in a different financial position compared to her father. They both have debts and need her income. She chose a local college over a more affordable one for her boyfriend at the time, leading to more debt. They had a plan for her to work part-time after the kid starts school, but now she's changing it.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the author wrong for not wanting to marry someone who won't contribute financially? He's not in a position to support a family alone. Her decision to quit seems to disregard their current financial realities. The author is trying to be realistic, considering their debts and the cost of living. However, she's following her mother's example, which was possible because her father was wealthy. The author isn't wealthy, so the same choice might not be feasible.\n\nOn the other hand, she might feel entitled to not work after marriage, especially influenced by her family's example. But the author isn't her father, so expecting him to support her is a different scenario. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for backing out. If he's being realistic about their financial situation and she's making a choice that could strain their relationship and financial stability, he's justified in wanting to back out. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but it's about compatibility in life goals.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a responsible decision based on their financial situation and future plans. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
