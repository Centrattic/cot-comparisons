  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married?\nA bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person breaking off an engagement because their fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore after getting married. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her father had her mother quit her job after marriage. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is doing the same, but the author feels they can't financially support a family on his income alone, especially with student loans and plans for a child. They had a previous plan for her to return to work part-time after the child starts school, but she changed her mind after the proposal.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, personal freedom, and communication. The author is concerned about their financial stability and the practicality of their future together. They had a plan, but she changed her stance, leading to a conflict. The father-in-law is supportive of the author's decision if they back out, which adds pressure.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The author is making a decision based on their financial situation and the need for mutual support in a marriage. They're not forcing her to work, but they're choosing not to proceed if she won't contribute financially. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has the right to her own choices, including not working, especially if her family has provided a home. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability and realistic planning for their future together. There's no indication that the author is being cruel, just practical. The engagement was a major step, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her commitment after the proposal, which the author is addressing before marriage. So, the author is not in the wrong here because they're making a responsible decision based on their circumstances.\n"
