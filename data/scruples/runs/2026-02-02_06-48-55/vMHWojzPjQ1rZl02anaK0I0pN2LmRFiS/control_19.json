Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for backing out of the engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work anymore once they get married.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation details. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family where her dad was successful. Her dad told her mom to quit her job when they got married. Now the fianc\u00e9e, who is 26, has been working, but after the proposal, she quits her job, expecting to stay home. The author, 28, has student debt and their financial situation is not stable. They need her income to survive, especially if they plan to have a kid soon.\n\nThe author is upset because they had a plan where she would work for a few years and then maybe part-time later. Now she's changing her mind post-proposal, and her mom supports this. The author is considering giving her an ultimatum: work or break up. But he's unsure if that's the right move and if he's in the wrong for backing out.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, differing expectations about work after marriage, and the ultimatum. The author is worried about their combined debt and the necessity of her income. The fianc\u00e9e's decision seems abrupt and changes their previously agreed-upon plan. Her decision might be influenced by her family's example, but the author's financial situation is different from her dad's.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to protect their financial stability. If her quitting now would cause significant financial strain, especially with plans to have a child, it's understandable. However, ultimatums can be harsh, but the author feels it's necessary. The fianc\u00e9e's change in plans without prior discussion could be seen as the issue. The author isn't forcing her to work per se but is standing by their pre-existing plan, which required both incomes. If she didn't communicate this intent before the proposal, she might be the one at fault. The author is acting in self-preservation, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
