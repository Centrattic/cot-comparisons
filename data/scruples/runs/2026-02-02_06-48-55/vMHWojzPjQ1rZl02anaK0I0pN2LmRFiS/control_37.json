Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for backing out of an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e decided she doesn't want to work once they're married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a wealthy family. Her father ran a successful business and told her mom to quit her job once they married. Now she's doing the same, but they can't afford for her to stop working. They both have student debt, and the house they have was given by her dad. He's not in a position to support a family alone, especially with the debt. The fianc\u00e9e didn't plan to use her degree and took on loans for a school she could have avoided if she went to her dad's choice. Now she's resigned, which caused a fight. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to marry someone who won't work, but he also doesn't want to make it an ultimatum.\n\nSo, is the author right to back out? Let's see. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to stop working is a major life choice that affects their financial stability. The author is concerned about their ability to support a family, manage debt, and plan for a child. The fianc\u00e9e's plan doesn't align with their previous agreement, which was to work until their kid starts school. She changed her mind after the proposal, which is a significant shift.\n\nMarriage requires mutual agreement on major issues like financial responsibilities. If one person is making a decision that directly impacts the other's ability to support the family, that's a legitimate concern. The author is not in a position like her father was, so forcing him to support her without her contributing could be a burden. The fianc\u00e9e's family's support (dad's understanding) adds another layer, but the author's financial situation is real.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel she's entitled to not work, following her mom's example. However, that example might not be feasible for their circumstances. The author isn't opposing her choice in principle but in practice due to their financial situation. The ultimatum is a tough choice, but the author is trying to address a real problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on their shared financial reality. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to stop working without considering their financial constraints is the issue here. The author is prioritizing their future stability, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
