(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation is that the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. The family doesn't like the girlfriend for various reasons, including her role in the breakup. The author and family have decided not to include her, but the SO disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the family's feelings towards the girlfriend and the uncle's past actions. The uncle cheated, which is a significant betrayal. The family still has unresolved feelings, and they don't like the girlfriend. Including her on the Christmas card might be seen as condoning the relationship or the cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the SO argues that moving on and accepting the current family situation is better. But the author and family feel that not respecting their uncle's choice (to be with the woman) is their stance. The question is whether the family's decision is justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's about respect and forgiveness. If the family refuses to acknowledge the girlfriend, maybe they're holding onto past hurt. But given the circumstances (cheating), it's also about their discomfort with the woman involved. The author is following their family's lead. \n\nHowever, excluding someone from a Christmas card is a small gesture but might send a message of disapproval. The author isn't harming the girlfriend directly, just choosing not to include her in the card. If the family is uncomfortable, maybe they have valid reasons. But is it wrong to exclude her? It's a judgment call. If the author's actions are based on personal and family feelings, they might not be in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because it's their choice to make based on their feelings and family dynamics.\n"
