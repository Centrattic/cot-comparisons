(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, getting divorced, and now being with a woman the family doesn't like. The family doesn't want to include her, but the SO thinks they should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle cheated, which is a big deal. The family is still upset, and they don't like the girlfriend. They might be holding a grudge. But on the other hand, the uncle is part of the family and now in a new relationship. Is it fair to exclude his partner just because of past issues? \n\nThe author's parents agree not to include her, but the SO is conflicted. The SO's perspective is about moving on and focusing on the present. The question is about whether the author is an asshole for not including the girlfriend. \n\nIncluding someone on a Christmas card is a gesture of goodwill. If the family is still resentful, maybe excluding her is a way of expressing that. But is that justified? It might be seen as holding a grudge against the girlfriend for the uncle's past actions. However, the girlfriend isn't the one who cheated; she was the other woman. The family might be blaming her for causing the divorce. \n\nBut the author and family are choosing not to respect the uncle's current relationship. Is that fair? The uncle made a mistake, but now he's in a new relationship. The family's disapproval might be affecting the uncle's current happiness. \n\nOn the other hand, the family's feelings are valid. They were hurt by the cheating. The girlfriend's presence might be a reminder of the betrayal. The author is in a tough spot between family loyalty and moving past the past. \n\nThe key points are: the uncle's actions, the family's feelings, and the girlfriend's role. The author isn't the one who cheated, but they are choosing to exclude the girlfriend. Is that fair? Maybe the author is in the right because the family's feelings are legitimate. Or is the author being judgmental towards a third party who isn't responsible for the uncle's actions? \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to include her, considering the family's feelings and the uncle's past. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but I'm not sure. The SO's argument is about moving on, but the author's stance is based on family's justified hurt. So, the answer is B.\n"
