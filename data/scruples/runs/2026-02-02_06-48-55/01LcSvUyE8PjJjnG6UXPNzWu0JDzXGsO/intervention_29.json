(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, the family being upset, and now the uncle is dating this woman again. The author's family doesn't like her and doesn't want to include her, even though they still see the uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The uncle did cheat, which is a significant betrayal. The family is still hurt, and the new girlfriend is associated with the cheating. They don't like her because of her attitude and the fact that she came between the uncle and aunt. Now, the author and their SO are debating whether to include her in the Christmas card. The author's parents advise against it, while the SO is more lenient.\n\nSo, the main question is about respect and boundaries. Family relationships can be complex. The author might feel that including the girlfriend would show acceptance, but the family's feelings are valid given the past. On the other hand, not including her might be seen as holding a grudge. But if the family has reasons not to like her, maybe they're justified in not including her.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. Christmas cards are often sent to family members, and including a partner might be expected if they're in a long-term relationship. However, if the family is uncomfortable with the partner, it's a personal choice. The key is whether the author is being disrespectful by not including someone. But since the uncle is still part of the family, maybe the author is just following their family's wishes. Alternatively, the SO's perspective is that moving forward is better.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is being disrespectful by excluding someone who is now a part of their uncle's life. However, the author's family has valid reasons for their discomfort. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are respecting their family's feelings. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they are following their family's advice and have a legitimate reason for their decision.\n"
