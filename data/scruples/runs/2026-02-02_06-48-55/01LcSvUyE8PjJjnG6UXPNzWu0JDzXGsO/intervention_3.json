(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The uncle cheated, leading to the divorce, and now the family doesn't like the girlfriend. The author's parents advised against including her, while the SO thinks it's better to move on. The family's reasons are based on past events and their dislike of the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. Cheating is a serious issue, and the family's decision to distance themselves from the uncle could be a way of coping. But does that justify excluding the new partner? Christmas cards are usually a gesture of goodwill, so excluding someone might hurt feelings, especially if the family still interacts with the uncle and his partner at gatherings.\n\nThe SO's perspective is about moving past the past, which is a valid approach. The family might feel that by not including the girlfriend, they're punishing the uncle for his actions. However, the uncle is now with someone else who's part of his current life. The family's disapproval could affect the partner unfairly if she's not the one who cheated. \n\nOn the other hand, the family has their reasons rooted in their relationship with the uncle and the aunt. They might be protecting their feelings and the memory of the past. But in terms of being respectful to the uncle and his current partner, including them in the card is a socially expected gesture unless there's a clear boundary set by the uncle himself. \n\nThe author's decision is based on family consensus, but it's important to consider the impact on the uncle and his partner. If the uncle hasn't asked to exclude his girlfriend from such gestures, then the family might be overstepping. The key here is whether the exclusion is a personal choice between the family and the uncle, or if it's affecting the new partner without her wrongdoing. \n\nIn conclusion, while the family has their reasons, excluding someone from a holiday card based on past events might come across as holding a grudge. It's more respectful to acknowledge the current relationships, even if there's lingering hurt from the past. So, the author might be in the wrong for not including the girlfriend.\n"
