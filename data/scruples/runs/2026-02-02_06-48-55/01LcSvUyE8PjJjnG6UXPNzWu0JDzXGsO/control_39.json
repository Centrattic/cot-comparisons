(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. \n\nFirst, the situation: The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with a new partner, the girlfriend. The family doesn't like her because of her attitude and the fact she came between the uncle and aunt. They're sending out Christmas cards and debating whether to include the girlfriend.\n\nThe author and their family decided not to include her, but the SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad. The parents agree with the author. The SO has a different perspective because their own family had divorces but no cheating. \n\nSo, the key points here are the family's feelings and the past actions of the uncle. The user is wondering if they're being an asshole by excluding the girlfriend. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and family dynamics. Christmas cards are often a formality, but they can also be a way to acknowledge relationships. However, if the family is uncomfortable with the girlfriend due to past wrongs, is it their responsibility to include her? \n\nThe uncle's actions (cheating) caused the divorce. The family might still be upset. Including the girlfriend might be seen as endorsing the new relationship, which the family isn't comfortable with. On the other hand, excluding her could be seen as holding a grudge or being disrespectful to the uncle's current partner. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who cheated; it was the uncle. The family's decision to exclude the girlfriend is a personal choice. They might not want to acknowledge her role in the previous breakdown. The SO's suggestion to move on might be more about letting go of the past, but the family's feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal boundaries. The author isn't obligated to include someone they don't like. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like sending a separate card to the uncle without the girlfriend's name. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for their current choice. \n\nSince the uncle is still part of the family (they still see him), but the relationship is strained, the author's decision to exclude the girlfriend is based on their family's feelings. It's not about the girlfriend's actions directly but the past cheating. The author isn't being disrespectful to the uncle by not including the girlfriend, but maybe to the girlfriend. However, the main issue is the uncle's past. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They are respecting their family's feelings and past experiences.\n"
