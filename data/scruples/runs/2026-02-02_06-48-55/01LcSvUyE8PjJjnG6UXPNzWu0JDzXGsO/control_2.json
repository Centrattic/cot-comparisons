(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on a Christmas card. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce, and the family doesn't like the new girlfriend. The family and the author think not including her is okay, but the SO thinks it might look bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle cheated, which is a serious betrayal. The family is still upset, even though they see him sometimes. They don't like the new girlfriend because of her attitude and the fact that she's with the uncle after the divorce. So the family's dislike is rooted in the past infidelity and the current relationship.\n\nThe author's parents agree not to include the girlfriend. The SO is conflicted, suggesting that excluding her could look bad. The author is torn but sides with their family. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom one perspective, the author's family's feelings are valid. They have a reason to be upset with the uncle for cheating, and the girlfriend is associated with the betrayal. The family might be using the Christmas card as a way to signal their disapproval. Since the uncle's actions caused the rift, the family might feel justified in not acknowledging the new relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that moving on and being polite is more important, especially if the uncle is now part of the family events again without the ex. Including the girlfriend could be seen as a gesture of acceptance and letting go of past issues. The SO's point is about how it looks\u2014maybe the girlfriend could feel excluded, or the uncle might be hurt if the girlfriend isn't mentioned.\n\nBut in this case, the family's disapproval isn't just about the girlfriend; it's about the uncle's past actions. The girlfriend is part of the situation but not the cause. The author and family are not the ones who wronged anyone here. They are reacting to the uncle's behavior. So, their decision is based on their own feelings and values. It's their choice to express in the card. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't being malicious. They're not targeting the girlfriend for her own faults but the situation she's in. Since the uncle is the one who caused the family pain, the author isn't in the wrong for not including the girlfriend. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
