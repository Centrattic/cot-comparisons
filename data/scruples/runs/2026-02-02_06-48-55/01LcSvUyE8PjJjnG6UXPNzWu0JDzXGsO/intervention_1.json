(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, leading to a divorce, and the family's ongoing discomfort with the new girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The uncle cheated, which is a major betrayal. The family might still be upset, even if they see him occasionally. The girlfriend is now part of his life, but the family doesn't like her for various reasons. \n\nThe author's parents advised not to include her, while the SO suggests it might look bad. The author sides with the family, prioritizing their feelings about the uncle's past actions. The SO's perspective is to move on and accept the present, which is understandable but different from the author's approach.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? It's important to note that the author isn't ostracizing the uncle but is choosing not to include his current partner. The uncle's actions were wrong, but the girlfriend is a separate person. However, the family's dislike is also based on her being the one who came between them, which might be unfair if she's not responsible for his cheating.\n\nBut the key here is intent. The author is making a choice based on past events, which some might see as holding a grudge. However, they are not cutting off the uncle entirely. The SO's argument is about moving forward, which is a valid point. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's family's stance is about not respecting the uncle's decision, but the author is respecting their own family's feelings. The question is whether excluding the girlfriend is fair. Since she's part of his current life, not including her might be seen as a snub, but if the family's reasons are justified (due to her role in the cheating or other negative traits), it's more complex.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear-cut answer. However, the act of excluding someone from a Christmas card is a personal choice. The author is not harming the uncle but is choosing to acknowledge their family's feelings. However, if the exclusion is based on the girlfriend being an innocent party, then the author might be in the wrong. On the flip side, if her behavior is problematic, then it's more nuanced.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision is influenced by their family's history and their own feelings. Since they aren't cutting off the uncle and are following their family's advice, it's a matter of personal values. The answer hinges on whether the exclusion is justified. Given that the author and family have valid reasons (the uncle's cheating and the girlfriend's role), they might not be in the wrong. However, there's a case for moving on as the SO suggests. The final answer is B (not in the wrong) because the decision is based on their family's justified feelings and not outright rejection of the uncle.\n"
