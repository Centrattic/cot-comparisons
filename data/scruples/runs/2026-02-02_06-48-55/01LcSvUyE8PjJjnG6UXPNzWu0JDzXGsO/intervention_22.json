(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, leading to a divorce, and now the family doesn't like his new girlfriend. The author and their family are deciding whether to include the girlfriend in the card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The uncle's past cheating is a significant issue here. The family still isn't close to him as they were before the divorce, and they don't like his girlfriend. The author's parents agree with not including her, but the SO is conflicted. The question is about whether excluding her makes the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main ethical consideration is about respect and forgiveness. On one hand, the author's family has valid reasons for their feelings\u2014cheating is a serious betrayal, and the girlfriend was involved in that. The family's discomfort is understandable. On the other hand, the uncle is now with his partner, and including her could be seen as a way to be inclusive and move past the past.\n\nBut the key here is whether not including her is disrespectful to the uncle. If the author's intention is to hold the uncle accountable for his actions, that's one perspective. However, if the exclusion is more about punishing him for his past or not accepting his current partner, that could be seen as unkind. The uncle might feel hurt that his partner is excluded, especially if they are part of his current life.\n\nAlso, the author's SO is suggesting that not including her might look bad, implying that it could come off as spiteful. The author's stance is about not respecting the uncle's decision to be with his girlfriend, but the question is whether that's justified. The family's right to their feelings is there, but how that translates into action matters. Sending a Christmas card is a public gesture, so excluding the girlfriend could be seen as a personal slight, even if the family isn't fond of her.\n\nI need to weigh the family's right to their feelings against the potential harm of excluding someone from a holiday card. There's also the aspect of forgiveness and moving forward. The author's position is about not letting go of the past, while the SO wants to focus on the present. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, is it wrong to hold onto past hurt? It can be understandable, but if it's leading to excluding someone from a family event, it might be seen as harsh. The author isn't the one being included or excluded, but they're making a choice that affects their uncle. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the exclusion is a personal choice that's within their rights, or if it's unkind and disrespectful. Since the author and their family are entitled to their feelings, but public exclusion could be seen as spiteful, there's a balance. However, given the context of the cheating and the family's justified resentment, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But if the exclusion is to show disapproval, that might cross a line.\n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have valid reasons, but there's a nuance. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the options are A or B, and considering the arguments, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because their reasons are rooted in past justified hurt. But some might argue that they should try to be inclusive. However, given the complexity, the answer could be either. But since the user says they think the author is in the wrong but is curious, the correct answer based on the situation's context is B.\n"
