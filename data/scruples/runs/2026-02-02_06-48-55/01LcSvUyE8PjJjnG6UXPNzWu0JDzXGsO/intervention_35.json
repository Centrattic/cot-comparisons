(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The context is that the uncle cheated, leading to divorce, and now the family doesn't like the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family still interacts with the uncle but has issues with the girlfriend. The author's parents advised against including her, and the SO is conflicted. The author's stance is not to include her, while the SO thinks it's better to move on.\n\nCheating is a sensitive topic. The uncle's actions caused the divorce, and the girlfriend was involved in that. The family's dislike of her might stem from resentment towards her role in the breakdown of the marriage. However, excluding someone from a Christmas card might be seen as a personal choice, but it could also be viewed as being disrespectful or holding a grudge.\n\nThe SO's argument is about moving past the past. Christmas cards are typically for current relationships, so maybe the SO is right in wanting to acknowledge the present relationship. But the author and family feel they can't respect the uncle's decision to be with this woman, given the circumstances.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author is justified in their stance. The family's feelings are valid, but excluding someone might be seen as cutting off a relative. However, the author isn't excluding the uncle, just the girlfriend. The card is going to the uncle, not her. The question is if it's wrong to not include the girlfriend.\n\nBut in Christmas cards, usually, you include the person's current partner. Not including them could be seen as a slight, even if the main recipient is the uncle. The author's parents advise against it, which suggests family solidarity in this decision. However, the SO's concern is about how it looks, implying that it might be perceived as not accepting the uncle's current situation.\n\nThe key points are: the uncle's past actions, the family's ongoing discomfort, and the social norms around holiday cards. The author isn't being disrespectful to the uncle, just not acknowledging the girlfriend. Whether that's being an asshole depends on intent and perspective. If the author is being petty or holding a grudge, that's one thing. If it's about respecting boundaries due to the past actions, another.\n\nIn the end, the author's choice is a personal one. While there's no right or wrong answer, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the family's reasons are valid, then maybe not. But societal norms might lean towards including current partners. However, the author isn't obligated to send a card at all. Since they are sending one to the uncle, the decision to exclude the girlfriend could be a personal boundary, which isn't necessarily wrong. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
