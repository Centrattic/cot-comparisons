(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated on his wife, leading to a divorce. The family is still not close with him, and they don't like his girlfriend. The author and their family have multiple reasons for disliking her, including her role in the divorce and her attitude. Now, when sending a Christmas card to the uncle, there's a debate about whether to include the girlfriend. The author's parents advise against it, while their SO thinks it's better to move on and include her. The author is conflicted but sides with their family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider different angles. On one hand, the uncle is part of the family, and his current partner is now part of his life. Excluding her could be seen as being hostile or holding a grudge. The SO's perspective is that it's about moving forward and accepting the present. On the other hand, the author and family have valid reasons for their feelings\u2014cheating is a serious issue, and the girlfriend was involved in the breakdown of the marriage. The family's discomfort is understandable, especially since they're still not close with the uncle.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to make a political statement by including or excluding someone in a Christmas card? Christmas cards are personal, and people often choose whom to address based on their relationships. The author might feel that acknowledging the girlfriend would imply approval of the uncle's actions or the relationship. However, others might argue that the uncle is a family member, and the card is to him, not necessarily to her.\n\nThe key factors here are intention and context. The author isn't avoiding the uncle but is choosing whom to address on the card. Since the family has a history of tension, their decision not to include the girlfriend might be a way to avoid further conflict or to express their disapproval. The SO's concern about what others might think is more about social perception than the actual relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't being cruel or cutting off the uncle; they're just maintaining a boundary based on past actions. The uncle is still included in the card, just not his girlfriend. That seems like a personal choice, especially given the family's feelings. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural or social norm I'm missing here. In many cases, people choose who to include based on their comfort levels, so this seems reasonable.\n"
