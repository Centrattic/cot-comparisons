(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author's uncle cheated on his ex-wife, leading to a divorce. Now the uncle is with a new girlfriend, and the family doesn't like her because of their past experiences. The author and their family don't want to include the girlfriend in a Christmas card to the uncle. The author's significant other thinks it's better to include her for the sake of moving on, but the family advises against it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not including the girlfriend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. \n\nFirst, consider the reasons the family doesn't like the girlfriend. They mention her attitude and that she was the one who caused the divorce. However, the uncle is the one who cheated, which complicates things. The girlfriend's role here is a bit unclear. Is she the one who cheated, or is she the one the uncle cheated with? The original statement says the uncle cheated on his aunt, so the girlfriend was involved in an affair. Now, she's his girlfriend again. The family might hold her responsible for the breakdown of the marriage, but technically, the uncle was the one who cheated. \n\nThen there's the aspect of family dynamics. The family is still in contact with the uncle but relations are strained. The author and family are choosing to exclude the girlfriend from a Christmas card. The SO is suggesting that not including her might look bad. The SO's perspective is to \"let the past go,\" which is about moving forward. The author's family is more about holding onto negative feelings from the past.\n\nThe key points here are whether the family's judgment of the girlfriend is fair. If the uncle is responsible for the cheating, then maybe the family is projecting their anger at the current girlfriend. There's also the social aspect of including people in cards. Christmas cards are a social gesture, and excluding someone might be seen as a slight. However, if the family genuinely doesn't like the girlfriend, is it their responsibility to include her despite their feelings?\n\nAnother angle is forgiveness and moving on. The SO's argument is that they should focus on the present relationship. The author's position is that they can't forget the past. The uncle is now in a relationship with the woman, so maybe it's time for the family to accept her as part of his life, even if they don't like her. \n\nBut is it the author's place to judge the uncle's current relationship? The uncle is an adult and can make his own choices. The family might feel hurt and want to express that by excluding her, but doing so could be seen as holding a grudge against a third person who isn't their family. The original wrongdoing was the uncle's, not the girlfriend's, unless she was also complicit. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to include people in holiday greetings if they are part of the recipient's life. Excluding them might cause hurt feelings. However, if there's a negative perception towards the person, the family might feel justified. But is it fair to involve the girlfriend in the uncle's past? The author might be conflating the uncle's actions with the girlfriend's. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because they are dealing with their family's feelings. However, there's a case to be made that including the girlfriend is more respectful to the uncle's current situation, even if the family doesn't approve. But if the family has valid reasons (like the woman being the one who caused the divorce, which isn't clear), then it's different. Wait, the original statement says the uncle cheated, not the girlfriend. The family might be blaming the girlfriend for the divorce because she was involved, but technically she's not the one who was married to the aunt. The uncle was the one who cheated, so the responsibility lies with him. \n\nIn that case, excluding the girlfriend might be holding her responsible for the uncle's actions, which isn't fair. The family might dislike her for being involved with the uncle, but that's their own judgment. The author and family might be in the wrong for not including her if they're punishing her for the uncle's past actions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including the girlfriend in the Christmas card, as it could be seen as a judgment on her rather than the uncle. Alternatively, if the family genuinely doesn't like her, maybe they're not wrong, but the line is thin between personal feelings and social etiquette.\n"
