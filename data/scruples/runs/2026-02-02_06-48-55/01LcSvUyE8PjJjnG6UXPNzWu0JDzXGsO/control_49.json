(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, the family's dislike of the girlfriend, and the debate between the author's stance and the SO's view.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. The family still sees him but relations aren't the same. The girlfriend is involved now, and the family doesn't like her for various reasons. The author's family says not to include her, but the SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about family dynamics and boundaries. The family's feelings are hurt by the uncle's actions, and they might not want to acknowledge the new relationship as a way of showing disapproval. On the other hand, including the girlfriend could be seen as being polite and moving on, especially if they still interact with the uncle. \n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to include someone the family dislikes? The author's family's perspective is that they don't respect the uncle's decision (referring to the cheating and being with the girlfriend). The SO suggests letting the past go, but the author's family is still upset. \n\nIt's a matter of personal feelings and family values. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the family collectively decides not to include her. However, there's a social norm to be inclusive, but that might not apply if there's lingering resentment. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's their family's choice based on their feelings towards the situation. They aren't obligated to include someone they don't respect, especially after such a hurtful event.\n"
