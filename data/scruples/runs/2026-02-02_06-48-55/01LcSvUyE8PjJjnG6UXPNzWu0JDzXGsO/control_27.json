(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on a Christmas card. The situation involves their uncle cheating on their aunt, which led to a divorce. Now the uncle is with another woman who the family doesn't like. The family, including the author and their parents, decided not to include her, while the SO thinks it's better to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the family has for not including her. They mention the woman's attitude and the fact that she was the one who caused the break between the uncle and aunt. The family doesn't like her or respect the uncle anymore. The author's parents advised against including her, so the author followed that. The SO's perspective is more about moving past the past, especially since they've had divorces before without cheating.\n\nIs the author wrong for not including her? Well, Christmas cards are a personal choice. It's a family tradition, and they're making a judgment based on their family's feelings. The uncle's relationship with the new partner is part of his life now, but the family's feelings are valid. However, some might argue that excluding the partner could be seen as holding a grudge, especially if the uncle has moved on. But the author's stance is that they don't respect the uncle's decision (maybe about the relationship), so not including her might be their way of showing that. It's a sensitive area, but since it's their card, they have the right to decide who to include. They aren't necessarily in the wrong for following their family's wishes. The answer would be B.\n"
