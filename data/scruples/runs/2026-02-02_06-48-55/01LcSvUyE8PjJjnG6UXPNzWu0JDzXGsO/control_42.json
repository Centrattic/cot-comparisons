(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves family dynamics, past cheating, and current relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. The family still sees him but isn't the same. They don't like his new girlfriend for various reasons, including her role in the divorce. The author and family decided not to include her in the Christmas card, but the SO is conflicted, thinking it's rude to exclude her now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A or B. I need to evaluate the ethics here. On one hand, the family has a valid reason for their discomfort due to the uncle's cheating and the girlfriend's role. On the other hand, the uncle is part of the family, and maybe the author should focus on current relationships, not past issues.\n\nBut the author's family is choosing to exclude the girlfriend because of their disapproval, which might be seen as holding a grudge. However, it's also about personal feelings and respect. The SO's perspective is to move on, but the author's stance is supported by family. \n\nI should consider if excluding someone from a card is a significant enough issue to label the author as an asshole. It's a personal choice in a family matter. The author isn't being disrespectful to the uncle, just not acknowledging the girlfriend. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because it's their decision based on their feelings and family's stance.\n"
