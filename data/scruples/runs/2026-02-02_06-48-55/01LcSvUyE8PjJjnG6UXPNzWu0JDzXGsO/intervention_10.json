(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author's uncle cheated on his wife, leading to a divorce. Now the uncle is in a relationship with the same woman and brings her to family gatherings. The author and their family don't like this new girlfriend due to her attitude and the fact that she caused the divorce. They're sending Christmas cards and debating whether to include her. The parents say no, the SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad not to include her. The author is torn but sides with the family.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of forgiveness and moving on. The uncle's past actions are a big deal\u2014cheating is a serious betrayal. The family's feelings towards the uncle and his new partner are justified because of the hurt caused. However, sending a Christmas card is a gesture of goodwill and inclusion, even if there's lingering resentment. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing not to include the girlfriend. On one hand, the family has every right to be upset about the cheating. The girlfriend was part of that betrayal, so excluding her might be a way to show disapproval. On the other hand, the uncle is now in a new relationship, and including his current partner in the card could be seen as acknowledging his current life, even if they don't like the past. The SO's argument is about letting the past go and being present-focused, which is a valid perspective. \n\nBut the family's stance is that they don't respect the uncle's decision to be with this woman, given the circumstances. Sending a card without her might send a message of disapproval, but maybe that's okay. It's their choice to express their feelings. The SO is concerned about appearances, thinking it might look like they're being judgmental or holding a grudge. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author's family has a right to their feelings. If they want to show that they don't support the uncle's current relationship, excluding the girlfriend's name from the card could be a way to express that. However, just because they don't like her doesn't mean they have to include her in the card. But maybe the issue is about being polite versus being judgmental. \n\nIncluding someone in a Christmas card is a kind gesture, but it's also a personal choice. The author is not obligated to include the girlfriend. The SO's concern is that it might look bad, but the author and family are prioritizing their feelings over social niceties. That seems reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to express their feelings and make their own decisions about what to include in the card. The past actions of the uncle and the woman are significant, and the family's response is a way to cope with that history. It's their prerogative to choose how they interact, even if it's not the most diplomatic option. The SO's perspective is valid, but it's ultimately the author's choice to make based on their family's values and feelings.\n"
