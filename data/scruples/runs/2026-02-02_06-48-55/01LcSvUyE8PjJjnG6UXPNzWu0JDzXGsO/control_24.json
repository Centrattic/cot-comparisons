(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The context is that the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce, and now he's with another woman. The family doesn't like her due to her attitude and her role in the divorce. They're sending a card and considering not including her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's family is still upset about the cheating, which is a serious issue. They don't like the girlfriend and feel that including her might be insincere or disrespectful to their own feelings. On the other hand, the SO thinks it's better to move on and include her, maybe to be polite or show acceptance of the current relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, sending a Christmas card is a personal choice. The family has their reasons for not liking the girlfriend. They might feel that excluding her is a way to express their disapproval or maintain their own boundaries. However, others might argue that once the uncle has moved on, the family should focus on the present and include his current partner as a sign of respect for his current relationships, even if they disagree with his past actions.\n\nBut the author's family is already not close to the uncle anymore. So maybe excluding the girlfriend isn't about the person herself but the entire history. The author is aligning with their family's decision, which is a personal choice. They might not be in the wrong because it's their prerogative how to address their family. However, there's also the perspective that being inclusive, even in the face of past issues, could be seen as more mature.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the author and their family are choosing not to respect the uncle's decision to be with this woman. The uncle is part of the family, and perhaps the author's stance is more about holding onto past grievances. If the uncle is still part of the family events, maybe excluding the girlfriend could be seen as excluding him indirectly. But since the family isn't as close as before, maybe it's not about excluding but about personal feelings towards the girlfriend.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have their reasons. The SO's argument is about moving on, but the author and family have valid reasons for not including her. The decision to include someone on a card is a personal choice, and the author isn't harming anyone by not including her. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
