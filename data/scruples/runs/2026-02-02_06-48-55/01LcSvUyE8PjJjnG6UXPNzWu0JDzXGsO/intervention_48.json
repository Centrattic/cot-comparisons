(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves family issues where the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. The family doesn't like the new girlfriend, and now they're debating whether to include her in the holiday greeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author and their family are against including the girlfriend because of past cheating and the fact that the family doesn't approve of her. Their parents agree, and the author's SO is conflicted. The SO thinks it might look bad not to include her, but the author sides with the family. \n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and boundaries. The author's family still has a strained relationship with the uncle because of the cheating. They might feel that including the girlfriend is a sign of acceptance, which they're not ready to give. On the other hand, the SO's argument is about moving on and focusing on the present, which is a valid point too. \n\nBut here's the thing: sending a Christmas card is a gesture of goodwill, even if the relationship is complicated. The author might be avoiding a person who is now part of their uncle's life. However, the family's feelings are valid, especially if they haven't reconciled with the uncle. The uncle's girlfriend might not be the one who cheated, though she is associated with the aftermath of that situation. \n\nBut does excluding her mean the author is in the wrong? Well, the card is addressed to the uncle, not to the girlfriend. If the uncle is still part of their family events (as mentioned he is), then not including his current partner might seem cold. However, if the family's stance is that they don't approve of the relationship, then their choice is a personal one. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. There's no clear right or wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the card is going to the uncle, maybe including the girlfriend isn't necessary unless the author is addressing her directly. However, if the uncle is present in family gatherings with her, the author's family might be showing disapproval by excluding her in the card. That could be seen as harsh, especially if the uncle is trying to move forward. \n\nBut again, the family's feelings are hurt because of the cheating. They have the right to maintain boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for upholding those boundaries. However, if the family still interacts with the uncle, excluding his current partner might send a mixed message. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their decision is based on past hurt. However, it's important to consider that not including someone who is now part of their uncle's life could be seen as ignoring the present. But the author's reasoning is tied to past actions, which are out of the girlfriend's control. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their decision stems from personal and family boundaries and past trauma, which are valid reasons. However, there's a case for being inclusive, but the question is about being in the wrong, and the author isn't necessarily wrong for respecting their family's feelings.\n"
