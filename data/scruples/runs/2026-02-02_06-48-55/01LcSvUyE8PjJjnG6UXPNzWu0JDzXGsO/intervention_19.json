(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation is that the uncle cheated on his ex-wife, leading to a divorce, and now he's with a new girlfriend. The family doesn't like the girlfriend for various reasons and wants to exclude her from the card.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics here. The uncle is still part of the family, even though there's tension. The author's parents and family think they shouldn't include the girlfriend, possibly due to past hurt. The author's SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad to exclude her now. The author is sticking with the family's decision.\n\nOn one hand, excluding someone from a Christmas card might seem like a small gesture, but it can carry emotional weight. The girlfriend is part of the uncle's current life, and not including her could send a message of disapproval. However, the family has valid reasons based on past actions (cheating) and the girlfriend's behavior. The family's feelings are real, and they might not be ready to accept her yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's SO's perspective is about moving on and focusing on the present. If the uncle is trying to rebuild his life, including his partner in correspondence might be a way to acknowledge his current situation. But the family's discomfort stems from a place of hurt, which is understandable.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the family's right to feel hurt and the potential for the exclusion to be seen as a personal attack on the uncle's new relationship. However, the family's decision isn't malicious; it's about their unresolved feelings. The author isn't being disrespectful to the girlfriend per se but is choosing to honor the family's stance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. If the exclusion is based on genuine hurt and not on the girlfriend's actions (like if the family didn't like her for other reasons), but here the main issue is the uncle's cheating and the family's ongoing discomfort. The author isn't obligated to include someone in a personal card if the family feels it's not the right thing. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
