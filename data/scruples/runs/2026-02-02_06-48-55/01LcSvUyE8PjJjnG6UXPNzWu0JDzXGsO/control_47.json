He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated on his ex-wife, the aunt. They're divorced now, and the uncle is currently with a new girlfriend. The family doesn't really like this girlfriend for various reasons, like her attitude and the fact that she was involved in the divorce. They still see the uncle, but the relationship isn't the same. Now, the author and their partner are sending Christmas cards and are debating whether to include the girlfriend. The author's parents think not including her is okay, while their partner is conflicted, thinking it might look bad. The author's partner's perspective is different because they haven't dealt with a cheating situation, whereas the author's family has more emotional baggage here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not including the girlfriend. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, the family's reasons for not including her seem rooted in past hurt and disapproval of the uncle's actions. Cheating is a serious issue, and it's understandable that the family might still be upset. However, the uncle is now in a new relationship, and the family is choosing not to acknowledge his current partner. Is that fair? On one hand, the family's feelings are valid; they have a right to be upset about the cheating. On the other hand, excluding the girlfriend from a Christmas card could be seen as punishing her for her partner's past mistakes. She's part of his current life, and if the family is still in contact with the uncle, maybe they should try to be gracious.\n\nThe partner argues that it's time to move on and accept the new relationship. The author's side says they disagree because they don't respect the uncle's decision. But is it the author's place to dictate who the uncle dates now? The uncle is an adult, and his choice of partner is his own. The family might not like her, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should exclude her from greetings. However, if the girlfriend was involved in the cheating or contributed to the divorce in a harmful way, that's different. The scenario says the girlfriend was the one the uncle cheated with, but it's not clear if the girlfriend was aware or participated. Also, the family's reasons include her attitude and that she was between the uncle and aunt\u2014maybe implying she's a problematic person.\n\nSo, the family's decision not to include her is based on both the past infidelity and the girlfriend's current behavior. But Christmas cards are a form of communication with the uncle. If they're not including the girlfriend, is that being disrespectful to the uncle? Maybe the uncle expects his partner to be acknowledged. If they don't include her, the uncle might feel embarrassed or that the family is targeting his partner. Alternatively, if the family doesn't like her, maybe they shouldn't have to pretend to be happy with her. But then again, excluding someone from a greeting can be hurtful, even if they're not a favorite person.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's family is within their rights to hold past actions against the uncle and his partner. The author isn't wrong for having their feelings, but is it wrong to act on them? It's a personal choice, but maybe the partner is right in saying that moving forward is better. However, the author is standing by their family's stance. The answer depends on whether the decision to exclude the girlfriend is justified by the uncle's past actions. Since the uncle cheated, the family is justified in being upset, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
