(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The situation involves past family drama: the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce, and now he's with another woman that the family doesn't like. The family doesn't approve of her and is conflicted about including her in holiday cards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family still interacts with the uncle but isn't close anymore. They have valid reasons for disliking the girlfriend\u2014her role in the divorce and her attitude. The author's parents advised against including her, so the author is following family sentiment. The SO thinks it's better to move on and include her for formality's sake.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the decision to include someone in a Christmas card is a personal choice. The family's feelings are based on past experiences and their current discomfort with the girlfriend. They're not cutting off the uncle entirely but are choosing not to acknowledge his new relationship. That's their right. However, the SO's argument is about letting go of the past and being polite. But the author isn't ignoring the uncle; they're just not recognizing his partner. That's a common situation in family dynamics where some members might still hold grudges or have unresolved issues.\n\nThe key here is whether excluding the girlfriend is an act of disrespect. Since the family already has a strained relationship with the uncle, perhaps they don't want to extend their interactions to his partner. It's not about being right or wrong but about personal boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're respecting their family's wishes and not engaging with someone they don't approve of. On the other hand, some might argue that including her as a formality is more respectful to the uncle. But given the context, the author's choice seems reasonable based on their family's stance. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
