(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The situation involves their uncle cheating on their aunt, leading to a divorce, and the uncle now being in a relationship with someone the family doesn't like.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author and their family disapprove of the uncle's actions and his new partner. They've been advised by their parents to not include the girlfriend, but the author's SO thinks it's better to let bygones be bygones. The key here is whether it's wrong to exclude the girlfriend based on past issues.\n\nI should think about the reasons for exclusion. The family's dislike stems from the cheating and the girlfriend's role in causing the divorce. They don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her now. On the other hand, the SO wants to focus on current relationships and not dwell on past mistakes.\n\nIs it fair to hold the past against someone in a family context? Christmas cards are about maintaining relationships, but if the family is already estranged or strained, maybe excluding someone could add to the tension. However, if the family is uncomfortable, is it their responsibility to include someone they don't like? There's also the aspect of respecting the author's uncle's current partner, regardless of past actions.\n\nBut the author is not the one in the relationship with the uncle; they're part of the family. If their parents are on board with not including her, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Yet, the SO's perspective is about moving forward. Does the author have the right to impose their family's disapproval on their partner's relationship with the uncle?\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their stance is based on their family's feelings. However, there's a valid argument that excluding someone might be seen as holding a grudge. But since the family is already on board, and the author's choice is in line with family values, maybe it's not their fault. Alternatively, it could be seen as being judgmental. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B because the author is aligning with their family's wishes, even though there's a counterpoint about inclusion.\n"
