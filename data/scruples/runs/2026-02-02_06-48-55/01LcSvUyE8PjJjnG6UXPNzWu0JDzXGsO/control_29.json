(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves an uncle who cheated and is now with another woman, which the family doesn't like.\n\nFirst, the uncle's past actions\u2014cheating leading to divorce. Family is still in contact but it's strained. They don't like the new girlfriend because of her attitude and her role in breaking up the marriage. The author, along with their parents, decides not to include the girlfriend in the Christmas card. The SO suggests it might look bad, but the author stands by the family's decision.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. It's a matter of perspective. On one hand, family dynamics can be complex. The uncle's actions caused pain, and the family's dislike for the girlfriend is justified by their history. Choosing not to include her might be a way to express disapproval without being hostile. On the other hand, some might argue that moving forward and accepting the uncle's current partner is more compassionate, especially if the uncle is trying to build a new life.\n\nBut the key points are the family's reasons: they don't like her attitude and her role in the divorce. They are still in contact but the relationship is strained. The Christmas card is a small gesture, and excluding the girlfriend could be seen as a personal choice respecting their feelings. The author isn't cutting ties but making a decision based on their family's stance. The SO's argument is about moving on, but the author's perspective is valid given their history.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice aligned with their family's values and feelings towards the situation.\n"
