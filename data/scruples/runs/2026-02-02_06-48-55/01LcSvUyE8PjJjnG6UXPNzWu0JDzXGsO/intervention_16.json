(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated on his ex-wife, leading to a divorce. Now he's with a new girlfriend, and the family doesn't like her because of her attitude and the fact that she's involved in the uncle's life post-cheating. The family still sees the uncle but it's not the same. They don't like her and don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her. The author and their partner are sending Christmas cards, and there's a debate about including the girlfriend. The author's parents say not to, while the partner thinks it might look bad not to. The author's partner has a different perspective because their family had divorces but no cheating. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not including her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether I agree. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author and family are not the ones who committed the cheating; the uncle did. The family is upset with him and his new partner. By not including the girlfriend in the Christmas card, are they punishing her for the uncle's actions? Or are they justified in their feelings towards her? The girlfriend's presence is a result of the uncle's decision, but she's a separate person. The family's dislike of her could be based on their own biases or the circumstances of how she came into their lives. However, excluding her from a Christmas card might be seen as holding a grudge against her for something she didn't do, especially if they don't like her personally. On the other hand, the family's feelings are valid given the cheating and the impact on their relationship with the uncle.\n\nBut here's the catch: the Christmas card is addressed to the uncle. If the author is sending it to the uncle, including the girlfriend's name might be a formality if they are married or in a long-term relationship. If they are not married, maybe including her isn't necessary. However, if the uncle is now with her and they attend family gatherings together, it's possible that including her is a way of acknowledging their current relationship. The author's partner is concerned about it looking bad not to include her, suggesting that it could be seen as a slight against the uncle if they exclude someone who is part of his life now.\n\nBut the author and family don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her. Is it their place to dictate who he should be with? The author is choosing to exclude the girlfriend based on their disapproval of the uncle's past and current relationship. However, the girlfriend is a separate individual. The author might be conflating their feelings about the uncle's cheating with disliking the girlfriend. The ethical question here is whether it's fair to exclude someone from a greeting card because of their partner's past actions. If the family doesn't like the girlfriend, that's their personal opinion, but excluding her from a card might be more about holding a grudge against the uncle than the girlfriend herself.\n\nOn the other hand, if the family has valid reasons for disliking the girlfriend's attitude and behavior, maybe they have grounds to not include her. But the problem is that the card is intended for the uncle. The author is making a decision about including someone else (the girlfriend) based on their feelings towards the uncle. This could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend is not responsible for the uncle's cheating. The author might be indirectly punishing the girlfriend for the uncle's actions.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is excluding the girlfriend from a Christmas card sent to the uncle because of the uncle's cheating and the family's dislike of the girlfriend. The author's partner is conflicted, thinking it might be better to include her. The author's parents support the exclusion. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for this decision.\n\nConsidering that the girlfriend is a separate person, and the card is for the uncle, the author might not be in the wrong if the exclusion is based on their personal feelings. However, if the exclusion is seen as a way to punish the uncle by excluding someone who isn't at fault, then the author could be in the wrong. It's a delicate balance between personal feelings and respecting others' relationships. The author might be justified in their feelings but could be harming the relationship with the uncle by excluding his partner in a gesture of goodwill like a Christmas card. The partner's concern that it looks bad not to include her is valid because it might come off as a slight against the uncle, which could further strain the relationship.\n"
