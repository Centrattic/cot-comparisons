(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. \n\nFirst, the situation: The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with another woman, and the family doesn't like her. They don't want to include her in the holiday cards. The author's parents agree, but their SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad to exclude her.\n\nSo, the author is aligning with their family's decision. The main question is about whether they're an asshole for doing so. \n\nOn one hand, the family has a history of being hurt by the uncle's actions. They might feel that including the girlfriend would be endorsing his cheating or the new relationship. Their feelings are valid because they were affected by the past events. Also, the girlfriend's attitude and role in the divorce might contribute to the family's dislike.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO argues for moving on and being inclusive. They might see it as a way to show forgiveness and focus on the present. The SO's perspective could be that excluding her might upset the uncle or come off as judgmental.\n\nBut the key here is respect for the family's wishes. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical beyond their personal opinion. They're choosing to follow their family's lead, which is their right. The uncle's relationship is his choice, and while the family might disapprove, it's not their place to judge others. However, the author is within their rights to decide how they interact with their own family, including who to include in correspondence. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're respecting their family's feelings and choices. They aren't directly harming anyone by excluding the girlfriend from the card. The SO's concern about how it looks might be about maintaining family relationships, but the author's family already has a strained relationship with the uncle. Including the girlfriend might not improve things if the family still doesn't respect the uncle's decision.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). They're making a personal choice based on their family's history and feelings, which is their right.\n"
