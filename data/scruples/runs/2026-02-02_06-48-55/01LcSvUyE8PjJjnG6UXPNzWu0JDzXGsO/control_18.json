(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating on his ex-wife, leading to a divorce, and now the family doesn't like his new girlfriend. The author and their family chose not to include the girlfriend in the card, but the SO is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The uncle cheated, which is a major issue. The family is still hurt and doesn't respect the uncle's decision to be with this woman. The author's parents agree with not including her, but the SO thinks it might look bad. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sticking with their family's decision.\n\nCheating is a serious betrayal, and it's understandable that the family would have lingering negative feelings. They might feel that the girlfriend played a role in the divorce, even if she wasn't the one who cheated. However, the uncle is now in a new relationship, and the family's exclusion could be seen as holding a grudge against both him and the girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and family are within their rights to express their feelings by excluding the girlfriend, especially if they don't respect her. But including her might be a way to acknowledge the current relationship and move forward. The SO's perspective is about letting go of the past, which is a valid approach, but the author's stance is rooted in their emotional response to the cheating incident.\n\nIt's important to weigh the hurt caused by the cheating against the potential hurt of exclusion. If the family has moved on and maintains contact with the uncle despite their disapproval, maybe a Christmas card is a small gesture that could foster better relations. However, if including the girlfriend would make the author and family uncomfortable, they aren't obligated to do it. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing their family's perspective, especially considering the emotional history. But there's also a case for moving forward and showing basic courtesy, even if the family doesn't approve of the relationship. The answer might depend on cultural norms, family dynamics, and personal values. Since the author is aligning with their family's decision and the SO is conflicted, it's a personal choice based on their values and what's more important to them.\n"
