(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now the family doesn't like the girlfriend, citing her attitude and the fact that she came between the uncle and aunt. The family still sees the uncle but things are different. The author's parent and they agree not to include the girlfriend in the card, but the SO thinks it might look bad. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for this decision.\n\nHmm. From one angle, the family has a valid reason to be hurt by the uncle's actions. The girlfriend was involved in the cheating, so maybe the family's resentment is directed at her. But Christmas cards are a form of acknowledgment. If they don't include her, does that mean they're punishing her for their uncle's actions? Or is it the family's right to not acknowledge someone they don't respect?\n\nOn the other hand, the SO's perspective is about moving on and focusing on the present. Maybe the uncle and girlfriend are now part of the uncle's life, and excluding her could be seen as holding a grudge. But the family isn't against the uncle; they just don't like his choice of partner. The author's family might feel that including the girlfriend endorses their current relationship, which they disagree with.\n\nBut is excluding someone from a Christmas card a form of punishment? It's a small gesture, but maybe it's hurtful. However, if the family genuinely can't respect the relationship, maybe they have the right to not participate in including her. The question is about the author's responsibility here. Are they being petty, or are they respecting their family's feelings?\n\nThe author isn't the one who cheated; they're reacting to their uncle's actions. Their family's decision to exclude the girlfriend might be based on personal feelings. The SO's argument is about letting go of the past, but the author and family are still affected by it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're honoring their family's stance. But if the SO's perspective is about being inclusive despite past issues, that's a different angle.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether excluding the girlfriend was a personal choice or a family one. If the author is following their family's lead, maybe it's not their fault. But if they're choosing to exclude her out of personal dislike, maybe they're in the wrong. The scenario says the family isn't a big fan, so it's more about family dynamics. In that case, the author might not be at fault. So answer B, no.\n"
