(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated on his wife, leading to a divorce. Now he's with a new girlfriend, who the family doesn't like. The family still sees the uncle but things aren't the same. The author's family, including parents, advises not to include the girlfriend in the Christmas card. The author's significant other is conflicted, thinking it might look bad not to include her, but the author and family are against it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFactors to consider: The uncle's past cheating is a significant issue. The family's dislike for the girlfriend is due to her role in the divorce and her attitude. They don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her. The author is following their family's advice, which suggests they are not acting out of malice but based on their family's stance. The SO's perspective is to move on and include her, but the author's position is more about respecting their family's feelings.\n\nIs it wrong to exclude someone from a Christmas card? Christmas cards are a personal choice, and it's common to include people you want to acknowledge. If the family doesn't like the girlfriend, it's their right to exclude her. However, some might argue that excluding her could be seen as holding a grudge or being disrespectful to the uncle. But if the uncle is the one who cheated and the family is still hurt, maybe they have valid reasons for their stance.\n\nThe author isn't the one who cheated; they're just part of the family affected by the uncle's actions. Their decision is based on their family's feelings, not their own. Including the girlfriend might be awkward or hurtful to the family. The SO is suggesting moving on, but the author is prioritizing family values. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't doing anything wrong by following their family's wishes. They're not directly involved in the cheating, and their exclusion is a personal choice to respect family feelings. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
