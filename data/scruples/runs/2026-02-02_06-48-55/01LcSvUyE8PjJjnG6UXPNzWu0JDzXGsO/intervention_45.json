(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether to include the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with this woman, and the family doesn't like her. The author and their family decide not to include her, but the SO is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle cheated, which is a big deal. The family is still upset about it and doesn't like the girlfriend. They don't respect the uncle anymore. Now, the question is about respecting the current relationship of the uncle by including his girlfriend in the Christmas card.\n\nThe author's argument is that they don't want to acknowledge the relationship because of the past. The SO thinks it's better to move on. The parents also agree with the author. So the family's stance is to not include her. But is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are valid. They were hurt by the uncle's actions, and the girlfriend is associated with that. Excluding her might be a way to show disapproval. But on the other hand, the uncle is now in a new relationship, and perhaps the family should try to be civil, even if they don't approve.\n\nBut the key here is the Christmas card. It's a personal choice of who to address. If the author and their family don't want to include her, maybe they have the right to do so, especially if they don't have a good relationship with her. However, if they still send a card to the uncle but not his girlfriend, someone might see it as excluding her intentionally, which could be seen as being mean or holding a grudge.\n\nBut considering the depth of the betrayal (cheating) and the fact that the family doesn't respect the uncle anymore, maybe their decision is understandable. They might feel that including the girlfriend would be endorsing a relationship that resulted from the cheating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is being overly harsh, and the SO is right that it's time to move forward. But the family's stance is that they don't respect the uncle's decisions now. It's a complicated situation where personal feelings and family dynamics are involved.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to make choices about their correspondence based on their feelings towards their uncle and his partner. However, it's possible that excluding her could be seen as being petty, but given the context of the uncle's actions, it's a personal choice that others might not agree with, but not necessarily wrong.\n"
