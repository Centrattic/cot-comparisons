(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on a Christmas card. The situation involves an uncle who cheated on his ex-wife, leading to the divorce. Now, he's with a new partner, and the author's family doesn't like her due to her attitude and her role in the divorce. The author and their family have decided not to include her in the Christmas card, but the author's partner is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The family doesn't like the girlfriend because of her involvement in the cheating and her attitude. They still see the uncle but not as they did before. The author's parents agreed not to include her, and the author is following that advice. The partner thinks it might look bad not to include her, suggesting moving on and accepting the current situation.\n\nThe key points here are respect and personal feelings. The author and their family are choosing not to acknowledge the relationship due to past actions. Is that justified? On one hand, the uncle's actions were wrong, and the family might still hold resentment. They might feel that including the girlfriend would endorse the cheating or the new relationship. On the other hand, the uncle is divorced, and the family might still want to maintain some connection, even if they don't approve of his new partner.\n\nIncluding someone in a Christmas card is a social gesture. Omitting someone might be seen as a slight, but in this case, the girlfriend isn't a family member. The author's decision could be based on personal feelings rather than a public judgment. However, by excluding her, are they being unfair or holding a grudge? The partner's perspective is to let bygones be bygones, which is a common view in maintaining family ties.\n\nBut the author's family has reasons for their stance. They've experienced betrayal and might still be processing that. The girlfriend's role in the cheating is a factor. However, the uncle is now in a new relationship, and the family's disapproval might affect their relationship with him. The author's partner is concerned about appearing disrespectful, which is a valid point.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to punish someone for their new relationship? The uncle is part of the family, and the author's family is choosing to have a strained relationship because of his past. Omitting the girlfriend might not directly affect the uncle, but it could send a message of disapproval. If the family is okay with that, maybe it's their choice. However, if the author's family is still in contact with the uncle, excluding the girlfriend might not be the best approach for maintaining a positive relationship moving forward.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on personal and family feelings about past events. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether holding a grudge against the uncle's choice of partner is justified. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their family's stance, but they might be if they expect the uncle to change his behavior or if they're causing unnecessary tension. However, since the family has their reasons, it's their choice. But from a broader perspective, including the girlfriend might be a more gracious choice, even if it's not required.\n"
