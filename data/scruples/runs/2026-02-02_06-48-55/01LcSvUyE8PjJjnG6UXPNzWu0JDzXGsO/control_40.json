(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The situation involves past cheating by the uncle, leading to divorce, and the family's lingering discomfort with the new partner.\n\nFirst, the author and family don't like the girlfriend due to her role in the cheating and her attitude. They decide not to include her, based on their parents' advice. The SO thinks it might be rude not to include her, suggesting moving past the past. \n\nThe key points here are family dynamics and personal feelings. The author's stance is based on personal history and family values. They're not being disrespectful to the uncle directly, just choosing not to acknowledge the partner. The SO's argument is about present relationships, but the author and family have valid reasons rooted in past hurt. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" sending a Christmas card is a personal choice. There's no law or strict social rule requiring including someone in a card. The author isn't harming anyone by excluding the girlfriend; they're prioritizing their own comfort and family feelings. The uncle is still acknowledged, just without his partner. The SO might feel it's more gracious to include, but it's not a matter of right or wrong. The author's decision is a personal one, respecting their family's stance. So, the answer is B.\n"
