(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, leading to a divorce, and the family not liking the new girlfriend. The author's side says they don't want to include her, while the SO thinks it's better to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The uncle cheated, which is a big deal. The family is still upset, which is understandable. They don't like the girlfriend for various reasons. The author and family chose not to include her, but the SO is concerned about how it looks.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, sending a Christmas card is a personal choice. The family has valid reasons for their feelings, given the history. The uncle is still part of their family, but the girlfriend is a new person involved. There's no legal or moral obligation to include her. The author isn't cutting off the uncle entirely\u2014they're still in contact. The issue is about acknowledging the new partner. \n\nThe SO's perspective is about moving on, which is good, but the author and family haven't moved past the cheating. It's their right to have those feelings. The answer might hinge on whether excluding the girlfriend is seen as punishing the uncle. But since the uncle is still included, it's more about not endorsing the relationship. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. It's their choice to make, and they're not being hostile. The answer should be B.\n"
