(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, leading to a divorce, and the family not liking the new girlfriend. The author and their family have discussed it and decided not to include her, while the SO is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The uncle cheated, which is a big deal. The family might still be hurt or upset about that. Including the girlfriend might be seen as acknowledging or accepting the new relationship, which the family isn't comfortable with. On the other hand, not including her could be seen as excluding someone from a family event, possibly causing tension.\n\nThe key points are the family's reasons: they don't like the girlfriend's attitude and her role in the divorce. They also mention that they don't respect the uncle anymore. The SO's perspective is to move on and include her, but the author and family disagree.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, there's no clear right or wrong. It's a family decision based on their feelings and past experiences. The author isn't doing anything illegal or morally wrong by excluding someone. However, there's a consideration of being respectful to the uncle's current partner, even if they have issues with her. \n\nBut the family's stance is about their own feelings and history. They might feel that including the girlfriend would be a betrayal of their values or past experiences. The author's decision aligns with their family's wishes, so it's more about their right to make that choice rather than being in the wrong. The SO's concern about \"looking bad\" is more about social norms, but the author and family prioritize their own comfort.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their family's feelings and history. They aren't obligated to include someone they have issues with, especially given the context of cheating and ongoing family tensions. The decision isn't about being disrespectful to the girlfriend but about respecting their own boundaries and past.\n"
