(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves an uncle who cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's in a relationship with someone the family doesn't like. The author, along with their parents, decides not to include the girlfriend in the card, while their SO thinks it's better to include her to be polite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The family has a history of being hurt by the uncle's actions, which caused the divorce. The girlfriend is associated with this painful past, and the family's dislike is rooted in her role in the cheating and their negative perception of her. The author and their family might feel that acknowledging her in the card would imply approval of the relationship or the cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the SO and possibly the author's perspective is that moving on is important, and excluding her could be seen as holding a grudge. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to include her. \n\nLegally and socially, there's no obligation to include someone in a Christmas card. Family gatherings can be complex, and personal feelings play a big role. The author's decision is based on their family's feelings and the history involved. The SO's argument is about moving past the past, but the author and family might not be ready. \n\nIt's important to note that while including the girlfriend might be seen as courteous, it's also a personal choice. If the author and family are uncomfortable, it's their right to decide how to address the card. However, there's a social expectation to be inclusive, especially if the relationship is ongoing and the family still interacts with the uncle. \n\nBut given the specific circumstances\u2014cheating, ongoing negative feelings towards the girlfriend\u2014it's more about personal and family boundaries. The author isn't obligated to show approval of the relationship. The key here is that the decision isn't malicious; it's based on past hurt and current discomfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're respecting their family's feelings and the painful history, and it's their choice how to send their holiday greetings.\n"
