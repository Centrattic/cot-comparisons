(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether to include the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce, and now he's with this new girlfriend. The family doesn't like her because of her attitude and her role in the cheating. The author's partner thinks they should include her, but the author and parents say no. The question is if the author is an asshole for not including her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle's infidelity caused a divorce, which is a serious issue. The family is still hurt and doesn't respect the uncle's decision to be with this woman. They don't like her and feel she's a negative influence. The author is following the family's wishes here. On the other hand, the partner argues that they should move on and include her now. \n\nBut why is the author's decision being questioned? Well, maybe because sending a Christmas card is a gesture of goodwill, and excluding someone could be seen as cutting them off. But the key points here are the reasons for exclusion: cheating, the family's lingering hurt, and disapproval of the new relationship. \n\nIs it wrong to not include someone based on past actions? Well, the author isn't excluding the uncle himself\u2014they're still sending a card to him. The exclusion is of the girlfriend. The uncle is part of the family, and the family is choosing to not acknowledge his new partner. That might be a personal choice, especially if the family has valid reasons for their discomfort. \n\nBut does that make the author an asshole? It depends on the perspective. If the author is supporting their family's stance and the uncle is aware and okay with it, maybe not. However, if the uncle expects the girlfriend to be included because she's part of his current life, there might be tension. But the author isn't being cruel; they're respecting their family's feelings and past hurt. \n\nThe partner's view is that moving on is important, but the author and family aren't ready. Is that fair? It's a judgment call. If the family is choosing to not respect the uncle's current situation, maybe that's harsh. But given the cheating and the reasons for disliking the girlfriend, the author's position is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in alignment with their family's values and emotions. Excluding someone from a Christmas card isn't a public shaming; it's a private decision. Unless there's a direct harm intended, the author isn't being an asshole. The answer is B.\n"
