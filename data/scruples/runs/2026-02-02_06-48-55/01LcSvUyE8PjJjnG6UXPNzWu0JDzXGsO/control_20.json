(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The uncle cheated on his ex-wife, leading to a divorce. Now he's with a new girlfriend, and the family doesn't like her. The author's family and SO are divided. The author and their parents think not including the girlfriend is okay, while the SO thinks it might look bad. The question is whether the author is an asshole for not including her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and family dynamics. The uncle's actions caused the family to have a strained relationship. The girlfriend is part of the uncle's new life, but the family doesn't like her. The decision to exclude her from the Christmas card is a personal choice, but does that make them wrong?\n\nI should consider cultural norms around holidays. Christmas cards are usually a way to acknowledge relationships. However, the family might be maintaining a boundary due to past hurt. The uncle's infidelity was part of his life, and the family's feelings about him might influence their view of the girlfriend. They might not want to condone the relationship or the cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO argues that moving on and accepting the current situation is important. But the family's reasons for disliking the girlfriend are mentioned, like her attitude and being the cause of the divorce. So, it's not just about the uncle's past, but also how the girlfriend is perceived.\n\nThe author isn't in a position to dictate who their uncle dates, but the family's decision to exclude the girlfriend is about their own feelings. It's a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. They're not being disrespectful to the uncle by excluding her; they're not acknowledging their relationship in their holiday greetings. That's a matter of personal preference and how they want to handle their family dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their family's feelings and past experiences. It's their right to decide who to include in their holiday cards, especially if it's a source of tension for them.\n"
