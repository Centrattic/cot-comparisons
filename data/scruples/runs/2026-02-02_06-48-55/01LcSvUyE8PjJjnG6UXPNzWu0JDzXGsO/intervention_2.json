(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on a Christmas card. The situation involves a family that's still processing an uncle's past cheating, which led to a divorce. The family doesn't like the girlfriend and wants to exclude her, while the SO thinks they should include her to be polite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The uncle cheated, and the family is still hurt. They might feel that the girlfriend was part of the problem. Including her on the card could be seen as acknowledging a relationship that caused pain. But on the other hand, the uncle has moved on and is now in a new relationship, and the family is still in contact with him. The SO's argument is about moving past the past and focusing on the current situation.\n\nThe author's parents agree with excluding her, so there's family support. The author's SO is conflicted, which adds tension. The key points are respect, forgiveness, and boundaries. The author might feel that including the girlfriend would be a sign of acceptance of the uncle's actions, which the family is not comfortable with yet. However, the SO's perspective is about letting go and being inclusive now.\n\nIs the author wrong for upholding their family's stance? Well, family dynamics are complex. If the family still holds resentment, it's understandable they want to set boundaries. But if the uncle is now part of their life again, excluding his partner might send a mixed message. However, the family's feelings are valid, and they have the right to decide how they want to interact. The author isn't wrong for protecting their family's feelings. The SO's suggestion isn't necessarily right either; it's a matter of personal and family values. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
