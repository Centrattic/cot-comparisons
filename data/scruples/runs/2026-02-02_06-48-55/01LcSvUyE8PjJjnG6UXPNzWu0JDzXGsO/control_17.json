(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The situation involves past cheating by the uncle, which led to divorce, and the family's ongoing discomfort with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and personal boundaries. The uncle cheated, which caused the divorce, and the family still has unresolved feelings. The author's parents advised against including the girlfriend, and the author agrees. The spouse wants to include her to move on, but the author and family don't like her for various reasons.\n\nIt's important to note that the family hasn't cut off the uncle entirely; they still see him. However, their feelings towards the girlfriend are negative. Sending a Christmas card is a personal choice, and whether to include someone in the greeting is a matter of personal preference and family values. There's no objective right or wrong here, but societal norms often emphasize being polite and inclusive, even with difficult relationships. However, if the family feels that including the girlfriend would be hypocritical or hurtful given the past, their stance could be justified as maintaining their own boundaries.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily being inconsiderate; they're making a choice based on family consensus and past experiences. The spouse's perspective is valid too, promoting forgiveness and moving forward. But the author and family have their reasons rooted in the uncle's cheating and the girlfriend's role in the family rift.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal feelings and past events can justify not including someone in a card. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting according to their family's values and the circumstances. They're not harming anyone by choosing not to include the girlfriend, especially if it's a personal choice rather than public shaming.\n"
