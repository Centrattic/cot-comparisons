(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated on his wife, leading to their divorce. Now he's with a new girlfriend, and the family doesn't like her. They don't approve of her because of the cheating and her attitude. The author and their family decide not to include her in the Christmas card, even though their partner is conflicted. The parents agree with the author, and the partner thinks it's better to include her now, moving past the past.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. So, what's the main point here? It's about whether it's acceptable to exclude someone from a Christmas card based on past actions of their partner and their own feelings towards the new partner.\n\nOn one hand, the family has a reason to be upset because of the cheating. The uncle's actions caused the divorce, and the new girlfriend was involved in that. The family doesn't like her, so maybe they feel justified in not including her. On the other hand, the partner thinks that they should move on and include her now, as part of the current family dynamics.\n\nBut the Christmas card is a personal choice. It's their card, and they can choose whom to address. The uncle might be upset if his girlfriend isn't included, but the family's decision is based on their feelings towards the situation. The author isn't in a position to force the uncle to reconcile with his ex-wife or accept the new girlfriend. However, by excluding her, are they holding a grudge against the uncle? Or is it about respecting their own feelings?\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might not be responsible for the cheating. The uncle chose to cheat; the girlfriend was the other woman. But the family is blaming her for being involved in the affair. If the girlfriend is now in a committed relationship with the uncle, maybe she's not part of the cheating anymore. But the family's resentment is towards both the uncle and the girlfriend.\n\nThe dilemma is about whether personal feelings and past events justify excluding someone from a holiday card. The author's stance is that they don't want to acknowledge the girlfriend because of her role in the divorce. The partner's argument is about moving on. But the author and family are acting on their own feelings, not necessarily being inconsiderate unless they are actively harming others. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, Christmas cards are a personal choice. There's no rule that you must include everyone. The author isn't being disrespectful towards the uncle by not including the girlfriend. They might be showing that they don't support the relationship, which is their right. However, if the uncle expects them to include her, then maybe there's a hurtful aspect. But the story says they still see the uncle, just not the same. So maybe the relationship is strained, but they're maintaining contact without being overly close.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a choice based on their family's feelings and the past situation. It's about personal boundaries and respecting their own and their family's emotions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
