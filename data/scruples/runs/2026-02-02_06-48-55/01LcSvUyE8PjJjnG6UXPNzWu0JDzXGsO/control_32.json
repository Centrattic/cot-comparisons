(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves past cheating by the uncle, leading to a divorce, and the family's ongoing dislike for the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The uncle cheated, which is a serious betrayal. The family is still hurt, and they don't like the girlfriend for various reasons. The author's family and they themselves think it's okay not to include the girlfriend, while the spouse thinks it should be done to be polite.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, excluding someone from a Christmas card can be seen as a personal choice, especially if the family has unresolved issues. But there's also the idea of moving on and being inclusive. However, the uncle is still part of the family, and the girlfriend is now part of his life. The author's family might feel justified in their stance because of the uncle's past actions and the girlfriend's role in them. On the other hand, the spouse's perspective is about letting go of the past and focusing on current relationships. \n\nBut the key points here are that the uncle is divorced, and the family is still in contact with him. The dislike for the girlfriend stems from her involvement in the cheating and her current attitude. The author's decision not to include her might be based on their own negative feelings, but does that make them wrong? \n\nI think it's a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have their reasons rooted in past events. However, there's a social expectation to be polite. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about social norms. Since the author isn't hurting anyone physically and is making a personal decision based on their family's feelings, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
