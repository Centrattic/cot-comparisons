(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The situation involves their uncle cheating on their aunt, leading to a divorce. Now the uncle is with this new partner, who the family doesn't like for various reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The uncle's infidelity caused the divorce, which is a significant betrayal. The family still sees the uncle but relations are strained. The uncle brings his new girlfriend to family events, but the family isn't fond of her. They don't like her attitude and the fact that she was involved in the breakup.\n\nThe core issue is whether excluding the girlfriend from the Christmas card is acceptable. The author's parents advise against including her, while their SO thinks it might look bad. The author's stance is influenced by their family's disapproval of the uncle's actions and his new partner.\n\nI should think about cultural norms around holiday cards. Typically, Christmas cards are a way to acknowledge family and friends, but if someone's presence is a point of contention, it's a personal choice. The author's family has their reasons, so it's not necessarily wrong to exclude her, especially if including her would make the family uncomfortable or imply support for the relationship.\n\nHowever, the SO's point about moving past the past is valid. But the author's family's feelings are also important. They have the right to make their own decisions based on their values and experiences. Cheating is a serious issue, and the family might not want to legitimize the new relationship by including her. It's a personal choice, and there's no right or wrong answer, but the author isn't in the wrong for respecting their family's wishes.\n"
