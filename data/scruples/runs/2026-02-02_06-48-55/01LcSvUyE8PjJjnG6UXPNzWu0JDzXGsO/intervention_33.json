(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's new girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves family drama where the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with another woman, and the family doesn't like her for various reasons.\n\nFirst, the author and their family have a history of conflict with the uncle, mainly due to the cheating. They still see him but not as before. The family, including the parents, advises against including the girlfriend. The author's SO is conflicted, thinking it might be better to include her for politeness. The author's reasoning is based on past actions and current feelings towards the uncle and his new partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respect, family dynamics, and whether excluding someone from a holiday card is justified. The author's family has valid reasons rooted in past hurt. However, the uncle is now with someone else, and the author is choosing to exclude the new partner, which might affect the uncle's feelings. The SO's argument is about moving forward and being polite now, regardless of past issues.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, excluding someone from a holiday card can be seen as a personal choice. If the family doesn't have a relationship with the girlfriend, they aren't obligated to include her. The main issue is whether the exclusion is a personal choice or a judgment on the uncle's decisions. Since the author and family are not close with the uncle anymore and have their own reasons for not liking the girlfriend, it's their prerogative. The uncle might feel excluded, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for making that choice. The answer here is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their family's feelings and past experiences.\n"
