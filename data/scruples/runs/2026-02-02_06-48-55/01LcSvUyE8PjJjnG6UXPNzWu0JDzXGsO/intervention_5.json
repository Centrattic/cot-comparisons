(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on a Christmas card. The main issue seems to be about whether excluding the girlfriend is justified given the past and ongoing family tensions.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. The family is still upset, and they don't like the girlfriend. They see her as part of the problem, maybe because she's the third party. Now, the author and their family are deciding whether to include her in the Christmas card. The author's partner is conflicted, thinking it might look bad not to include her, but the author and family are against it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the family's feelings about the uncle's actions and the girlfriend, and the social implications of including or excluding her. The author's side is maintaining a stance against the relationship, while the partner suggests moving past the past. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the uncle is in a new relationship. The family still has unresolved feelings. Excluding the girlfriend might be a way to express disapproval, but Christmas cards are typically a friendly gesture. However, the family's feelings are valid. They don't like her, so including her might feel insincere. On the other hand, not including her might be seen as unkind, especially if they still interact with the uncle. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is following their family's advice. The uncle's actions were wrong (cheating), and the girlfriend was the third party. The family's disapproval is understandable. The author isn't being cruel, just not acknowledging the girlfriend. However, if the uncle is now in a new relationship, maybe the family should focus on their relationship with him rather than his partner. Excluding the girlfriend might be a personal choice, but is it wrong? It's a social norm to include people in such cards if they're part of the immediate family or close to the person. But if the family doesn't want to recognize the relationship, that's their choice. The line here is between personal grievance and social expectations. Since the family still sees the uncle as part of their life but disapproves of his new partner, their choice to not include her might be their way of showing that disapproval. The author isn't being malicious; they're just aligning with their family's wishes. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The decision is a personal one based on past hurt, and it's not about being an asshole but about boundaries.\n"
