(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on their Christmas card. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. The family is still upset, and they don't like his new girlfriend. The author and their family are considering not including her in a Christmas card. The SO thinks it might look bad, but the author sides with the family.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the family's feelings towards the girlfriend and the uncle's past actions. Cheating is a serious issue, and the family's discomfort might be justified. They still see the uncle but the relationship isn't the same. The uncle is now with this woman, but the family doesn't respect his decision. \n\nIncluding the girlfriend in the card could be seen as acknowledging their relationship. But the family is still hurt and doesn't like her. On the other hand, excluding her might be perceived as being rude or holding a grudge. The SO argues for moving on, which is a common perspective, but the author's family is more emotionally invested in the past.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the family's reasons are valid (cheating, discomfort with the new partner), then their decision might be justified. However, if the exclusion is based on personal dislike without considering the uncle's current relationship, maybe they are being unfair. It's a balance between respecting family feelings and maintaining politeness.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the family has valid reasons rooted in the uncle's past actions and their continued discomfort. The author is aligning with their family's values, which is understandable. But I also see the other side where holding a grudge could be an issue. However, given the context of cheating and the family's stance, B seems right.\n"
