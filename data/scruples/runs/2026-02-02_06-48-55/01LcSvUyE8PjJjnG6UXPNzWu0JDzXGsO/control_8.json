(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. The uncle cheated, the family is still upset, and they don't like the girlfriend. The author's partner wants to include her, but the author and family think not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle's infidelity led to the divorce. The family is still not on good terms, and they don't like the girlfriend. The Christmas card is a personal choice, so maybe they have the right to decide who to include. But the partner argues it might look bad. \n\nIs the author's stance acceptable? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The author isn't ignoring the uncle entirely; they still send a card. The issue is including the girlfriend. The uncle is part of the family, but the girlfriend isn't a family member. The family's dislike is based on past actions and her role in the divorce. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to include someone the family dislikes. However, if the uncle and girlfriend are together now, maybe the author should consider being polite. But the family's feelings are valid too. There's no right or wrong here. The decision is subjective. The author might not be in the wrong because they're respecting their family's wishes and past hurt. The answer is B.\n"
