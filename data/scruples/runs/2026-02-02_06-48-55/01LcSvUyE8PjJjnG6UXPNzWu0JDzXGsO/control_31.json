(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The uncle cheated on his wife, leading to a divorce. The family still sees the uncle but it's not the same. Now he's with another woman, and the family doesn't like her because of her attitude and her role in the divorce. The author and family think not including her in the Christmas card is okay, while their SO and maybe others think it's better to move on and include her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the uncle's past cheating, the family's negative feelings towards his current girlfriend, and the debate about whether to include her in a holiday card. The author is seeking validation on if they're being unreasonable.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around sending holiday cards. Typically, people include people they're close to or want to acknowledge. However, if the family doesn't like the girlfriend, maybe they don't want to legitimize the relationship. On the other hand, excluding someone might be seen as cutting them off, especially if the uncle is included.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the family isn't fans of the girlfriend and respects the uncle but isn't supportive. The SO's argument is about moving past the past. The author's position is more about not condoning the relationship or the past actions.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's their choice. They aren't obligated to include anyone they don't want to. However, if the uncle is part of the family, maybe excluding his partner could be seen as excluding him indirectly. But the family already has a strained relationship with the uncle due to the cheating. The girlfriend is part of that situation. The author isn't being disrespectful to the uncle necessarily, but they don't want to acknowledge the girlfriend. It's a personal choice, and unless there's a social expectation to include her, maybe it's not the author's fault.\n\nBut maybe there's a different angle. If the author is sending a card to the uncle, and the girlfriend is his current partner, even if the family is unhappy, not including her might make the uncle feel left out. But the author's family might not be close enough to include her. Alternatively, the author could send a separate card to the uncle without the girlfriend. But the question is about the Christmas card list. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal values. The author is not in the wrong because they are respecting their family's feelings. The SO's concern is about being polite, but the author's stance is about their own comfort and family's values. So, probably answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
