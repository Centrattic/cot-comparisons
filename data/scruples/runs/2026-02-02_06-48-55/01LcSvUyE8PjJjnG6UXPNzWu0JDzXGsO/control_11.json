(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves the uncle cheating, leading to divorce, and now the family doesn't like his new girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle cheated, which is a serious issue. The family is still hurt and doesn't like the girlfriend because of her role in the divorce. The author's parents advised not to include her, and the author agrees. The SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad not to include her.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is an asshole. The key points here are the family's feelings and the reasons for excluding the girlfriend. Cheating is a major betrayal, and the family is still processing that. The author isn't being disrespectful to their uncle, just not recognizing the new relationship. The SO's perspective is more about moving on, but the author's stance is rooted in their family's experience.\n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't cutting off their uncle but is choosing not to include the girlfriend. The reasons given are valid\u2014family discomfort and the girlfriend's role in the divorce. Including her could be seen as acknowledging a relationship that caused pain. So, the author isn't in the wrong for respecting their family's wishes and their own feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
