(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the uncle cheated a few years ago, leading to a divorce. Now he's with this woman, and the family doesn't like her. They don't like her attitude and are upset she came between the uncle and aunt. The author and their family decided not to include her in the Christmas card, consulting parents and agreeing. The SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad not to include her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole for this decision. So, the key points here are the family's feelings versus the SO's perspective of moving on. The uncle's actions caused the divorce, and the family is still upset. The author is standing by their family's decision, which is to not acknowledge the new relationship.\n\nNow, considering social norms, Christmas cards are a way to include people in the holiday greetings. If you're sending a card to someone, it's customary to include their current partner unless there's a reason not to. However, in this case, the family has a history of disapproval. The author's parents and family support not including her, so it's a family decision, not just the author's personal choice.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the uncle is part of the family, but the family's feelings towards him and his new partner are negative. They don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her. The author is choosing to align with their family's stance, which might be seen as justified given the past. On the other hand, the SO thinks that moving past the past and acknowledging current relationships is important.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's about respect and boundaries. If the family still holds a grudge and doesn't respect the uncle's current partner, they have the right to express that by not including her. However, some might argue that it's unkind to exclude someone in a committed relationship, especially in a family card. But the family's feelings are valid here. They have reasons to be upset, so it's not necessarily wrong to honor those feelings.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are respecting their family's sentiments and past experiences, which is a valid approach.\n"
