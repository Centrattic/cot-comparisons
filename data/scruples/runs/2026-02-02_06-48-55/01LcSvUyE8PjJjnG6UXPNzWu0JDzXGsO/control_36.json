(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to include their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card.\n\nFirst, the context: The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with a new girlfriend. The family doesn't like her for various reasons\u2014her attitude, her role in the divorce, etc. They're sending out Christmas cards and deciding whether to include her. The author's side is against it, the SO is for it. The parents agree with the author.\n\nThe key points here are the family's feelings towards the girlfriend. They don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her, which might be influenced by past hurt. The author is standing by their family's decision. The SO thinks it's better to move on, but the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The question is about respect and inclusion. If the family genuinely doesn't respect the uncle's choice, maybe they are holding onto old resentment. However, there's a valid reason for their feelings\u2014cheating and the girlfriend's role in the family drama.\n\nBut Christmas cards are a form of communication. Excluding someone might be seen as excluding the person from the family's acknowledgment. On the other hand, if the family is still hurt and doesn't want to engage with the person they blame, their stance is understandable. It's about balancing personal feelings with family expectations.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether respecting the uncle's current partner is necessary versus the family's right to express their disapproval. If the family is not being disrespectful in a public way but choosing to exclude someone in a personal communication, maybe it's not the author's fault. They're following family consensus. However, the SO's argument about moving on is also valid. But given the context, the author might not be in the wrong because their stance is based on family reasons and past events. So Answer B (No) would be appropriate here.\n"
