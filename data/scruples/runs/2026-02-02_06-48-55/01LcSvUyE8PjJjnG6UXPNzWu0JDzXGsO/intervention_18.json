(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce, and now the family doesn't like the girlfriend. The family, including the author, decides not to include her in the card, but the SO is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle's infidelity caused a family rift, and the ex-wife's divorce from cheating. The family still sees the uncle but relations aren't the same. The girlfriend is now part of his life, but the family dislikes her for her attitude and her role in the divorce. They don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her. The author's parents agree with excluding her, while the SO thinks including her would be better to move on.\n\nThe author's stance is based on their family's feelings and past issues. The SO, however, suggests letting the past go. The author is in a position where they have to balance family sentiment with their partner's perspective.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, Christmas cards are personal. The author isn't obligated to include anyone they don't want to. The family's decision is a personal choice, not a public shaming. The uncle's new partner is part of his current life, but the family's reasons for disliking her are valid in the context of their history. The author isn't wrong for respecting their family's feelings, especially if they've been hurt before. Including the woman might be a step too soon or could cause resentment. The SO's perspective is more about moving forward, but the author's family hasn't reconciled yet. So the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision that aligns with their family's feelings.\n"
