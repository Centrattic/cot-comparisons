(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card.\n\nFirst, the context: The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with another woman, and the family doesn't like her. They don't like her because of the cheating and her attitude. The author's family advises not including her, but the SO is unsure, thinking it might look bad. The author is on the side of the family, while the SO wants to move on.\n\nSo, the question is whether excluding the girlfriend is wrong. The author's reasoning is based on past actions and family disapproval. The SO's side is about moving forward and including current relationships.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the uncle's cheating was a serious issue, and the family might still be hurt. Including the girlfriend could be seen as endorsing the new relationship, which they don't agree with. Plus, the family's feelings are important here.\n\nOn the other hand, the uncle is part of the family, and maybe excluding his partner could be seen as a way of punishing him. The SO's point is that they should let bygones be bygones. Also, in Christmas cards, it's common to include current partners unless there's a strong reason not to.\n\nBut the author's family has a valid reason: the uncle's cheating and the girlfriend's role in causing family tension. They don't respect the uncle's decision to be with her. So maybe it's reasonable to exclude her. However, is it necessary to take a stance in a Christmas card? Maybe a neutral approach would be better, like sending the card to the uncle without mentioning the girlfriend. That way, they're not endorsing but also not excluding her directly. But the author might feel that including her would imply approval, which they don't want.\n\nThe key points are the family's hurt and the desire to not support the relationship. The SO's side is about moving on, but the author and family see the relationship as part of the problem. The answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified. Since the uncle's actions caused the original hurt, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to include the girlfriend. They're protecting their own family's feelings. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
