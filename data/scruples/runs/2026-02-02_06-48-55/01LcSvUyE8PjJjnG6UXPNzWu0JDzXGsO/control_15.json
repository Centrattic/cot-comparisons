(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend in the Christmas card. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe uncle cheated on his ex-wife, leading to their divorce. He's now with his girlfriend, who the family doesn't like\u2014partly because of her role in the affair and her attitude. The family, including the author and their parents, doesn't want to include her in the Christmas card. The author's SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad, but the author and family are against it.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether excluding the girlfriend is justified. The family's reasons are based on past actions and current feelings. The uncle's actions (cheating) and the girlfriend's role in the family drama are key points. The family's dislike for the girlfriend is clear, and they feel justified in their stance.\n\nNow, considering social norms, Christmas cards are typically sent to family members. Including a partner in the card is a gesture of acceptance. However, the family is distancing themselves from the uncle's choices. They might feel including the girlfriend would condone the cheating or show respect for their relationship, which they don't agree with.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of current relationships. The family still sees the uncle, though things are different. The question is whether it's right to exclude the girlfriend now. The author's SO suggests moving on, but the author's family isn't ready to do so. \n\nFrom a standpoint of respect, the family might be within their right to choose not to include someone they don't respect. However, some might argue that it's best to focus on the present and not let past issues affect current family ties, even if the feelings are strong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the exclusion is justified. Since the family has reasons rooted in the uncle's cheating and the girlfriend's role, they might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, excluding someone who's part of the uncle's current life could be seen as cutting off a connection. However, the family's feelings are valid here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the decision is based on the family's genuine feelings towards the uncle's past and the girlfriend's role. They're choosing to honor their values and past experiences, even if it means a strained relationship. So, answer B.\n"
