(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not including the uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The situation involves family dynamics and past issues. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now he's with another woman, and the family doesn't like her. The author and their family have consulted with their parents and decided not to include her, but the SO is conflicted.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the uncle's past actions and the family's discomfort. The SO's perspective is about moving on and not letting the past affect current relationships. The family's reasons include the woman's attitude and her role in the divorce. \n\nI should consider cultural norms around holiday cards. Typically, holiday cards are a way to include current family members who are part of the present relationships. If the uncle and his new partner are part of his current life, maybe the family should acknowledge them. However, the family's feelings of disapproval and lack of respect might be valid. \n\nBut there's a difference between personal feelings and public acknowledgment. Even if they don't like her, excluding her could be seen as a judgment. The author's SO is concerned about how it looks, suggesting that it might be better to include her to avoid appearing disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the family has a right to their feelings. They might not want to endorse the relationship, especially given the circumstances. However, holiday cards are a public gesture, and excluding someone who is now part of the uncle's life could send a message of disapproval. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author isn't being malicious; they're acting on family's discomfort. But including the girlfriend might be a more considerate gesture, even if they don't personally endorse the relationship. The key is whether excluding her is a form of personal disapproval that's being imposed on the uncle, which might be harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But if the family is still in contact with the uncle, excluding his partner could be seen as a passive-aggressive move. The author's SO's point about moving on and focusing on current relationships might be more socially acceptable. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're letting past issues affect a present gesture that could be more inclusive. Choosing to exclude someone who is part of the uncle's current life might be seen as not fully accepting the current situation, even if the family has their reasons. Hence, the answer might be A (author in the wrong).\n"
