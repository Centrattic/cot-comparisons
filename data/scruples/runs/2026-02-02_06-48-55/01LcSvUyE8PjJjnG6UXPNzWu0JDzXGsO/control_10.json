(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. Now, the uncle is with this new girlfriend, and the family doesn't like her. The author and their family decided not to include her in the Christmas card. The SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad. The parents agree with the author. The question is if the author is an asshole for this decision.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the uncle's cheating is a major issue. The family is still upset, and they don't like the girlfriend for various reasons. On the other hand, the SO argues that they should let bygones be bygones. But the author and parents are against it. \n\nI need to consider if excluding someone from a Christmas card is a big deal. Christmas cards are a way to acknowledge relationships. If the uncle is part of the family, maybe not including his partner could be seen as a slight. However, the family's feelings about the cheating and the girlfriend's role in the divorce might justify their stance. They might feel that including her would show approval of the uncle's actions. \n\nBut then again, the uncle is now in a new relationship, and the family's ongoing judgment could be seen as holding a grudge. The SO's perspective is that they should focus on current relationships, not past issues. However, the author's family's reasons for disliking the girlfriend (attitude, causing the divorce) might be valid. So, it's a balance between respecting family feelings and maintaining current relationships.\n\nI think it's not necessarily wrong. The author and family are respecting their feelings and boundaries. The uncle's actions were wrong, and they might feel justified in not acknowledging the girlfriend. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like sending a card to the uncle without mentioning the girlfriend. But the author is choosing not to include her, which aligns with their family's disapproval. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
