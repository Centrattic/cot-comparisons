(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether to include the uncle's girlfriend in a Christmas card. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce, and now he's with this woman who the family doesn't like. The author and their family decided not to include her, but the SO is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The uncle cheated, which is a big deal. The family is still upset about it, and they don't like the girlfriend for various reasons. The author's parents advised not to include her, which suggests the family's stance is pretty firm. The SO's argument is about moving past the past, but maybe the family hasn't healed enough yet.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for not including the girlfriend. On one hand, excluding someone could be seen as unkind, especially if they're part of the uncle's current life. On the other hand, if the family still has unresolved feelings about the cheating and the girlfriend's role in the divorce, maybe it's understandable they don't want to acknowledge her.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. Christmas cards are personal, and it's the sender's choice who to address. The author isn't obligated to include someone they don't like. However, the uncle is part of the family, so maybe the author should consider his feelings. But the uncle made his choice to be with the girlfriend, and the family's disapproval is their own issue.\n\nAnother angle: if the author includes the girlfriend, it might feel like condoning the uncle's actions. If they exclude her, it could hurt the uncle's feelings. But the author's parents are on board with excluding her, so it's a family decision. The SO's different perspective shows that there's no one-size-fits-all answer here.\n\nI think it's about respect and boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to honor their family's feelings. They have the right to decide who to include in their personal communications. The uncle's actions affected the family, and they're still dealing with the consequences. Including the girlfriend might not be necessary if the family isn't comfortable with her. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
