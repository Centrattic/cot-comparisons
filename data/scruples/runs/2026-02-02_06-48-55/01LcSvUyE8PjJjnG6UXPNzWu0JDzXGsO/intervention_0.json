(They're divorced now it's been a whole thing. We still see my uncle but it's not the same.) He  is now romantically involved with this same woman and brings her to all of our family gatherings etc. My family and I aren't huge fans of her for multiple reasons (attitude, the fact that she got inbetween my uncle and aunt etc...). Basically no one in my family likes her or respects my uncle. \n\nCut to this year.  My SO and I are sending out Christmas cards. As we go through our list my uncle comes up. We debate about whether or not to include her. I consult my parents and they basically say no we shouldn't. My SO is having second thoughts and says it looks bad if we don't.  While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision? Or should we just suck it up and include her on the Christmas card?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for not including their uncle's girlfriend on the Christmas card. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The uncle cheated, leading to a divorce. He's now with a woman who the family doesn't like. They send a Christmas card to the uncle but debate including his current girlfriend. The author and family decide not to include her, consulting their parents. The SO is conflicted, thinking it might look bad not to include her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider different angles. On one hand, excluding the girlfriend might be seen as being judgmental or holding a grudge against the uncle's current relationship. On the other hand, the uncle's cheating caused harm, and the family has valid reasons for not liking the new partner. The decision might be about respecting personal boundaries and past events.\n\nBut Christmas cards are typically about acknowledging current relationships, even if there's a complicated past. If the uncle is now in a committed relationship, not including his partner might send a message of disapproval. However, the family's feelings are also important. They might feel uncomfortable or that including the girlfriend minimizes the past hurt. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe sending a separate card to the girlfriend or addressing it to the uncle alone. But the author's choice is to exclude her. The key issue is whether it's fair to exclude someone from a holiday greeting based on the family's disapproval of their partner. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, some might say that once a relationship is established, you should acknowledge the partner. Others might argue that the family's feelings are valid, especially given the uncle's past actions. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they believe moving on is important. However, the author's stance is supported by their family's reasons. So, there's a balance between holding onto past grievances and accepting the present. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a personal decision based on their family's values and the context of the uncle's actions. They're choosing to honor their family's feelings, which is a valid approach. Therefore, the answer would be B (no).\n"
