HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who has had a difficult teenage life, including bullying. Now successful, they encountered someone from their past (dubbed \"douchebag\") who was a bully. She's now a struggling single mom. When they meet, he brags about his success and says harsh things, feeling good about her suffering. The friends call him an asshole, but he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his actions were wrong. The key points here are the context and the actions. He was bullied by her, which is a serious issue. However, his response when they met again was to boast and mock her current situation. Even if he was drunk, that's not a complete excuse. The question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, he's dealing with past trauma and might have unresolved feelings. On the other hand, confronting someone in a derogatory way, even if they were a bully, is generally considered inconsiderate. The fact that she's a single mom struggling adds another layer\u2014using her current hardships to feel superior is unkind. People can change, and she might have matured, as he noted. His reaction could have been hurtful, even if he felt justified.\n\nThe friends' reaction suggests that his behavior was inappropriate. The author's satisfaction in her suffering might indicate a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. Even if there's a history, it's about how you handle it. Instead of expressing his success in a way that's dismissive or mocking, a more compassionate approach might have been better. So, considering all this, it's likely that the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
