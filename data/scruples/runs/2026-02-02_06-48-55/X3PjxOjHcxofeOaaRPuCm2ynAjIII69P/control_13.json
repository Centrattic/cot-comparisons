HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether to answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a tough high school experience with a girl named Douchebag who bullied him. Then he turned his life around, got a good job, and is doing well. He meets her again, she's struggling as a single mom. He brags about his success, making her feel bad, and says he feels good about her suffering. His friends think he's an asshole, but he's questioning if it's justified.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author met someone from his past who had bullied him. He's now in a better position and uses the encounter to boast. Even though he was drunk, he was aware of her situation. He expressed a lack of sympathy and even took pleasure in her struggles. \n\nThe main ethical issue is whether it's okay to gloat over someone's misfortune, especially if they were previously unkind. The author feels justified because of his past, but does that make it okay? \n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally don't appreciate others gloating about their own successes when someone else is struggling. Even if there was past animosity, the situation has changed. She's a single mom facing challenges, and he's in a position where he could show some empathy. Instead, he chose to be harsh and unkind. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as petty. He's not just moving on; he's actively rubbing his success in her face. The fact that he was drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but he still made the choice to act that way. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on her is important. The woman was already struggling, and his comments made her visibly upset. Even if she was a bully before, she's a different person now, especially as a mother. The author's response doesn't consider her current circumstances beyond his own feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he had a right to feel vindicated. But societal expectations usually encourage forgiveness or at least not capitalizing on others' suffering. The author's admission that he felt good about her suffering is a red flag. It shows a lack of empathy and a desire to see her fail, which is unkind.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong. He crossed a line by gloating and showing no compassion, even if there was a history of bullying. The right thing would have been to acknowledge his success but also express some empathy for her current situation.\n"
