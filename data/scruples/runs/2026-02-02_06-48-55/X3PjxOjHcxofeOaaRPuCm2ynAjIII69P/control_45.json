HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author, who had a tough high school experience with this girl, later succeeds and meets her again. They're both adults now, but the author, while drunk and in a social setting, starts bragging about their success and comments on the other woman's struggles. The friends call them an asshole, but the author feels justified because of past bullying.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are the context of past bullying, the current situation where the author is successful and the other person is struggling, and the act of bragging. The key question is whether the author's actions were wrong despite the context.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been bullied, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune might be considered mean-spirited. The author mentions feeling good that the other person is suffering. That's called schadenfreude, which is generally seen as negative. Even if there's a history of bullying, adults are expected to move past it and not gloat over others' hardships.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk and might have said things they wouldn't when sober. However, being drunk doesn't excuse hurtful behavior. People are responsible for their actions, even when intoxicated, especially in social interactions.\n\nAdditionally, the other woman was a single mother struggling as a waitress. The author's comments about her job and financial situation could be seen as insensitive. Even if she was a bully before, that doesn't justify making her feel worse now. There's a difference between sharing one's success and belittling someone else's situation.\n\nThe friends' reaction suggests that the author's behavior was out of line. While the author claims to have \"needed to get it out of their system,\" that's not a valid excuse for being cruel. The author's justification based on past experiences doesn't negate the hurt caused in the present.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there's context, the author's actions were inappropriate. They crossed a line by taking pleasure in another person's struggles and bragging in a way that upset her. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
