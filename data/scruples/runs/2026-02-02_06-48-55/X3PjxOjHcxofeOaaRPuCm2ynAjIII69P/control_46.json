HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother he used to bully. \n\nFirst, the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl, then he turned his life around. He meets her again later when she's in a worse position. He brags about his success while she's clearly struggling. The key points here are the context of past bullying, the power dynamic, and the act of bragging when she's in a vulnerable position.\n\nEven though there's a history of being bullied, the author's actions in the moment\u2014especially when she's trying to have a conversation and he brings up his wealth and her struggles\u2014seems to cross a line. He acknowledges she's upset but continues anyway, which is problematic. Also, feeling good that she's suffering adds another layer of malice. \n\nThe friends' reaction suggests that they felt he was an asshole. While the author might feel justified due to past experiences, the act of gloating in someone else's face, especially when they're in a tough spot, is generally considered unkind and cruel. So, despite the context, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
