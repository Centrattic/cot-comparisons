HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mom. The author was bullied in high school by this person, then later saw her when they were both adults. The author, feeling successful, decided to confront her and brag about their achievements while she's struggling. The question is if that makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a rough past with this person, who was particularly cruel. Now, the author is in a better place, and the former bully is in a tough spot. The author admitted they felt good that the other person was suffering. The key here is whether the bragging and the hurtful comments were justified, even if there's history.\n\nSo, the author was drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions. But even if they were drunk, intent matters. They said they wanted to \"get it out of their system,\" implying they wanted to express their feelings towards someone who had wronged them in the past. However, the way they did it was by belittling the other person's current situation. \n\nThere's a difference between expressing one's own success and directly rubbing it in someone's face to make them feel bad. The author didn't just share their success; they pointed out the other's struggles with a sense of schadenfreude. That's where the line is crossed. Even if the person was a bully before, the adult response would be to handle it with maturity, not to gloat. \n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which is a social indicator. While friends can sometimes be biased, their reaction suggests that the behavior was unkind. The author might justify it as closure, but causing someone emotional pain, even if they were a past bully, isn't considered acceptable in most social contexts. People do change, and the author's actions might have derailed any growth the former bully has made. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, many ethical frameworks emphasize empathy and kindness even towards former adversaries. The author's actions lacked empathy for the current struggles of the other person. Even if the past was unpleasant, the adult way would be to acknowledge the past but show compassion for the present. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. They took a moment of connection and turned it into a confrontation, which is likely to be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
