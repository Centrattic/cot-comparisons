HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him. \n\nFirst, the context: the author had a tough time in high school being bullied, which he's overcome. Now he's successful and met someone from his past who's struggling. The issue is that he bragged while she was in a vulnerable state.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and the appropriateness of the situation. Even if someone has a history of being mean, when they're in a difficult spot, it's generally expected to be compassionate. Bragging about one's own success in front of someone who's struggling, especially when they were once part of the same social circle, can come off as insensitive. The author was drunk, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. People can still be responsible for their actions when under the influence, though the judgment might be a bit more lenient.\n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, which is a social indicator that his actions were frowned upon. The justification he gives is that he needed to \"get it out his system,\" but that doesn't make it right. Holding onto past grudges might be personal, but expressing them in a way that's hurtful to someone who's already struggling is where the problem lies. \n\nAlso, the emotional response of the woman\u2014being visibly upset and annoyed\u2014shows that his words had a negative impact. The fact that he felt good about her suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. While it's understandable to feel a mix of emotions when reconnecting with someone from a painful past, the way he chose to express it was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A, as the author's actions were not justified and were harmful, regardless of his past.\n"
