HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who bragged to a former bully who's now struggling as a single mom. The author was bullied in the past and now feels successful. They met again, and the author ended up belittling the other person, especially when drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a rough time in high school, was bullied by \"Douchebag,\" and now they've turned their life around. When they meet again, the author is unkind, bringing up the other's struggles and even expressing satisfaction that she's suffering. The author justifies it by saying they needed to \"get it out of their system\" and that their past experiences make it justified.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The main factors here are intent, context, and the impact of their actions. While the author has a history of being bullied, which is valid, their response seems to be fueled by spite and a desire to one-up the other person. Even if they were drunk, the behavior was intentional in the sense that they chose to brag and express disdain. \n\nThe other person, despite being a former bully, is now a struggling single mother. The author's comments are not only insensitive but also take advantage of her current situation. The fact that the author feels good about her suffering is a red flag. It shows a lack of empathy and a desire for schadenfreude. \n\nEven though the author had a hard time in the past, that doesn't justify treating someone else poorly. People can make mistakes, and maybe the former bully wasn't perfect, but that doesn't mean she deserves to be mocked. The author could have chosen to be compassionate or at least neutral, but instead, they took the opportunity to gloat. \n\nThe friends' reaction also suggests that the behavior was out of line. The author might think they were just venting, but the impact on the other person was hurtful. The key here is that the author's actions crossed a line from sharing their success to actively making someone else feel bad. \n\nIn conclusion, even with the context, the author's behavior was inappropriate. They took advantage of their success to belittle someone else, especially someone in a vulnerable position. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
