HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves someone who had a difficult high school experience, was bullied by a girl named \"Douchebag,\" and later encounters her when he's successful. He brags about his achievements to her while she's struggling as a single mother.\n\nFirst, the author's actions seem to stem from past pain. He was bullied and now, seeing the person who tormented him in a worse position, he feels vindicated or even glad she's suffering. That's understandable on an emotional level, but does that justify his behavior?\n\nBragging in this context is problematic. Even if he's not in the same situation as Douchebag, bringing up his success when she's clearly struggling can come off as insensitive. People might argue that everyone's circumstances are different and that his comments were cruel, especially to someone who already has a hard time. The fact that he was drunk doesn't excuse it, as people should be responsible for their actions, even under the influence.\n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, which suggests that his actions were out of line. The key point here is intent and the impact of his words. Even if he felt justified, the emotional effect on Douchebag was negative. The author might have wanted to release his anger or resentment, but doing so in a way that hurts another person isn't acceptable.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he felt good about her suffering, which could indicate a desire for revenge or schadenfreude. While that's a human emotion, acting on it in a hurtful manner is generally considered wrong in social contexts. People are expected to treat others with empathy and kindness, regardless of past interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a history of being bullied, which adds context to his feelings. However, airing those grievances in a public setting while someone else is vulnerable isn't the right approach. There might be healthier ways to process such emotions, like talking to a therapist or a trusted friend, rather than confronting the person who caused the pain in a way that harms them.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are influenced by past trauma, the way he handled the situation was inappropriate. Bragging and expressing a lack of empathy towards someone going through a tough time is inconsiderate and harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
