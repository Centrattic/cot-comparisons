HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging and making a comment about a former bully. \n\nFirst, the context: the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this woman. Now, after overcoming those issues and achieving success, they meet her again. She's in a tough spot as a single mom, and the author brags about their success while he's drunk. The friends think he's an asshole because of his comments.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions were done in a moment of vulnerability, possibly fueled by alcohol. He felt justified because of past bullying. But the question is whether that makes it okay. \n\nEven though he had a hard time before, when they met, she seemed mature and positive. He took the chance to mock her situation. The problem here might be that he's using his current success to belittle her, which can be seen as mean-spirited. Also, he admitted to feeling good that she's suffering, which suggests a vindictive attitude. \n\nEven if he had a reason to feel that way, publicly humiliating someone who is struggling is generally frowned upon. People can have different reactions based on their experiences, but the social norm usually is to be empathetic, especially when someone is already in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe fact that his friends called him an asshole might indicate that his actions went beyond what's socially acceptable. Also, the part where he says he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering definitely crosses a line. That's not just bragging; it's gloating over someone else's misfortune, which is typically seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. He had the chance to show empathy, but instead chose to gloat, which was hurtful and inappropriate. Even if he felt justified, the impact of his actions was negative, making him the asshole in this situation.\n"
