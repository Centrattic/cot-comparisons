HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. The author had a tough high school experience, got his life together, and met this person again. He felt some vindication but went too far by being openly cruel when drunk.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author was bullied in the past, which is valid. But when they met again, he used the opportunity to belittle her. Even though he might feel justified because of past pain, the way he handled the situation was inappropriate. He was drunk, which doesn't excuse the behavior, and he made her feel worse instead of showing empathy. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author targeted someone from his past who was already in a vulnerable position. 2) He bragged about his success in a way that highlighted her struggles. 3) He admitted to feeling good about her suffering, which is a sign of schadenfreude, not a healthy response. 4) His friends called him an asshole, which adds social context. \n\nEven though there's a history of bullying, the author's actions crossed a line. The right thing would have been to acknowledge her situation without rubbing his success in her face. Empathy is important, and while it's hard to feel it for someone who was cruel before, it's still the moral choice. The author's actions were hurtful and vindictive, so he's in the wrong.\n"
