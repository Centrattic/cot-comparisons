HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a 27-year-old with a high-paying job and a good life, but he used to be bullied by a girl named Douchebag in high school. Now he sees her again, she's a single mom working as a waitress, struggling. He brags about his success and ends up being pretty harsh, making her visibly upset. His friends call him an asshole, but he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's been through bullying, which can be really traumatic. He overcame his challenges and is now doing well. When he sees her, he's in a position of power, both in terms of status and his own success. He's drunk when he starts bragging. That's probably not helping. \n\nThe key points here are: Did he cross a line? Was his reaction justified? He mentions wanting to get his feelings out, that he needed to say it. But how does that affect others? Even if he had a bad experience, intentionally making someone else feel bad might be inconsiderate. \n\nHe felt good that she was suffering. That's a red flag. It's one thing to feel that she might not be doing as well as he is, but taking pleasure in someone else's misfortunes is a bit of a problem. It's showing a lack of empathy. \n\nAlso, she was trying to be mature when they met. She didn't recognize him, and he recognized her. She asked about his life, and he asked about hers. Then when she was open about her struggles, he turned it into a bragging session. That's probably not the right way to handle such a meeting. Even if he was drunk, it's his responsibility to consider her feelings. \n\nHe says his friends called him an asshole, but he doesn't think he's wrong. He justifies it by saying he needed to get it out. But maybe that's just an excuse. People can have past hurts, but how they deal with those feelings matters. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions seem to be inconsiderate and hurtful. He took advantage of the situation to vent or take pleasure in her struggles, which isn't acceptable. The fact that he felt good about her suffering is a strong indicator that he's being unkind. \n\nEven though there's a history of bullying, that doesn't give him the right to belittle her current situation. Everyone has their own struggles, and judging someone based on past interactions isn't fair. The author's reaction is more about his own feelings of superiority rather than a genuine attempt to connect or offer support. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A, he is in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where he's dealing with past trauma. However, the way he expressed it was hurtful, so even if he had a bad time, the actions are still wrong.\n"
