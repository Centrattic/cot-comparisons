HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him. \n\nFirst, the context: The author went through a tough time in high school, was bullied by someone named \"Douchebag,\" who was particularly mean. After improving his life through university, he ends up meeting her again. She's now a single mom, struggling, and they have a conversation. The author, who's now successful, starts bragging about his 6-figure job and says he doesn't feel sorry for her, even expressing that he's glad she's suffering. His friends call him an asshole, but he's unsure if it's justified.\n\nSo, the main question is if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key factors here are the intent, the context of their past, the current situation of the other person, and social norms.\n\nThe author was bullied in the past. That's a valid experience of being hurt. However, when they meet again, she's in a vulnerable position as a struggling single mom. Even if she was mean before, his response is to belittle her current struggles. \n\nBragging in this context could be seen as cruel, especially since she's already in a difficult situation. The author might be feeling vindicated because of past mistreatment, but using someone's current hardship to assert his own success is generally considered inconsiderate. \n\nEven if the author has a history of being bullied, that doesn't necessarily justify rubbing his success in her face. People can have different paths, and while the author's life turned around, the woman's current struggles are real. His comments might come off as insensitive, especially when she seems to have matured and even expressed good wishes towards him.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was drunk might reduce his accountability somewhat, but it's not an excuse. The friends' reaction suggests that their behavior was socially unacceptable. The author's own admission that he felt good about her suffering is a red flag because taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune is generally frowned upon.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has a right to feel justified after being bullied. But even so, the way he expressed it was inappropriate. There's a difference between feeling vindicated and acting on it in a hurtful way.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong. His actions were mean-spirited and took advantage of her vulnerable situation, regardless of past experiences.\n"
