HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically someone they had a history with from high school. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time in high school, being bullied by this woman, and now sees her struggling. They meet up, and the author brags about their success while the other person is dealing with her own hardships. The key points here are the power dynamic, the emotional impact on both sides, and societal norms about empathy.\n\nThe author admits they were drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions. But even in that state, they recognized the other person was struggling and chose to be harsh. The friends called them an asshole, which is a social judgment. The author justifies it by saying they needed to release pent-up feelings from past bullying. But does that justify making someone else feel worse, especially when that person is vulnerable?\n\nEmpathy is a big factor here. Even if past interactions were negative, the current situation involves two adults. The author's actions could be seen as taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, which is generally frowned upon. Bragging about their success in a way that highlights the other's struggles might not be helpful or kind. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering shows a lack of compassion. While past experiences can influence emotions, acting on them in a way that harms someone else's feelings is typically considered wrong. The context matters, but it doesn't negate the impact of their words. \n\nThe friends' reaction suggests that the social circle saw it as wrong. The author might be justifying their actions due to past pain, but that doesn't absolve them of the current hurt caused. So, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and harmful, making them at fault.\n"
