HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. So the author is a 27-year-old male who had a tough time in high school, was bullied by this girl he refers to as \"douchebag.\" He's now successful, and when he ran into her again, she was in a bad place as a single mom. He bragged about his success and made some harsh comments when she was already struggling, especially while they were both at a club and he was drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if his actions were wrong. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are the intent and the impact of his actions. The author felt justified because of his past experiences, but others (his friends) called him a huge asshole. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been wronged in the past, retaliating or rubbing success in someone's face when they're struggling isn't considered acceptable. The author's comments were hurtful and he acknowledged that she seemed upset. The fact that he was drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nAlso, the author admits to taking pleasure in her suffering, which is a red flag. While people do have the right to feel a range of emotions, acting on those feelings in a way that harms others is generally seen as wrong. The context of past bullying is important, but it doesn't make the current behavior okay. \n\nThe author's friends disapproved, which suggests that his actions were socially unacceptable. Even if he felt the need to \"get it out of his system,\" there are more constructive ways to handle those emotions without being cruel. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). The actions were hurtful, the intent was to boast and maybe get revenge, and the impact was negative on the other person. The justification based on past experiences doesn't override the harm caused now."
