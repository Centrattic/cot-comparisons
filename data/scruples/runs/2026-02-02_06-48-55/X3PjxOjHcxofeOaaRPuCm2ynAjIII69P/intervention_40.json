HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is now successful, ran into someone from their past who had been a bully. They were both in high school, and this person, let's call her \"douchebag,\" was mean to the author. Now, the author sees her again and finds out that she's struggling as a single mom. The author then proceeds to brag about their success, even saying they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's having a hard time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author did experience bullying, which is tough. But now, they took the opportunity to confront that person with their current success, especially when the other person was being vulnerable by talking about her struggles. The author was drunk, which might affect behavior, but that's not an excuse for being hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are about empathy and respect. Even if the other person was a bully in the past, the author is now in a position to either let go of that past or to use it as a reason to be cruel. The author admits to feeling good that the other person is suffering, which sounds like schadenfreude. But does that justify being mean? Probably not. The person the author is talking to was open and shared her struggles, and the author took that moment to belittle her instead of offering support or at least being more sensitive.\n\nAlso, the friends said the author was an asshole, which adds to the idea that this behavior isn't socially acceptable. Even if the author had a difficult time in the past, they can't just take pleasure in someone else's misfortune. The fact that the author felt the need to \"get it out of their system\" doesn't absolve them of the hurt caused. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the conversation went. The author turned a potentially positive interaction into a negative one by focusing on their own success and the other's struggles. It's important to differentiate between sharing one's success and gloating. The author crossed the line into bragging and being unsympathetic, which is inconsiderate, especially when the other person was already in a vulnerable state.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong. They should have approached the situation with more empathy, even if they wanted to address the past. The way they handled it was hurtful and disrespectful, regardless of their past experiences.\n"
