HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl, later meets her when she's struggling as a single mom. The author, who's now successful, brags about their life and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of bullying, which is definitely tough. They worked hard and improved their life, which is commendable. But when they meet this person again, they decide to rub their success in her face. Even though they were drunk, the intention seems to be about getting some sort of satisfaction from her suffering after past pain.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author was bullied, which is understandable, but does that justify their actions? The other person is a single mom with two kids, working as a waitress, struggling. The author's comments were hurtful and made the other person visibly upset. Even if they felt they needed to \"get it out of their system,\" was this the right way?\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole, which is a sign that their actions weren't socially acceptable. The author mentions feeling good that she was suffering, which might be a form of schadenfreude. But is that justified? It's one thing to feel that someone's past actions were wrong, but taking pleasure in their misfortune can be seen as cruel.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk when this happened. While alcohol doesn't excuse bad behavior, it might have lowered their inhibitions. However, the decision to speak that way was conscious, even if impaired. The author could have chosen to be kind or at least neutral, but instead chose to be hurtful.\n\nAnother angle: The author's past trauma might affect their current actions. They might still hold onto resentment from the bullying. However, adults are generally expected to handle such feelings maturely, not act on them in a way that harms others. The fact that they felt the need to brag suggests unresolved issues, but that doesn't make their actions right.\n\nIn terms of empathy, the single mother is in a difficult situation. The author's comments, while possibly rooted in past hurt, don't consider her current struggles. The author might not realize that their words could be adding to her stress. Even if the woman wasn't particularly remorseful in the past, the author's response is unkind and lacks compassion.\n\nSo putting it all together, while the author has a history of being bullied, their actions were unkind and taken advantage of a vulnerable moment for the other person. The intent to \"get it out of their system\" by being mean doesn't justify the behavior. People are generally expected to act with kindness regardless of past events, especially when the current person is going through hard times. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
