HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a struggling single mother they had a history with. The author was bullied by this woman in high school, and now years later, they meet again. The author, who's now successful, starts to brag when they find out the woman is working as a waitress and raising two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of bullying in the past, which is significant. They transformed their life, which is positive. However, when they meet the bully again, they take the opportunity to rub their success in her face. The key point here is whether the author's actions were justified given their past.\n\nThe author mentions they were drunk when they made these comments, which might affect judgment. They also say they felt good that she was suffering, which suggests a desire for some form of retribution or schadenfreude. But is that a valid reason to be cruel?\n\nThe woman, despite being a bully in the past, is now a struggling single mother. The author's friends called them a \"huge asshole,\" indicating that the behavior crossed a line. The author might feel justified because of the past treatment, but the situation isn't about past grievances\u2014it's about the current interaction. Even if someone has wronged you in the past, it's generally considered poor behavior to belittle them when they're in a vulnerable position now.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as unkind and lacking empathy. The woman might have changed or be dealing with her own challenges. The author's response might be more about their own unresolved feelings from the past rather than a justifiable reaction. The question is whether the author's actions were appropriate, regardless of past events.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people are generally expected to treat others with kindness, even if they were wronged before. The author's bragging and lack of compassion, especially when the other person is struggling, is likely to be viewed as inconsiderate and rude. The fact that the author's friends criticized them supports the idea that the behavior was socially unacceptable.\n\nSo, while the author has a valid history of being a victim, their current actions don't make them right. The way to handle past pain isn't by rubbing it in someone's face when they're vulnerable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
