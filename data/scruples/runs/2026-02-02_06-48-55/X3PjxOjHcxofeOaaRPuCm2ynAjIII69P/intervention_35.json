HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mother. The situation has a lot of context, so I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the author had a tough high school experience with the girl, who was mean to him. He worked hard in university, improved his life, and now has a good job. When they meet again, he's drunk and starts bragging about his success while pointing out her struggles. He even says he's glad she's suffering and doesn't feel sorry for her. His friends call him an asshole for being \"savage,\" but he feels it was justified because of his past with her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: past bullying, current success vs. her current struggles, the act of bragging while she's in a vulnerable position, and the emotional impact on her. The author might feel he's justified because of the past, but is that acceptable?\n\nEthically, even if someone has been wronged in the past, retaliating in a way that causes harm (even if unintended) can be problematic. The author's actions were hurtful, especially given the context of her being a struggling mother. Bragging about success when someone is in a difficult position can be seen as insensitive. Also, the fact that he was drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it's not an excuse.\n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, which suggests that social norms view his actions as inappropriate. Even if he felt a need to vent, the way he expressed it was inconsiderate and harmful. The fact that he felt \"good\" about her suffering shows a lack of empathy, which is a key component in determining moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong). He crossed a line by belittling someone else's struggles, especially when he was in a position of power due to his success and the circumstances of their meeting. Past experiences don't give permission to hurt others, even if they've hurt you before.\n"
