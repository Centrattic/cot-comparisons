HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 27-year-old man who had a tough time in high school, being bullied by someone he calls \"douchebag.\" Now, he's successful with a high-paying job and is engaged. He ran into this ex-bully, who is now a struggling single mom with two kids. The author bragged about his success while she was working as a waitress and struggling. He even told her he didn't feel sorry for her and was glad she was having a hard time. His friends called him an asshole, but he feels like he needed to let it out. The user thinks he's in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the context of past bullying and the current interaction. The author had a legitimate experience of being bullied, which shaped his negative feelings towards the woman. Now, she's in a worse position, and he took the chance to brag and express his satisfaction in her suffering. \n\nBut even though he had a rough time, does that justify his actions? Bullying is never acceptable, and holding a grudge for years might not be healthy. Even if someone has been wronged, taking pleasure in another's suffering could be considered cruel. The author might feel justified because of his past, but from an external perspective, it's about how we treat others, especially when they're vulnerable. \n\nAlso, he was drunk and maybe not in the best state of mind. However, that doesn't excuse the behavior. He had a choice in what he said. Even if the woman was a bully before, she's a human being now, a struggling mother. His comments about her job and her situation could be seen as insensitive and prideful. \n\nThe author's justification is that he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" but that's more about his own emotional release rather than considering her feelings. The friends' reaction suggests that what he did was harsh, which might indicate that even people around him see it as wrong. \n\nIn terms of morality, most would argue that taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune isn't right, regardless of past interactions. It perpetuates a cycle of negativity and doesn't contribute to personal growth or healing. The author might have unresolved issues from the bullying, but acting out in that way doesn't resolve them. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though there's context, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
