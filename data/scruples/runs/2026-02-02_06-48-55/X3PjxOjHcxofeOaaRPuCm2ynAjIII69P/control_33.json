HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a 27-year-old man who had a tough high school experience, including bullying from a girl named Douchebag. Now, after succeeding in life, he meets her again and brags about his success while she's struggling. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author mentions he was bullied in high school and that this girl was particularly mean. He's now successful, and when he meets her again, she's in a tough spot. He brags about his 6-figure job while she's a struggling single mother working as a waitress. He gets drunk and says some harsh things, making her visibly upset. His friends call him an asshole, but he feels justified because of his past.\n\nSo, the key points here are: he was a victim of bullying, but now he's in a position to taunt her. The issue is whether his actions are justified. Even though he had a hard time, his response seems to cross a line. He's using his success to mock someone else's struggles, which is not appropriate. \n\nBragging in such a context can be seen as cruel. Even if he's not feeling sorry for her, openly mocking someone else's difficult situation is generally considered wrong. The fact that he felt good about her suffering shows a lack of empathy. People can have different paths in life; maybe she's facing her own challenges that he doesn't know about. \n\nAlso, the author's friends criticized his behavior, which suggests that socially, his actions were not accepted. While there's context of past bullying, revenge or gloating isn't a socially acceptable response. The key here is that the author's actions were hurtful, regardless of his past. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of karma or Schadenfreude, where someone feels happy about another's misfortune. While it's human to feel that way, acting on it in a hurtful manner is problematic. The author's actions were direct and confrontational, which adds to the wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong. Even though he has a history of being bullied, his response was inappropriate and unkind. Everyone makes mistakes, but intentionally making someone else feel bad, especially in a vulnerable situation, is generally considered wrong.\n"
