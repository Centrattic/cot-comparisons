HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who now has a successful life, ran into someone from their past who was a bully. The person they met up with ended up struggling as a single mother. The author bragged about their success while the other person was in a tough spot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in high school by this person. That's a significant part of the story. They've come a long way and are now doing well. The encounter happened when the author was drunk, which might contribute to the situation. But even so, was their behavior justified?\n\nThe key point here is the author's reaction. They bragged and even said they didn't feel sorry for the other person, finding satisfaction in her struggles. While past trauma can influence someone's actions, it doesn't necessarily make their current behavior acceptable. The other person was in a vulnerable situation, and the author took the chance to belittle her.\n\nEven though there's a history of bullying, confronting someone in person to express that resentment might come across as cruel, especially when the person is already struggling. The friends thought the author was being an asshole, which is a common reaction. The author might feel justified due to past experiences, but causing emotional harm in the moment is still wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they felt good about the other person suffering. That's a red flag. While it's natural to feel some satisfaction when someone who was mean to you isn't doing well, acting on those feelings to hurt them further is not the right approach. It's important to consider empathy and the current situation of the other person. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even with the context, the author's actions were inappropriate. They had the chance to meet someone from their past, and instead of showing compassion or letting the past go, they chose to rub their success in. That's unkind and doesn't take into account the current struggles of the other person. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
