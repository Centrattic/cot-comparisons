HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him. The situation is pretty clear: the author had a rough time in high school being bullied by this girl, now he's successful and they meet again. He ends up bragging about his success, making her feel upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in the past, which is a valid experience of being mistreated. However, even if someone has a history of being bullied, does that justify bragging when they meet someone who used to bully them? The key here is the action of bragging and the emotional impact it had on the other person. \n\nThe author mentions he was drunk when this happened. While being drunk might affect someone's judgment, it doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior. The friends called him an asshole, so there's a social judgment there. The author justifies it by saying he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" but that might not be a valid excuse from an ethical standpoint. \n\nAlso, the fact that the former bully is now struggling doesn't mean the author is entitled to take pleasure in her suffering. Even if someone has wronged you in the past, it's important to consider their current situation. The woman is a single mother, which is a challenging role, and the author's comments could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThere's a moral aspect here. The author might feel justified because of past experiences, but causing someone else emotional distress, even if they were a bully before, isn't acceptable. People can change, and the author's actions don't contribute to a positive resolution of past conflicts. \n\nIn terms of social ethics, it's generally expected to rise above past grudges, especially when the other person is in a vulnerable position. The author's behavior could be seen as taking advantage of the situation to vent his own feelings rather than showing empathy or moving past the conflict. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author has a history of being bullied, his actions in this situation are inconsiderate and harmful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
