HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl, now called \"douchebag.\" He's had a turnaround in life, got successful, and now meets her again. She's in a tough spot, a single mom working as a waitress. The author, drunk at a club, starts bragging about his success and even says he's glad she's suffering.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, even though there's a history of bullying, the way he confronted her seems harsh. He was in a position where she was vulnerable, struggling with two kids. Bragging and expressing schadenfreude (taking pleasure in her misfortune) might not be justified. People often say that they have the right to feel a certain way, but actions have consequences. Even if he was hurt before, the way he reacted could be seen as cruel. His friends called him an asshole, which is a common reaction.\n\nOn the flip side, he was drunk and maybe venting. But that's not an excuse. Also, he felt good that she was suffering, which might indicate a desire for some form of revenge or validation. But the key here is that he took the moment to belittle someone who's already struggling, which is generally considered inconsiderate and mean.\n\nThe moral of the story is that even if someone wronged you in the past, rubbing their face in your success when they're down is not appropriate. It's about empathy. She might be dealing with a lot, and his comments could have made her feel worse. The author's actions crossed a line, even if he had a rough past with her. So, yeah, I think he's in the wrong.\n"
