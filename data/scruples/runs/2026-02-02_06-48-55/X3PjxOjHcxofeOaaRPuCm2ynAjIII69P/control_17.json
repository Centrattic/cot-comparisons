HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a former bully who's now struggling. The situation is pretty specific, so I need to analyze the context carefully.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl bullied him in high school and university wasn't any better for her. Now, they meet again, and she's a struggling single mom. The author, feeling drunk and maybe a bit vindictive, brags about their success and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. His friends call him an asshole, but he's unsure if it's justified because he feels like he had a right to feel that way.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent, the context of past bullying, the current emotional state of both parties, and societal norms about empathy. The author's actions were intentional bragging, which can be seen as cruel, even if they had a history of being bullied. The woman is in a tough situation now, and the author's comments might be adding to her emotional distress. Even if he felt justified, causing someone emotional pain, especially someone who's already struggling, is generally considered inconsiderate. However, the author's own history of being bullied might affect their perspective. \n\nBut here's the thing: while it's valid to have lingering feelings from past bullying, acting on those feelings in a way that harms the other person is not acceptable. The author could have chosen to acknowledge their past without being cruel. The fact that the woman was mature and friendly during the conversation suggests she might have been trying to move past the past, and the author's response was unkind. Also, being drunk might have lowered his inhibitions, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nSo, even though the author had a history of being bullied, the way they responded was inconsiderate and hurtful. The key takeaway is that while past experiences shape our feelings, how we act on them affects others. The author's actions crossed a line by deriving satisfaction from someone else's misfortune, which is generally seen as callous. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
