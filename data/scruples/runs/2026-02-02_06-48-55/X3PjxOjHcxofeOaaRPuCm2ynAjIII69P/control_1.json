HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, especially in the context they described. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a bad high school experience with this girl, who was mean and bullied him. Now, after he's successful, they meet again, and he ends up being confrontational and belittling her when she's in a tough spot. The key points here are the history of bullying, the current context where both are adults, and the author's actions during their encounter.\n\nThe author admits to bragging about his success while she's a single mom struggling as a waitress. Even though he was drunk, he says he felt good that she was suffering and isn't sure if that makes him an asshole. His friends called him a huge asshole, but he thinks they don't understand his need to release his feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether this makes him the asshole. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone was wronged in the past, it's not considered acceptable to rub their struggles in someone else's face, especially if that person is vulnerable. The author had the chance to let go of past grudges and maybe offer support or at least maintain empathy. Instead, he chose to highlight her struggles and express a lack of sympathy. \n\nAlso, the fact that he felt good about her suffering suggests a lack of compassion. While people can have justified anger or resentment, acting on it in a way that harms another person, even if they were once unkind, is generally seen as wrong. The situation has changed; both are adults now. Holding onto old grievances and lashing out when someone is in a difficult situation is not considered morally right. \n\nMoreover, the author's actions were hurtful. Even if he was drunk, he was aware of her situation and chose to respond negatively. The friends' reaction that he was being an asshole seems valid. It's one thing to feel justified in one's feelings, but it's another to act on them in a way that's cruel. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
