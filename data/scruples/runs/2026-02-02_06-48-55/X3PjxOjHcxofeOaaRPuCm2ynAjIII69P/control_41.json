HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author confronting someone (dubbed \"Douchebag\") from their past who had bullied them. Now, the author has a successful life, while the former bully is a struggling single mother. The author admits to bragging about their success and expressing schadenfreude when they met, leading to the other person feeling upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author was bullied in the past, which is a valid hardship. However, as an adult, does that justify their actions in this encounter? The key points are the context of their past and the current situation. \n\nThe author is in a position of power here, both in terms of social standing and financial success. They mention being drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The question is whether expressing satisfaction at someone else's suffering is acceptable, even if there's a history of being bullied by that person. \n\nThe other person, despite her current struggles, interacted in a mature and positive way. She was happy to see the author and inquired about their well-being. The author's response was not just sharing their success, but actively rubbing it in, which is considered rude and insensitive. The friends' reaction that the author was being a \"huge asshole\" supports that viewpoint. \n\nEven if the author felt wronged in the past, taking pleasure in someone's misfortune is generally seen as unkind. Society often values empathy and kindness, even towards those who have wronged you. The author's actions could be seen as vindictive rather than justified. \n\nThe moral of the story here leans towards the idea that while past experiences can shape us, how we handle current interactions reflects our character. The author's behavior was inappropriate regardless of their history. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
