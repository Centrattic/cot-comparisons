HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was bullied by this girl in high school, which affected them a lot. Now, they've turned their life around with a good job and a happy engagement. They run into the ex-bullying friend, who's a single mom struggling as a waitress.\n\nThe key part is when the author starts bragging about their success while the other person is clearly in a tough spot. Even though the author had a history of being bullied, they chose to confront the situation by putting the other person down. The friends called them an asshole, which adds to the social judgment here.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. Bullying in the past doesn't give someone the right to humiliate someone else when they're vulnerable. The author was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but it's not an excuse. The other person was already in a hard place, and the author's comments were harsh and unkind. \n\nEven if the author felt justified because of past experiences, taking pleasure in someone else's suffering isn't right. People can change, and maybe the ex-bully had her reasons or has faced her own struggles. The author didn't show empathy, which is a key part of being considerate. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took advantage of the situation to boast and make the other person feel worse, which is hurtful regardless of past interactions.\n"
