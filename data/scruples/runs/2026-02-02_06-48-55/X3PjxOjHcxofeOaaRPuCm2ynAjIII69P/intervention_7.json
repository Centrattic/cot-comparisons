HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically an old bully from his past. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was bullied by this girl in high school, which affected him a lot. Now that he's successful, he ran into her when he went back to his hometown. She's a single mother, struggling, and they had a conversation. The author, while drunk, started to brag about his success and even said he wasn't sorry for her situation. His friends criticized him, but he's questioning if it's justified.\n\nSo, the key points here: he was a victim of bullying, now sees his bully in a worse position, and acted out. The question is about right and wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he had a bad experience with her in the past. Maybe he felt empowered by his success and wanted to confront her. But on the other hand, she's a struggling single mother now. Even if she was mean before, she's in a hard place now. The author's actions might be seen as cruel or unkind, especially since she didn't recognize him at first and seemed to have matured. \n\nAlso, the author admits to feeling good that she's suffering. That could indicate a desire for revenge or schadenfreude, which might be considered negative. Even if he had a hard time before, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune isn't looked upon favorably. \n\nThe context is important. He wasn't just bragging to someone randomly; it was someone who had a negative impact on his life. But does that justify his behavior? Maybe not. Everyone has a right to their own mistakes, and someone's past actions don't negate their current struggles. \n\nThe fact that he was drunk might mitigate the severity, but it doesn't excuse it. He's still accountable for his actions, especially if he was coherent enough to realize she was upset. \n\nHis friends called him an asshole, which adds social pressure, but he's conflicted because he felt it was necessary to \"get it out of his system.\" That suggests unresolved feelings about his past. However, dealing with those feelings in a public, hurtful way isn't the healthiest approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were hurtful and unkind, regardless of his past. While the context of being bullied might explain some of his motivations, it doesn't justify the way he treated her. The right answer here would be that he's in the wrong. He should have been empathetic and used this as a chance to move past his old trauma instead of rubbing his success in her face.\n"
