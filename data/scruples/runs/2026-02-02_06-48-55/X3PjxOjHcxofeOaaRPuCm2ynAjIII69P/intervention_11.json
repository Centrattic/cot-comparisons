HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who previously bullied him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied by this girl, \"Douchebag,\" in high school. He had a hard time, and she was particularly mean. Now, years later, he's successful, and they meet again. She's a single mom, struggling, and he feels a sense of vindication.\n\nSo, he brags about his success when she's in a tough spot. He was drunk, which might affect his judgment. He even says he felt good that she's suffering. His friends called him an asshole for it. \n\nThe key points here are: the history of bullying, the author's emotional state (being drunk, maybe seeking validation), and the way he reacted. Even though there's context, the act of rubbing it in someone's face, especially when they're vulnerable, could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe author argues that he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" but that doesn't necessarily justify being mean. People often have unresolved feelings, but expressing them in a hurtful way isn't okay. Also, he's taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, which is a classic sign of schadenfreude. \n\nEven if she was a bully in the past, she's a single mother now, and he had the chance to show empathy. Instead, he chose to mock her situation. That's where the wrongdoing lies. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, some might argue that he's justified because of her past behavior. But the situation is complicated by the fact that he was drunk and the context of their meeting. Also, he didn't confront her about her past but instead focused on his own success. It's more about his need to feel better than her rather than addressing the past. \n\nTherefore, despite the context, his actions were inappropriate and hurtful. So, the answer is A.\n"
