HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who was once bullied by a girl in high school, later meets her again after both have had different life trajectories. The author now has a successful life, and while drunk, he brags about his success to the girl who is struggling as a single mother. The author justifies this by saying he needed to \"get it out of his system\" because of past bullying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had negative experiences in high school, which is understandable. But when they meet again, the girl seems to have matured and is struggling. The author, instead of showing empathy, uses this opportunity to mock her situation. Even though he was drunk, the actions were intentional\u2014bragging and making a snide comment about her suffering.\n\nThe key points here are empathy, the context of their past relationship, and the appropriateness of the author's actions. Even though he was bullied before, does that justify belittling someone who might be vulnerable now? The author was in a position to offer support or at least show compassion, but instead chose to highlight his own success in a way that was hurtful. \n\nAlso, the fact that he felt good about her suffering complicates things. It suggests a lack of empathy, which is generally considered a negative trait in social interactions. The friends who called him an asshole might be right because the situation doesn't warrant such a response. Even if there was past resentment, there's a difference between addressing past issues and rubbing success in someone's face when they're in a tough spot.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. He had the opportunity to connect or at least be respectful, but his choice to brag and mock her situation was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
