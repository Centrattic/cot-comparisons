HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. The author had a tough high school time, was bullied by a girl named Douchebag. Now, after he's successful, they meet again, and he brags about his 6-figure salary while she's a waitress with two kids. He says he felt good that she's suffering and isn't sure if it's justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was a victim of bullying in the past, and now they've achieved success. When they meet the person who bullied them, they're in a position of power and choose to highlight the contrast. The key points here are the intent, the manner of communication, and the context of their past.\n\nThe author mentions they were pretty drunk when this happened. That might be a mitigating factor, as alcohol can lower inhibitions and affect judgment. But even so, the action still occurred. They say they \"needed to get it out of my system,\" which suggests unresolved feelings. But does that justify the behavior?\n\nNow, the person they're talking about is a struggling single mother. That's a vulnerable position. Bragging about one's success in such a context, especially to someone who was previously unkind, could be seen as cruel. The author's friends called them a \"huge asshole,\" which might reflect common social judgment here. \n\nHowever, the author might feel that the bullying was justified or that the person deserved it. But the fact that the woman was unaware of the author's identity and was being polite could complicate things. She didn't recognize him, so she was being mature and accepting his compliments, maybe trying to be civil. The author's response was to bring up her current struggles and express a lack of sympathy, which could be hurtful even if there's a history. \n\nThe ethical consideration here is whether it's acceptable to express schadenfreude (taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune) even if there's a past where that person was mean. People often face past hardships and may have grown or changed. The author's actions might be seen as holding a grudge and rubbing salt in the wound, especially when the other person isn't in a position to retaliate. \n\nAlso, the author is in a better place now, but that doesn't give them the right to belittle someone else's current situation. It's possible that the woman's life has improved since, but the author is choosing to highlight her struggles. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, even if the person was previously unkind, it's generally frowned upon to mock or belittle someone when they're in a vulnerable position, especially if they are trying to be polite and engage in conversation. The author's statement about not feeling sorry for her and being glad she's suffering seems harsh and could be considered toxic. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intention might be rooted in past pain, but acting on it in a way that's hurtful to another person, even if they were once unkind, is likely inconsiderate and unkind. The fact that they felt good about it might indicate a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
