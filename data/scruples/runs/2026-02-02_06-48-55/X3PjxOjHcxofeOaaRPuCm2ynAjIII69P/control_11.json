HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, a 27-year-old guy with a high-paying job and an engagement, is reflecting on his past. He was bullied in high school by a girl he calls \"douchebag.\" After university, he transformed his life, both physically and professionally. He ran into this girl, who is now a struggling single mother in her late 20s, working as a waitress. When they met at a nightclub, he ended up bragging about his success while she was clearly struggling. He even went as far as to say he wasn't feeling sorry for her and was glad she was suffering. His friends called him an asshole, but he's unsure if he's justified because of his past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time in high school, which makes sense why he might have lingering feelings. But when he met her again, she didn't recognize him and was actually nice to him. He took the opportunity to boast about his own success, which could be seen as rubbing salt in the wound. Even though he was drunk, the actions were intentional. \n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) Did he have the right to do that? 2) Is his feeling of satisfaction justified? 3) Is it acceptable to take out past grievances on someone who might not even be aware of their past actions?\n\nBragging in a situation where someone is already struggling could be hurtful. Even if the person was a bully before, the author's actions might be considered cruel. The fact that she was a single mother adds to the complexity\u2014her current struggles might be due to various factors beyond high school behavior. The author's comments could minimize her current challenges and imply a kind of schadenfreude that's inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was just expressing his own success and maybe even finding closure. But the way he did it was to her face, which could be seen as mean-spirited. The friends' reaction suggests that their behavior was socially unacceptable. Even if the author feels justified, society often values empathy and kindness over taking pleasure in others' misfortunes, even if they were once bullies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were likely inconsiderate and unkind. He had the chance to either ignore the past or address it in a more mature way, but instead chose to boast and derive satisfaction from her struggles. That seems to be the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
