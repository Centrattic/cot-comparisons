HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically an old bully from his past. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a tough time in high school due to bullying by this girl, \"Douchebag.\" Later, he succeeded in life, got a good job, and now encounters her again. When they meet, he's drunk and starts bragging about his success, making her feel bad. His friends criticized him, but he feels justified because of their past.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's actions during their encounter, 2) His emotional state (drunk, feeling justified), 3) The impact on the other person, and 4) Whether this justifies his behavior.\n\nEven though there's a history of bullying, does that give him the right to mock or belittle her when she's in a vulnerable position now? People make mistakes, and holding a grudge might not be healthy. Also, bragging about one's success when someone else is struggling can be seen as insensitive, regardless of past conflicts. The author's satisfaction in her suffering is part of the issue here. It's about how we treat others, even those who've wronged us in the past. Society generally values forgiveness and empathy over gloating. So, while the past bullying was wrong, the author's response might be considered unkind and petty. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
