HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for what they did. The situation involves someone who used to bully the author in high school, and now that the author is successful, they met again. The author ended up bragging and even said they don't feel sorry for the former bully and are glad she's struggling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of bullying in the past, which is a significant factor. They overcame their struggles and achieved success, which is commendable. The meeting happens in a bar where the former bully didn't recognize them at first. The author then, while drunk, starts bragging about their success and makes negative comments about the other's current situation. The friends called them out for being an asshole, but the author feels justified because of the past bullying.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the act of bragging, the context of past bullying, and the current emotional state of both parties. Even though the author had a history of being bullied, bragging and expressing schadenfreude (taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune) can still be considered wrong. The author's comments were hurtful and could be seen as retaliating, which might not be appropriate even if someone has been wronged before.\n\nThe author's justification is that they needed to get it out, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior. The fact that they felt good about the other person's suffering might indicate a lack of empathy, which is generally frowned upon in social interactions. Even if there was a past conflict, showing compassion or at least maintaining respect is usually the expected social norm. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since the other person had matured and was trying to engage in a positive conversation.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friends pointed out that they were an asshole, which is a common reaction in such situations. The drunkenness might mitigate some responsibility, but it doesn't fully excuse the behavior. People are still expected to maintain some level of decorum and empathy, even if they're under the influence.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's past experiences are valid and the former bully's actions were wrong, the way the author responded was inappropriate. The bragging and lack of empathy in the current interaction make the author at fault here. So the answer would be A for Yes.\n"
