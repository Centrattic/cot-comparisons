HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was bullied by this girl (Douchebag) during high school. He had a rough time, but now he's successful. They meet again, and he feels a mix of emotions. He starts bragging about his success while she's a struggling single mom. He even says he feels good that she's suffering and that he's glad she's having a hard time.\n\nSo, the main points to consider. The author was a victim of bullying, which is serious. But his response now is to rub his success in her face, especially when she's in a vulnerable situation. He was drunk, which might lower his inhibitions, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The key issue here is empathy. Even though she was a bully before, she's now a single mom facing her own struggles. The author's actions seem to lack compassion. \n\nHe mentions that he needed to get it out, but that's more of an excuse than a justification. People who were bullied might have residual anger or resentment, but acting out in a way that's hurtful when the person is vulnerable isn't the right approach. The friends called him an asshole, which is a common reaction because bragging in such a scenario is generally seen as cruel. \n\nAlso, the part where he says he \"doesn't feel sorry for her\" and is glad she's suffering is pretty harsh. It shows a lack of empathy towards someone who is in a difficult situation. Even if someone wronged you in the past, that doesn't give you the right to be unkind when they're struggling. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were mean-spirited and lacked empathy. While the past bullying is a valid context, his response is not justified. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
