HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mother.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough time in high school, being bullied by this girl. Now, they've turned their life around with a successful job and are engaged. They saw this girl again, she didn't recognize them at first, but once they started talking, the author began to boast about their success while the girl was being honest about her struggles. The author even admitted to feeling good that she's suffering and said they didn't feel sorry for her. \n\nThe key points here are the context of past bullying and the current interaction. The author was drunk, which might affect judgment, but that doesn't excuse hurtful behavior. The friends called them an asshole, which is a social red flag. The author justifies it by saying they needed to get it out, but taking out past pain on someone else, especially when they're vulnerable, isn't a good excuse. \n\nEven if the girl was a bully before, the author's actions now are about their own success and her struggles. The act of gloating and making her feel worse, especially when she seemed to be trying to be mature and friendly, crosses a line. It's important to consider empathy here. The author might have valid past grievances, but responding with cruelty in the present doesn't help anyone. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their actions were justified. While the context of being bullied is significant, the response was unkind and opportunistic. People can change, and the author's reaction might prevent any chance of closure or understanding. Bragging in someone else's face about their struggles, even if you've had a tough past, isn't right. It perpetuates negativity and could harm someone already in a difficult situation. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind, even if they had a history. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
