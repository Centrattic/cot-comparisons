HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him. The situation has a lot of context.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough time in high school, being bullied by someone he calls \"douchebag.\" He managed to turn his life around, got a good job, and is engaged. Now, he runs into this person again, who's a single mom struggling with her life. He was drunk, started bragging about his success, and made a comment about not feeling sorry for her and being glad she's suffering.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: past bullying, current success vs. her current struggles, and the manner in which he addressed her.\n\nThe author says he felt good that she was suffering. That's a red flag. Even if someone has a history of being unkind, taking pleasure in their struggles is generally seen as mean-spirited. The situation is further complicated by the fact that he confronted her while she was in a vulnerable position\u2014raising two kids as a single mother and working as a waitress. \n\nHe was drunk, which might affect his judgment, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The friends called him an asshole, and the main issue here is that he used the encounter to boast and express schadenfreude. Even if he had a hard time before, taking it out on someone who's struggling now isn't justifiable. Empathy and kindness are important, especially when someone is in a tough spot. While it's okay to share your own success, doing so in a way that belittles or takes pleasure in another's misfortune crosses a line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he used the opportunity to brag and express malice rather than showing some level of compassion, even if his past was difficult. The fact that he felt justified in feeling good about her suffering is a key point against him.\n"
