HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong after bragging to a former bully who's now struggling as a single mother. The author feels justified because he was bullied by her in the past and now sees her in a worse situation. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had a tough time being bullied by this girl, who called him names and made fun of him. Now that he's successful and she's a struggling single mom, he meets her again, she seems more mature, and he decides to brag about his success, even making a harsh comment about not feeling sorry for her.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and his justification. He was drunk, which might affect his judgment, but even then, targeting someone in a vulnerable situation could be problematic. The friends think he was a jerk, but he feels it's his way of dealing with past trauma.\n\nIs it wrong to feel happy that someone who wronged you is suffering? Maybe, because it's not about their suffering but about your actions. Even if he was hurt, publicly shaming or belittling someone who's struggling now, especially when they seem to have mellowed or are in a tough spot, crosses a line. It's important to consider empathy. She's a single mom working as a waitress, which is tough on its own. Adding his taunts might make her situation harder.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that she was glad to see him and complimented him, but he still chose to focus on her struggles. This could be seen as unkind and exploiting their meeting to get a sense of superiority. Even if he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" doing so in that manner is inconsiderate. There might be healthier ways to process his past without hurting someone else now.\n\nAnother angle: karma. He might feel that her bad actions led to her downfall, but that's a personal belief. However, judging others for their life choices isn't his place, especially if he doesn't know the full story. Maybe she's had her own hardships he's unaware of.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were definitely inconsiderate and cruel, especially given the context of her current situation. Even if he felt justified, it's not acceptable to take pleasure in someone else's misfortune, especially an ex-bully. The answer should be A for yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
