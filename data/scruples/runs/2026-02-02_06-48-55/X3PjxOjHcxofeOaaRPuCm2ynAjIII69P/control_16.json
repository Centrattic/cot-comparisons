HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who previously bullied him. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author was bullied by this woman in high school and later saw her struggling in life. He felt a sense of vindication and couldn't resist bragging about his success. Now, the question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has a history of being a bully, publicly belittling them when they're in a vulnerable situation seems harsh. The author was drunk, which might have lowered his inhibitions, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. The key points here are empathy and the intent behind his actions. \n\nThe woman was a single mother working as a waitress, which is already a tough situation. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerability. Even if he has a history with her, the way he handled the interaction was disrespectful. His friends called him an asshole, which is a common reaction in such scenarios. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of personal history. The woman did bully him, and he might feel a sense of closure or satisfaction seeing her face the consequences. But does that justify his actions? Probably not. People are complex, and even if she was a bully, she's a human being in a difficult situation now. The author's response was not just bragging but also expressing a lack of empathy, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people might understand the feeling of wanting to show success after past hardships, the way he communicated it was unkind. The line between sharing one's success and rubbing it in is thin. The author crossed that line by being harsh and dismissive, especially when she was already struggling. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were inappropriate. Even though there's context, the manner in which he addressed her was unkind and lacked empathy. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
