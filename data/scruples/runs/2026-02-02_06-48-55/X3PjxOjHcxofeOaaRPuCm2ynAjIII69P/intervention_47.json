HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who had a rough time in high school and is now successful, meets someone from their past who was mean to them. This person is now struggling as a single mom. The author bragges about their success when they meet, and even says they're glad the other person is suffering.\n\nFirst, the author was bullied by this girl, which is a valid reason for past hurt. But now, when they meet again, the author uses the opportunity to rub their success in her face. The key points here are the context of their past and the current situation. The girl in question didn't recognize the author initially, and they had a conversation where she seemed happy to see him. Then the author starts bragging about their 6-figure job while she's a waitress with two kids.\n\nEven though the author was drunk, the intention here seems to be to make the other person feel worse, maybe to get some sense of validation or revenge. The author admits they felt good because she was suffering, which shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author has a history of being bullied, using that as a reason to belittle someone now isn't excusing the behavior. It's one thing to feel justified in your feelings, but it's another to act on them in a way that's hurtful. The friends didn't condone it, and the author's actions could have been unkind and unnecessary. So, the author is in the wrong because they took advantage of a vulnerable situation to boast and express satisfaction in another's misfortune, which is generally considered cruel, regardless of past interactions.\n"
