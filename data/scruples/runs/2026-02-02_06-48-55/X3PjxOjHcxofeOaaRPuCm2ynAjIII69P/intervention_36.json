HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother about his success, especially since they had a past where he was bullied by her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time in high school, being bullied by this person. He managed to turn his life around, which is great. But when they reunite later in life, he uses the chance to brag about his success while she's in a difficult situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions and intentions. He was drunk and started to talk about how much better his life is compared to hers. He even went as far as saying he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. His friends called him an asshole, and he's conflicted because he feels justified due to past experiences.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if someone has been a bully in the past, it's generally considered wrong to rub success in their face when they're struggling. People can change, and holding onto past hurts might not be the healthiest approach. Also, the author's satisfaction in her suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is usually frowned upon.\n\nBut there's also the angle of personal history. The author was a victim of bullying, which is serious. However, does that give him the right to be cruel now? Maybe not. It's possible to acknowledge past wrongs without being vindictive. The situation is complicated because of the past, but the response seems excessive and unkind.\n\nSo, even though there's context, the author's actions during their meeting were hurtful and unkind. The fact that he took pleasure in her current struggles, regardless of past issues, is where he's in the wrong. It's about how we treat others, even those who have wronged us before.\n"
