HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. The scenario is complex, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being bullied by this woman, which lasted until he was 18. That's significant because it shows a long-term negative experience. Then, after his life improved through university and his career, he encounters her again. She's now a struggling single mother, and he's drunk when he starts bragging about his success. He even says he's glad she's suffering, which is pretty harsh.\n\nThe key points here are the context of past bullying, the current emotional state of both parties, and the appropriateness of the author's actions. Even though there's a history, does that justify his behavior? Bragging, especially when someone is in a vulnerable situation, can be seen as unkind. The fact that he was drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it's not an excuse for hurtful behavior. Also, the author's friends called him an asshole, which adds social judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt justified because of past trauma. It's possible he was seeking some form of closure or validation. However, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, even if they were a bully, is generally frowned upon. It's important to consider empathy here. She's a single mother struggling, and while she was mean before, she's in a tough spot now. The author's response might have been a way to assert his current success, but it came at the expense of her dignity.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how he handled the conversation. Starting to brag after she shared her struggles was insensitive. Even if he needed to \"get it out,\" there might be healthier ways to deal with past resentment without hurting someone else, especially when they're already in a difficult situation. The abruptness of his statement and the lack of consideration for her feelings suggest that he overstepped.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's past experiences provide context, the way he chose to express his feelings in that moment was inappropriate. The pleasure he took in her suffering and the public shaming, even if not intentional, likely made him in the wrong. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
