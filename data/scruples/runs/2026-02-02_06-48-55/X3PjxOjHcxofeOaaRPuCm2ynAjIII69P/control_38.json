HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author, a 27-year-old man, has a high-paying job and an engaged partner. He used to be bullied in high school by a girl named \"Douchebag,\" who was particularly cruel. After years of being bullied, he transformed his life in university, lost weight, got a good degree, and now is doing well. When he meets this girl again, she's a struggling single mother working as a waitress. He brags about his success while she's in a tough spot, even going as far as saying he's glad she's suffering. The friends think he was an asshole, but he feels justified because of her past behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. Even if the woman was unkind in the past, that doesn't give the author the right to mock her current situation. Everyone has the potential to make mistakes or be unkind when they're younger, and people's lives can take different turns. The author's actions seem to be motivated by a desire for revenge or satisfaction at seeing someone he once disliked struggling. \n\nIn social interactions, especially when meeting someone from your past, it's important to maintain empathy and respect. The author took advantage of a situation where the other person was vulnerable, even if she didn't realize her past actions had affected him. The behavior he exhibited\u2014bragging and expressing a lack of sympathy\u2014is generally considered rude and inconsiderate. \n\nThere's also the aspect of being drunk, which might reduce his accountability slightly, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. The friends' reaction suggests that his actions were socially unacceptable. The author's satisfaction in her suffering indicates a desire for vindictiveness rather than a constructive approach to his past pain. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author has a right to feel happy about his own success. But the key issue here is how he communicated that success. Instead of sharing his achievements in a way that could foster mutual respect or offer support, he chose to belittle her situation. \n\nSo, putting this all together, even though the woman was unkind before, the author's response was inappropriate and harmful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
