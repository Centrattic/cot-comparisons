HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, especially given their past. The author used to be bullied by this woman, and now he's successful while she's struggling. He met her again when he was drunk and started bragging about his success, leading to her being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author had a history of being bullied by this woman. Now that he's in a better place, he sees her in a worse situation and uses the opportunity to boast. Even though he might have felt justified, the act of rubbing his success in her face when she's struggling could be seen as cruel.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, it's generally considered unkind to highlight someone's struggles, especially if there's a history of conflict. Even if he was drunk and maybe felt vindicated, the intent to make her feel worse about her situation likely crosses a line. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he felt good because she was suffering. That suggests a desire for some form of schadenfreude, which is typically viewed negatively. While people might have justified feelings based on past experiences, acting on those feelings in a way that harms someone else, even if they've contributed to their own situation, is usually frowned upon.\n\nThe friends' reaction is another point. They called him a \"huge asshole,\" which adds social context. Even if he had reasons, the way he handled the interaction was inappropriate. Bragging and making a derogatory comment like \"I don't feel sorry for you\" is unkind, regardless of past experiences.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he was just venting and that his past made him feel justified. But that doesn't excuse the behavior. People shouldn't take pleasure in others' misfortunes, even if they were previously wronged. The key here is the impact of his actions on her. Even if he had a right to feel some vindication, the way he expressed it was harmful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong because his actions were cruel and took advantage of her vulnerable situation, even if there was a prior history of bullying.\n"
