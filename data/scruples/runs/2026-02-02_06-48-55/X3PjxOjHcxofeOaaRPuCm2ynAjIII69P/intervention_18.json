HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. The situation is a bit complex because the author had a rough high school experience with this girl, who was mean and bullied them. Now, the author is successful and sees the girl in a worse situation, so they decide to brag about their success, making the girl feel upset. The question is whether this action makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was bullied by the girl in the past, but now has a successful life. They encounter the girl in a night out, she's a struggling single mother. The author starts bragging about their six-figure job while the girl is a waitress with two kids. The key moment is when the author says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's having a hard time. The friends call the author an asshole, but the author justifies it as needing to get it out because of past experiences.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So, the analysis should weigh the context against the action. Even though the author was bullied, does that justify rubbing success in someone's face, especially when they are in a vulnerable situation? The author was drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. The intention here is important. The author admits they felt good that the girl was suffering, which shows a lack of empathy. Even if the past treatment was bad, it doesn't mean the person deserves to be mocked. The author is now in a position of power (financially) and uses that to belittle someone else. The girl was trying to be mature and friendly, and the author's response was cruel. \n\nAlso, the author's friends called them out, which might indicate that the action was socially inappropriate. The author's justification that they needed to get the feelings out might be a way to rationalize their behavior. So, despite the past context, the action of bragging and showing schadenfreude is inconsiderate and unkind. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they took advantage of the situation to humiliate someone else, regardless of their history.\n"
