HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a tough time in high school being bullied by a girl, and then later when he succeeds, he meets her again and ends up bragging about his success when she's struggling. The key points here are about whether his actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the author had a bad experience being bullied by this person, so there's that personal history. He turned his life around, which is great, but when he meets her again, he's drunk and starts bragging about his high-paying job while she's a struggling single mother. He even says he's glad she's suffering. The friends called him a huge asshole, but he's conflicted because he feels it's justified.\n\nSo, the ethical question here is about empathy and the appropriateness of his response. Even if he was a victim of her bullying, does that give him the right to mock her when she's in a difficult situation? People can have different perspectives, but generally, rubbing success in someone's face, especially when they're struggling, is considered inconsiderate and cruel. The author might feel vindicated because of past pain, but that doesn't negate the hurtful nature of his words. Also, the fact that he felt good about her suffering is a red flag. It suggests a lack of compassion, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nEven if there's context, the action of intentionally making someone feel worse is wrong. The author chose to share his successes in a way that was clearly meant to highlight her struggles, not to offer support or understanding. The friends' reactions also indicate that his behavior was out of line. \n\nSo, while the author's past is understandable, the way he responded in the moment was harmful. It's important to consider the impact of one's actions on others, regardless of past grievances. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
