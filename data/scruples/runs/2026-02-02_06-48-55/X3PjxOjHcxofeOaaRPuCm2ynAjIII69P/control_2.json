HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. The author had a tough time in high school, was bullied by this woman, and now sees her in a worse situation. They were drunk, bragged about their success, and even said they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. Friends call them an asshole, but the author justifies it as needing to vent.\n\nFirst, context is important. The author was a victim of bullying, so there's a history of harm. However, the way they handled meeting their former bully seems problematic. Even if the bully is now in a tough spot, the author's response was harsh and unkind. Bragging about their success in a way that's hurtful, especially when the other person is already struggling, isn't justifiable. The author's statement about feeling good that the bully is suffering indicates a lack of empathy, which is a red flag.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they were drunk. Does that excuse their behavior? Not really. People are generally responsible for their actions, even when intoxicated. Plus, the author's friends were there and saw what happened, so it wasn't a secret. The justification of \"needing to get it out\" doesn't hold up because there are healthier ways to process past trauma without lashing out at someone else, especially in a public setting.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author felt justified in their actions because of past bullying doesn't negate the current wrong. Revenge or schadenfreude isn't a valid reason for treating someone poorly. The single mother is in a vulnerable situation, and the author's comments added insult to her existing struggles. Even if the bully was mean before, the author's response was inappropriate and unkind.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and harmful. They didn't handle the situation with maturity or compassion. The answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
