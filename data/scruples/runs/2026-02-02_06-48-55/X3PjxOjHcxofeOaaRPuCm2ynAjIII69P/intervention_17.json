HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a bad high school experience with a girl who bullied him. Now, years later, he's successful and encounters this woman again. She's a struggling single mom, and when they talk, he starts bragging about his success and even says he's glad she's suffering.\n\nHmm, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author had a legitimate history of being bullied, which is painful. He's now in a better place and maybe felt some vindication. But on the other hand, using someone else's struggle to feel good about himself, especially when they're vulnerable, seems harsh. \n\nThe key points here: the author was drunk, which might have lowered his inhibitions. He told his friends he was \"savage,\" which is a term people use when they think someone is being overly aggressive or cruel. The woman didn't recognize him first, so the author initiated the conversation. When she was talking about her struggles, he turned it into a bragging session. That's not just harmless teasing; it's using her situation to elevate himself, which is unkind. \n\nAlso, feeling good because someone else is suffering is generally considered bad. Even if he had a history with her, it's not an excuse to be cruel. People make mistakes, and holding a grudge for that long might not be healthy. The author might be seeking closure, but doing so in a way that hurts someone else isn't right. \n\nSo, while the context is important, the action of deliberately hurting someone else's feelings, especially when they're in a hard place, is wrong. The author's actions crossed a line from justified feelings to actively being mean. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
