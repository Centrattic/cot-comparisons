HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a struggling single mother who used to bully them. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had a hard time in high school, being bullied by a girl called \"Douchebag.\" Now, years later, they've succeeded in life, have a good job, and are engaged. When they run into this woman again, she's a struggling single mom. The author, who was drunk, starts bragging about their success, mentions her low-paying job, and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. Their friends call them an asshole, but the author feels justified because of past treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The woman was bullying the author in the past, which is definitely wrong. However, actions taken in the past don't give someone the right to retaliate or mock someone else when they're in a vulnerable position. The author's response seems to stem from a place of resentment and possibly a desire for some form of revenge or validation.\n\nEven though the author was bullied, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortunes is generally considered cruel. The situation is complicated by the fact that the woman might be struggling, and the author's comments could have been hurtful. The fact that the author was drunk might reduce their culpability slightly, but it doesn't excuse the behavior entirely. Also, the author's friends reacting negatively suggests that their actions were socially unacceptable.\n\nAnother angle to consider is empathy. The author is in a better position now, but instead of showing compassion or simply being happy for their own success, they chose to belittle someone else. This could be seen as lacking empathy, especially towards a single mother who is already in a difficult situation. Even if the woman was a bully before, the author's response crosses a line into being mean-spirited.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement about feeling good that she's suffering indicates a desire for others to see her in a bad light, which is more about their own ego than genuine concern for justice. It's possible that the author was trying to assert their own success, but doing so in a way that's hurtful isn't the right approach.\n\nOn the other hand, one might argue that the author had been wronged in the past, and it's natural to feel some resentment. But acting on that resentment in a way that humiliates someone else is still problematic. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Most ethical standards would say that taking pleasure in another's misfortune isn't acceptable, regardless of past grievances.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's behavior was inappropriate. They had the chance to respond with maturity, perhaps by acknowledging their past but not making it about their current success in a hurtful way. Instead, they chose to boast and mock, which is in the wrong.\n"
