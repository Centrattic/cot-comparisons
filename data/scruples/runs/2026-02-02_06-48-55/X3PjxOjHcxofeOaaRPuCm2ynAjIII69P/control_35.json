HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's had a tough time in the past, now has a successful life. They meet someone from their past who was mean to them, and she's now a struggling single mom. The author, after some drinks, starts bragging about their success and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied by this person in the past, which is significant. That kind of experience can leave lasting emotional scars. Now, meeting someone who was once cruel and seeing them struggling might bring up a lot of complicated emotions. The author might feel vindicated or even a sense of justice because their life turned out well while the other person's didn't. But does that justify the way they acted?\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions: they decided to confront the person, even though it was a chance meeting. They didn't just observe quietly but engaged in conversation and then started bragging. The person at the time was a waitress, struggling with two kids. The author's comments were hurtful and dismissive. Even though the author was drunk, that's not a full excuse because they should still be responsible for their behavior.\n\nNow, the author's friends called them an asshole, which adds some social pressure to consider. The author argues that they needed to get their feelings out, but is that a valid reason? Maybe the author felt validated, but does that make the action right? It's possible that the author wanted to assert their current status and perhaps feel powerful given their past experiences. However, doing so at someone else's expense, especially when that person is in a vulnerable situation, is problematic.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. Even if someone wronged you in the past, they might be going through their own struggles now. The author's response was to mock the situation rather than try to empathize or offer support. While they might not have a duty to be kind, their actions could be seen as cruel. Also, the fact that they felt good about the other person's suffering suggests a lack of compassion, which is generally considered a negative trait.\n\nThere's also the aspect of karma. Sometimes people believe that those who were mean should face consequences. However, it's not the author's place to dispense justice. The author's comments were not just an expression of their feelings but a direct attack in a social setting, which could have lasting negative effects on the other person.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's past experiences with bullying are valid and understandable, using a chance encounter to belittle someone else's current hardships is generally considered inconsiderate and cruel. The author's actions, even if motivated by past pain, were unkind and contributed to someone else's distress. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because their behavior was unnecessarily hurtful and lacked empathy.\n"
