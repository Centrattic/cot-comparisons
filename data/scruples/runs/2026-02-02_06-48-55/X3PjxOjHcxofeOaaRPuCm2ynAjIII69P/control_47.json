HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they had a history of being bullied by in high school. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough time with this girl, who was a bully. Now, the author is successful and met her again when she's in a worse position. The key here is the interaction after they meet. He starts bragging about his 6-figure salary and comments on her struggles. He was drunk, but still, the consequences matter.\n\nThe friends called him a huge asshole, which is a social judgment. But the author feels justified because of past experiences. The question is whether his actions were wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been wronged in the past, taking pleasure in their misfortune and displaying it through hurtful comments is generally considered unkind. People often say that holding grudges isn't healthy, and showing compassion is better. Even if the bully is now struggling, the author's response might be seen as vindictive rather than empathetic. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that he \"felt good\" about her suffering suggests a desire to see someone else in a difficult spot, which can be a red flag. While the context of past bullying is important, it doesn't necessarily excuse the current behavior. The situation might have been an opportunity to offer support or at least show some empathy instead of gloating.\n\nHe was drunk, but that's not a full excuse. People are still responsible for their actions when under the influence, even though it might not be intentional. The abruptness and the lack of consideration for her feelings in the moment (she was visibly upset) contribute to the negative judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have had pent-up emotions from years of bullying. But even so, the way he expressed it was harsh. Maybe he could have handled it differently, like not bringing up the comparison or expressing his feelings in a more constructive way.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were unkind and unprofessional, especially since the person he was talking to is in a vulnerable position. Even if there's a history of bullying, the way he reacted was not appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
