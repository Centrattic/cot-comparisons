HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for bragging about their success to a former bully who's struggling as a single mom. The situation has a lot of context, so I need to consider both sides carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl. They worked hard to improve their life, lost weight, got a good degree, and now have a successful career. When they run into the former bully, who seems to be in a worse situation, they start bragging about their success, even saying they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. They were drunk, but that doesn't excuse the behavior entirely.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author might feel justified because of past mistreatment, but the action was to taunt someone else who's struggling. Even if the former bully was a bully, she's now a single mom dealing with her own issues. Bragging in such a situation can be seen as cruel, especially since the woman didn't recognize the author at first and seemed genuinely happy to see them. The author's comments could make her feel worse and might be considered unkind.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which suggests others see it as wrong. The author's justification is that they needed to \"get it out of their system,\" but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Everyone has a right to feel good about their success, but using someone else's hardship to do that is problematic.\n\nSo, even though there's context, the action of gloating over someone's misfortune is generally considered wrong. The author's behavior was harmful and unkind, regardless of past experiences. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
