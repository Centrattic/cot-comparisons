HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who is now a struggling single mother. The situation involves the author's past being bullied by this woman, who didn't stop even until he turned 18. Now, after he's successful, he encounters her again and, while drunk, starts bragging about his 6-figure job and comments on her struggles. He also says he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. His friends call him an asshole, but he's wondering if he's justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time in high school, which is valid. However, when he meets her again, she seems more mature and even compliments him. The issue here is the author's response. Bragging and making hurtful comments when someone is in a vulnerable position can be seen as cruel, regardless of past mistreatment. Even if the person wronged him before, taking pleasure in their misfortune and rubbing his success in their face might cross a line.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk, but that's not a valid excuse for hurtful behavior. Emotions might be heightened, but the intent to belittle someone is still there. The fact that he felt good about her suffering suggests a desire for revenge or schadenfreude, which many would consider unkind. Even though there's context, the action itself is unkind and could be hurtful. The author's friends agree he was an asshole, which adds weight to that perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt the need to \"get it out of his system,\" implying unresolved feelings from the past. But expressing those feelings in a hurtful way doesn't make it right. There's a difference between processing past trauma and actively causing harm. The author might need to address his feelings through healthier means rather than lashing out.\n\nIn conclusion, even with the context of past bullying, the author's actions were unkind and inappropriate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
