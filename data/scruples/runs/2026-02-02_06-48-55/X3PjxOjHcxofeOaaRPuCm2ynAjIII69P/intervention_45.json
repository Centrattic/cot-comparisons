HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (27M) is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, former bully. The situation has a lot of context, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by someone they call \"douchebag.\" They were overweight, had acne, and were mocked. Now, after university, they've succeeded, got a high-paying job, and are engaged. They ran into the former bully, who's a struggling single mom. The author felt compelled to brag about their success, leading to the other person being upset. The author feels justified because of past pain but is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's past trauma, the current situation with the former bully, and the act of bragging during a reunion. The author argues that they needed to \"get it out\" and that the other person's suffering is justified. However, the friends think they're being an asshole.\n\nI need to consider whether the bragging was justified. The author was drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions. But even so, using someone's current hardship to feel better about oneself isn't typically seen as acceptable. The fact that the person was once a bully doesn't necessarily make it okay to mock them now, especially when they're in a vulnerable position. The author might be seeking validation or closure, but the action seems to stem from past hurt, which could be a form of seeking revenge or superiority.\n\nAlso, the author's statement about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering is problematic. Even if the person was a bully before, it's not right to wish others to suffer. The situation might have been an opportunity for empathy rather than spite. The author's friends are right to call it out as mean. The context of their past is important, but that doesn't excuse the current behavior. People should grow and not let past grievances dictate present interactions, especially when it's at the expense of someone else's dignity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a history of being bullied, the way they handled the encounter was inappropriate and hurtful. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
