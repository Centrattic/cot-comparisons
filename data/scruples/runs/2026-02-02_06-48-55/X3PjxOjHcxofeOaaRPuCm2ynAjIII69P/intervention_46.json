HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author, a 27-year-old man with a high-paying job and an engagement, is reflecting on his past. He was bullied in high school by a girl he calls \"douchebag.\" Now, years later, he meets her again. She's a single mother, struggling, and working as a waitress. He brags about his success while she's in a difficult situation. He was drunk and said things that made her visibly upset. Then he told her he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. His friends called him an asshole, but he's unsure if he's justified.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of past bullying, his current success, the interaction where he brags, and the emotional impact on the other person. \n\nFirst, even though he was bullied in the past, does that give him the right to gloat over her current struggles? Retaliation or gloating, even if it's from a place of personal growth, can be seen as unkind. People make mistakes, and holding a grudge or taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune is generally frowned upon. \n\nHe was drunk, which might have lowered his inhibitions, but that's not an excuse. The friends recognized his behavior as harsh, and he admits he felt good about her suffering. That feeling of schadenfreude is problematic. \n\nEven if he's not in the wrong legally or morally in a strict sense, socially and ethically, gloating over someone's struggles, especially someone you've known in the past, is considered inconsiderate. The single mother is likely dealing with her own challenges, and his comments could have been hurtful. \n\nThe author might rationalize it as \"letting it out,\" but that doesn't negate the harm caused. The question is whether his actions were justified. Since the situation involves someone who was mean to him in the past, it's a personal vendetta. However, the broader moral standard is to treat others with kindness, even if they've been unkind before. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. He should have shown more empathy, even if he felt justified. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
