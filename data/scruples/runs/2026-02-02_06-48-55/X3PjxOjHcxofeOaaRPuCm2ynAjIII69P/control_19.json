HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author meeting a former bully, who's now a struggling single mother. The author brags about their success, says they don't feel sorry for her, and feels good that she's suffering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a hard time in high school, being bullied, which ended when they went to university. They've since improved their life. Now, meeting this person who was a bully, the author takes the chance to boast and even says they're glad she's suffering. \n\nThe immediate reaction is that bragging and gloating can be seen as unkind. Even if the person was a bully before, the author is in a position of power now. The woman is a single mother dealing with her own struggles. The author's comments could be hurtful, especially since they mention she was visibly upset. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were drunk. While that might explain some behavior, it doesn't necessarily justify it. People are often held accountable for their actions even if they were under the influence. \n\nThe friends called them a huge asshole, which is a social judgment. The author defends their actions by saying they needed to get it out, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. There's a difference between feeling justified and acting appropriately. \n\nEven if there was a history of being bullied, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune isn't considered a moral response. The author's actions could be seen as petty and cruel. They might have wanted to assert their own success, but the method was inappropriate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong. They crossed a line by gloating and causing someone else to feel upset. Even with context, it's not acceptable to take pleasure in another's suffering.\n"
