HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother. The situation involves past bullying, a chance encounter, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The author was bullied by \"Douchebag\" in the past. Now, they've had a successful life, while the former bully is struggling. The author, after some alcohol, brags about their success and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. The friends call them an asshole, but the author feels justified because of past experiences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions make them the asshole. Let's look at possible angles. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been wronged in the past, taking pleasure in another's misfortune and being cruel when they're vulnerable is generally considered wrong. The author knew the person was struggling, especially with two kids. The bragging and dismissive comments could be seen as insensitive and unkind. The author might feel justified due to past pain, but that doesn't excuse the behavior in the present.\n\nContext matters, but so does empathy. The author had a rough time, but the response was not constructive. Instead of finding closure or showing compassion, they lashed out. Even if they were drunk, they still made a conscious decision to say hurtful things. The friends' reaction supports the idea that the author overstepped.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a defense in the idea of long-term resentment. But society typically values letting go of past grudges and treating others with kindness, even former bullies. The author's actions could be seen as perpetuating the cycle of negativity instead of breaking it.\n\nAlso, the act of confronting someone in a vulnerable state and rubbing success in their face is a common trope in \"Am I the Asshole\" questions, usually leading to the conclusion that the confrontational person is the asshole. The author's satisfaction in the other's suffering is a key point here. It crosses the line from justified closure to unkind behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong. They didn't handle their past trauma constructively and instead acted out in a way that was hurtful. Even if there was a history of bullying, the response was inappropriate and lacked empathy.\n"
