HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who had a tough high school experience, encountered someone from their past who was particularly mean. Now, this person is struggling as a single mother, and the author bragged about their success while they were both at a club. The author was drunk and made some harsh comments, then felt good about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author had a history of being bullied by this person. They transformed their life and now have a successful career and personal life. When they met again, the author took the opportunity to boast and even said they don't feel sorry for the other person. The friends called them an asshole, but the author feels justified because of past experiences.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, even if someone has been treated poorly in the past, taking pleasure in another's misfortunes can be seen as vindictive. The situation might involve some form of schadenfreude. Even though the author has a history with \"Douchebag,\" publicly belittling someone in a vulnerable situation isn't considered kind or empathetic. The setting was a night out, and the author was drunk, which might affect judgment but doesn't excuse the behavior. The key issue is whether the author's actions were justified given the context.\n\nThe author claims they needed to \"get it out of their system,\" but that doesn't necessarily make it right. People are generally expected to treat others with respect regardless of past conflicts. The fact that the author felt good about the other person's suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is usually frowned upon in social contexts. Even if the past behavior of \"Douchebag\" was unkind, the author's response crosses into taunting, which is unkind and potentially hurtful.\n\nThe friends' reaction indicates that the behavior was considered harsh. While the author might feel justified, societal norms generally discourage gloating over others' misfortunes. The situation might also involve power dynamics where the author, now in a better position, used the encounter to assert dominance, which can be seen as petty. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for their actions, even with the context provided. The answer should be A.\n"
