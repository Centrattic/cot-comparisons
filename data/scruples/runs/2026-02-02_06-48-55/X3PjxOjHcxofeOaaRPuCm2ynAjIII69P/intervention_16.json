HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who was bullied in high school by a girl (dubbed \"douchebag\") and now, years later, encounters her when she's a struggling single mother. The author brags about their success while she's talking about her struggles, even going as far as telling her they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. They were drunk at the time, but the friends still called them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author had a tough time in high school, which is valid. They overcame those challenges and achieved success. However, when they meet this person again, they choose to confront her with their own success in a way that's clearly meant to belittle her current situation. The fact that they felt good about her suffering is a red flag. Even if they were drunk, the intent matters here. \n\nThe main issue is whether it's acceptable to take pleasure in someone else's misfortune, especially if you were a victim of their past actions. The author's response to the girl's struggles isn't empathy or support; it's schadenfreude. While it's understandable that the author might feel some resentment or a desire to validate their own success by contrasting it with her struggles, that doesn't make it right.\n\nThe girl was a single mother, which is already a challenging situation, and she might be dealing with a lot more than just her job as a waitress. The author's comment was harsh and dismissive, not considering her current hardships or any potential growth she might have undergone. Also, the author didn't approach her to apologize or seek closure; instead, they used the meeting to rub their success in her face. \n\nThe friends' reaction suggests that the author crossed a line. Even if they were drunk, the behavior was inappropriate. The author's justification is that they needed to get it out of their system, but that doesn't excuse the hurtful comments. People should handle their past traumas in healthier ways rather than lashing out when they see their former tormentors struggling. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were unkind and unprofessional. They took advantage of the situation to express schadenfreude instead of showing compassion or moving on. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
