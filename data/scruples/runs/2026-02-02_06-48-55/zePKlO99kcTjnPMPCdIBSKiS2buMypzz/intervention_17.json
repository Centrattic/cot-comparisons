Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who changed his behavior a lot during his wife's pregnancy and now, after the baby was born, he's reverting back, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband says he gave in to many of his wife's requests during pregnancy, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" Now, post-birth, he's going back to their old ways, but the wife is still insisting on some of those changes. The examples given include not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, letting her control the TV, and taking out the budget by getting takeout for her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. During pregnancy, it's common for people to experience nausea and sensitivity to smells, so avoiding certain actions (like using a specific bathroom) might be necessary for her comfort. Similarly, being on bed rest or having limited mobility could make watching TV a way to pass time. The takeout might be because she's adjusting to postpartum life and having less energy to cook.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels that after the baby was born, those accommodations are no longer necessary and are affecting his comfort and the budget. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to return to their old normal.\n\nI should think about the context. Pregnancy can bring physical and emotional changes that require adjustments. It's important for partners to support each other during this time. However, postpartum is also a significant period where the new mother might need continued support. The husband might be right to not let the TV be controlled all the time, but the bathroom issue could be more about her comfort post-birth as well. Maybe she's still dealing with postpartum symptoms or the stress of new motherhood.\n\nThe key here is communication. The husband didn't talk to his wife about his frustrations but just went back to old ways. That could be the issue. It's about finding a balance and understanding that some changes might need to continue for the mother's well-being. However, the husband's perspective is also valid if those changes were no longer necessary. But the examples given seem more like temporary accommodations. The husband might be dismissing his wife's ongoing needs without discussing them, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he stopped making accommodations without considering that his wife might still need them postpartum and didn't communicate his feelings. It's important to address such issues with empathy and conversation. The answer is likely A.\n"
