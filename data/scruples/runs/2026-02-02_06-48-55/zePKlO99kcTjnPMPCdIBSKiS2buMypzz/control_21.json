Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA letter is in the wrong. The situation is that he went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, and she's still expecting the same accommodations from pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the examples he gave. The first one is not using the upstairs bathroom because the smell was too much for her during pregnancy. He did that, but now he's using it again. The wife is upset because she still wants that. The user's reasoning is that her stool does smell, and he's just dealing with it. Hmm, but maybe during pregnancy, she was more sensitive, and now he's not considering that she might still have some sensitivity or just wants to maintain a routine.\n\nSecond example is about the TV. He let her control it during pregnancy because she couldn't do much else. Now he's taking back control. Maybe she still wants some control after giving birth because she's adjusting to new responsibilities with the baby, so having control over the TV could be a small comfort.\n\nThird issue is the takeout. He was running out for food during pregnancy, which now strains the budget. He stopped, but she's upset. It's about financial concerns versus her needs postpartum. Maybe she's used to not having to go out because of the baby, so she relies on him for that. But he's trying to manage the budget, which is a valid concern.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, when someone is pregnant, partners often make sacrifices to support them. After giving birth, the partner might expect those same considerations to continue, especially if they're recovering or dealing with new motherhood stress. The husband might feel that the temporary changes should be temporary, but the wife might see them as part of their new normal.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's return to old ways is causing harm or disrespect. The examples he gives might seem trivial, but if the wife is still in a vulnerable state postpartum, his actions could be seen as dismissive. For instance, not using the bathroom could be about her comfort, not just smell. Maybe she's dealing with postpartum fatigue and doesn't want to go upstairs. The takeout is about convenience, which might be important if she's managing the baby and has less energy.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to revert to normalcy, which is understandable. He's managing the household and finances. The question is whether his actions are reasonable or if he's being inconsiderate. The wife might feel that her needs are still valid postpartum, especially if she's still recovering.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The husband's reasons are practical, but the wife's expectations might be based on her current situation. If he's not acknowledging her ongoing needs, he could be in the wrong. But if the changes from pregnancy were only necessary during pregnancy, then he's justified in reverting. The line here is whether the adjustments should continue postpartum.\n\nSo, considering that postpartum care is important and the wife might need some support still, the husband's actions could be seen as reverting too quickly without considering her current needs. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced. However, given the examples, the wife's continued insistence might be reasonable, making the husband at fault for not compromising.\n"
