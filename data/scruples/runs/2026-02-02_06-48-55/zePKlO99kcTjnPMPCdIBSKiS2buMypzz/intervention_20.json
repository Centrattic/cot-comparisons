      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about him reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth, while she still expects the changes he made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. During pregnancy, the husband complied with his wife's requests, even some he found ridiculous. After the birth, he's going back to the old ways, but she's upset. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and taking out orders. He's frustrated because these things were temporary accommodations during pregnancy but now seem unreasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze both sides. The husband's perspective is that the accommodations were during pregnancy, a temporary time when she needed support. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, which makes sense. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum issues or emotional needs. Maybe she feels that some changes are necessary for their new family dynamic. \n\nThe example of the bathroom: The smell was a problem during pregnancy, but now he thinks it's just her being sensitive. But maybe postpartum hormones make her more sensitive to smells. Or maybe she's still recovering physically and the smell is still an issue. The TV situation: She had control during pregnancy, now he's taking it back. Maybe she feels like her needs aren't being considered anymore, especially with a newborn. The takeout issue: He's taking over baby duty, so she might not have time to cook, hence relying on takeout. But he's worried about the budget. \n\nThe husband might be right in wanting to return to normal, but he should communicate better with his wife. Maybe he's not considering that some changes are necessary now for the baby's care or their new routine. The wife might still need support, or there's a lack of compromise. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If he's being rigid and not discussing these changes with her, maybe. If he's dismissing her needs postpartum, that's a problem. But if he's trying to reset the household after a temporary period, he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he's handling it\u2014like the bathroom example, where he's being dismissive (\"her shit doesn't stink\")\u2014could be hurtful. \n\nThe key here is communication. Did he talk to her about these changes or just revert? If he didn't discuss it, that's part of the problem. If he did and she's being unreasonable, then it's different. The post doesn't mention communication attempts. But the wife's perspective is that the changes should continue, possibly because they've become habits or she's still adjusting. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' needs. Here, maybe the husband is not entirely in the wrong, but he could be more considerate. However, the way he's framing his actions (like calling her requests ridiculous, being dismissive) might be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's being dismissive and not considering her postpartum needs. Alternatively, B if he's just trying to return to normal. But given the examples, the author's tone is more about frustration and not empathy, which could make him in the wrong. But I'm not sure. The community often looks for mutual understanding, so maybe he's in the wrong for not discussing and being dismissive.\n"
