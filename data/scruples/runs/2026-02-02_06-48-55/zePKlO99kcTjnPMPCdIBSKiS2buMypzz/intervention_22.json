Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The author is a husband who went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, but she's still expecting the same accommodations from her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the wife had specific requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and controlling the TV. The husband complied because he wanted to be supportive during her pregnancy. Now that the baby is born, he's pushing back, thinking those accommodations are no longer necessary.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and adjusting to a new baby. The husband's actions could be seen as a lack of consideration for her continued needs. Even though the smell from the bathroom is normal, the wife might still be sensitive or exhausted. The control of the TV is about her needing rest or distraction after taking care of the baby. For the food, maybe she's not able to go out or cook much, so takeout is a necessity for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is feeling that these accommodations are no longer necessary and are impacting his life, like the budget and his usual routines. He's trying to return to normal, which is understandable. However, the key point is whether the wife's requests are reasonable postpartum. Postpartum can be a challenging time, and wives might need more support. The husband might not be wrong in asking to adjust, but he's approaching it maybe in a dismissive way. For example, calling her poop smell \"insulting\" might be harsh. It's possible he's not considering her ongoing physical and emotional needs. The wife might still need some level of care, especially if she's the one handling baby duties more.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The husband's return to old habits might be causing strain because he's not acknowledging that some accommodations might still be necessary. The wife might need time to adjust, and he's expecting her to return to pre-pregnancy norms. However, the husband also has valid points about the budget and his own needs. The answer might depend on communication. If the husband is abrupt in his change, not discussing with her, then he's in the wrong. If he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. The story doesn't mention communication, so based on the given info, the husband's dismissive attitude towards her ongoing needs might make him at fault. So, AITA? The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, so answer A.\n"
