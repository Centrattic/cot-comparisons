I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband says he gave in to many of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even some he found ridiculous. After the birth, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about boundaries and expectations post-pregnancy. During pregnancy, people often have specific needs due to physical discomforts, like morning sickness or sensitivity to smells. The husband complied then, which is understandable as it's common to accommodate a pregnant partner. Now, the wife might still be adjusting, and perhaps the habits have become routine for her. \n\nThe husband feels that some of these requests are no longer necessary. For example, the bathroom smell: during pregnancy, a sensitive sense of smell is common, but after giving birth, maybe it's not as bad. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can affect physical sensations. The TV control and takeout might be about her needing downtime after childbirth, which is a significant physical and emotional process. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, it's often expected that partners support each other during pregnancy and postpartum. However, the husband is now trying to revert to old habits, which the wife might find frustrating. The question is whether his actions are reasonable. \n\nBut wait, the wife is still in the postpartum period, which can last several months. Her needs might still be valid. The husband might be pushing back too soon, not considering that some accommodations are necessary for her recovery. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom might be about her comfort, not just the smell. Maybe she's still dealing with postpartum fatigue and doesn't want the hassle. \n\nAlso, the takeout issue: running out for food can be a hassle, but after having a baby, especially if they're sleep-deprived, the husband might be trying to share responsibilities. However, the wife might be used to someone else handling it, and the sudden change could cause stress. \n\nBut the husband is also a new parent, possibly feeling overwhelmed, trying to manage the baby and his own needs. It's a balance. The problem here is communication. The husband didn't talk to his wife about his feelings, just decided to go back to old ways. That's a red flag. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. He should have discussed his concerns with her rather than unilaterally stopping the accommodations. His frustration is valid, but the approach might be problematic. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he didn't talk to her and just reverted without considering her ongoing needs, then maybe yes. However, if he's trying to adjust after a long period of giving in, perhaps it's a mutual adjustment period. \n\nI think the main issue is that he's assuming the changes are no longer necessary without considering her perspective. The wife might still need them for her recovery. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because he's not communicating and possibly disregarding her needs postpartum. Answer A.\n"
