I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, complied with her requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now, after the birth, he's going back to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband claims he gave in to her requests during pregnancy out of love and consideration for her condition. Now that the baby is born, he's reverting to normal, but the wife still expects those accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom because of smell, control of the TV, and takeout food. The husband feels these are unreasonable now, especially since the wife's needs during pregnancy were temporary.\n\nThe user wants to know if the husband is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, the husband's actions during pregnancy were probably seen as supportive. Now, postpartum, the wife might be struggling with the sudden change. Maybe she's still dealing with postpartum depression or fatigue, making it hard to adjust back to old routines. The husband's frustration is understandable, but maybe he's not considering her emotional state. \n\nThe examples given: the bathroom smell. Maybe during pregnancy, the smell was more overwhelming due to her sensitivity, but now it's less of an issue. However, the wife might prefer not having to deal with the smell at all, even if it's normal. The TV control could be a power dynamic. The husband might feel he's regaining control, but the wife might feel like her needs aren't being met anymore. \n\nTakeout food is a practical issue. The husband is concerned about the budget, but the wife might have developed a habit or need convenience now that she's managing a newborn. The husband taking over baby watch might mean he's not available to help with other tasks, leading to the wife relying more on takeout.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It depends on perspective. He's trying to return to their pre-pregnancy norms, which is reasonable after the temporary changes. However, maybe he's not considering the wife's current needs or the lingering effects of pregnancy/postpartum. The wife might feel entitled to continue the accommodations because she's still adjusting. \n\nCultural and societal expectations play a role. In some views, the husband's initial compliance was kind, and reverting now is justified. In others, the wife might need continued support. The key is communication. If the husband didn't discuss these changes with his wife, that could be an issue. Maybe she expected the changes to continue as part of adjusting to the new family dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer could be a mix. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's not being considerate of her ongoing needs, then he might be. If he's just returning to normal and she's being unreasonable, then not. But given the examples, it's possible the husband isn't wrong. He made temporary changes, and now they're temporary again. However, if the wife is still struggling, maybe he should be more accommodating. But the question is about the husband's actions. Since he's reverting to his old ways after the temporary period (pregnancy), he's not in the wrong. The wife is being unreasonable in expecting continued changes. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
