Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author going back to old habits after their wife gave birth, and the wife is still expecting some of the changes made during her pregnancy to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he loved his wife and gave in to her requests during pregnancy, even some he found ridiculous, like not using the upstairs bathroom. After the birth, he's trying to return to normal, but the wife still wants those changes. The author feels that some of the requests are unreasonable now, like the bathroom smell, and he's frustrated about the TV and takeout food. The wife is still expecting these accommodations postpartum, which is causing conflict.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: he was accommodating during pregnancy out of love and maybe because he knew she was going through a tough time. Now, the baby has been born, and he feels these accommodations are no longer necessary. He's struggling with balancing his own needs and the new family dynamics. The wife, on the other hand, might be exhausted, dealing with postpartum recovery, and the baby's needs. She might feel that these accommodations help her manage the stress and fatigue, hence why she's still insisting on them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, during pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, which is understandable. Postpartum is a different situation; the wife might have physical and emotional needs that require some of these accommodations. However, the author is now trying to revert to old ways, which the wife is resisting. The key issue here is communication and mutual understanding. If the author hasn't had an open conversation with his wife about his feelings and she hasn't communicated why she still needs those things, then both might be acting out of frustration without full understanding.\n\nBut the author's frustration is valid. The changes during pregnancy were temporary, and expecting them to continue indefinitely without discussion could be unfair. However, the wife might still need some support, especially if she's dealing with postpartum depression or physical recovery. The bathroom smell issue, for example, could be a sensitive topic if she's still dealing with postpartum physical changes that make bathroom odors more distressing. Similarly, the takeout food might be about her needing to conserve energy for the baby, not just convenience.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's returning to his old habits after a temporary period of accommodation. However, he might not be considering his wife's ongoing needs postpartum, which could make it his fault for not being empathetic enough. On the other hand, the wife might be overextending the temporary accommodations without considering the author's perspective.\n\nThe answer depends on the cultural expectations and the specific dynamics of their relationship. In many cases, postpartum care is still a critical period where the mother needs support. The author's actions could be seen as neglecting that support, especially if his wife is struggling. However, if the accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and are no longer needed, then the author has a point.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author communicated his feelings to his wife and whether she is being reasonable. If he's just going back to old ways without discussing it, that's where the problem lies. The author might be in the wrong for not having that conversation, but the situation is complex. The answer might be B (No), because he's not entirely wrong, but it's possible he's not considering his wife's postpartum needs adequately, which could make him at least partially wrong. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that during pregnancy he was accommodating but postpartum is a different scenario, maybe the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here.\n"
