Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth.\n\nFirst, the husband says he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even some he found ridiculous. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to their previous routine, but she's still expecting those accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's perspective. He feels that during pregnancy, he was accommodating her needs, which he now sees as unnecessary postpartum. He's upset that she's still expecting these things, thinking it's unfair. \n\nBut from an external view, pregnancy can involve significant physical and emotional changes. Morning sickness, sensitivity to smells, and fatigue are common. The husband complied during pregnancy, which was compassionate. Now, postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with recovery, lack of energy, or adjusting to new responsibilities with the baby. Her needing some comfort or control over the TV might not be about control but about stress relief or coping mechanisms.\n\nThe husband's frustration is valid\u2014financial strain from takeout and wanting to return to normalcy. However, the transition after childbirth is a major life change. Both partners need to adjust. The husband's approach here is to revert to old ways without considering that his wife might need some adjustments for a while. He might be underestimating her postpartum challenges, which can include depression, anxiety, or physical recovery.\n\nThe husband's tone also comes across as dismissive. Phrases like \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\" show a lack of empathy. Communication is key here. Instead of seeing it as her being unreasonable, he should discuss these changes with her, understanding her perspective and finding compromises. The fact that he wants to take over baby duty but also expects her to adjust might be causing the tension. They might need to find a balanced approach that considers both their needs.\n\nIn summary, while the husband's frustrations are real, his approach lacks empathy and communication. He's in the wrong for not considering his wife's ongoing needs postpartum and not addressing them through dialogue. The answer should be A.\n"
