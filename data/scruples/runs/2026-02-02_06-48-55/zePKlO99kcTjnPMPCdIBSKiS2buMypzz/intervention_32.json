Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a husband, made a lot of accommodations for his wife during her pregnancy. Now, after she gave birth, he's going back to his old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. He's upset about things like not using the upstairs bathroom, her controlling the TV, and him having to get takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical discomfort, like nausea or sensitivity to smells. The husband complied with her requests out of consideration for her well-being. After birth, he feels like those accommodations aren't necessary anymore. But she's still expecting them, maybe because she's dealing with postpartum challenges or hasn't fully recovered yet.\n\nThe key issue is communication. Did the husband talk to his wife about why he's reverting to old habits? If he just stopped without discussing it, that could be the problem. Relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. Maybe the wife is still dealing with postpartum depression or stress, making her cling to the previous adjustments for comfort. The husband's frustration is understandable, but he needs to approach this with empathy and find a middle ground.\n\nLooking at his examples: the bathroom issue. He says she couldn't handle the smell during pregnancy, which is common. Now he finds it insulting. But maybe she's still sensitive? Or perhaps she's just used to the routine. The TV control might be about her needing downtime after childbirth, which is significant. The takeout is a budget concern, but maybe she's not used to managing without it yet.\n\nThe husband's approach seems to be about his own comfort now, without considering her possible ongoing needs. That could be why the wife is upset. He might be in the wrong if he's not communicating and being considerate. However, if the wife isn't listening to his concerns either, then it's a two-way issue. But the question is about the author's fault. Since he's the one changing behaviors without discussion, he might be at fault. So, answer A.\n"
