Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" Now that the baby is born, he's reverting to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that he was accommodating during pregnancy because he loved his wife and wanted to support her. Now that she's no longer pregnant, he feels it's reasonable to go back to their previous routines. He gives examples like not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and takeout food. He finds it insulting and a financial burden now.\n\nThe wife's perspective, as inferred, is that she still expects those accommodations to continue. Maybe she's dealing with postpartum issues or still feels the need for those adjustments for her well-being or the baby's. The author is frustrated because he feels the reasons for the changes no longer apply.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks he is, but I need to verify. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. If the author didn't discuss these changes with his wife after the baby was born, he might be missing her needs. For example, the bathroom issue might not be about smell but about her comfort or avoiding stress. The TV control could be her way of coping with the new responsibilities. Food might relate to her energy levels or the demands of caring for a newborn.\n\nHowever, the author is also responsible for their financial situation. Maybe the takeout is a point where they need to find a compromise. The author's frustration is valid if the changes are no longer necessary. But if the wife is still relying on those habits for her mental health or physical well-being, reverting suddenly could be stressful for her.\n\nThe key factors are: Did the author communicate with his wife about these changes post-birth? Are there medical or health reasons that still require some accommodations? Is the author considering her perspective, or is he just dismissing her needs post-pregnancy?\n\nIf the author didn't check in with her and just went back to old habits without understanding her current needs, he might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if those accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and she's not experiencing the same issues now, the author has a point. But since the wife is still insisting, there might be valid reasons she hasn't communicated clearly.\n\nIn most cases, relationships require flexibility and understanding. The author might be prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's needs, which can be seen as selfish. However, if the wife isn't considering the financial impact or the author's contributions, she might be at fault too. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nGiven the information, the author's actions could be seen as dismissive of his wife's ongoing needs. He might not have considered that some adjustments are necessary beyond pregnancy, especially with a newborn. The answer hinges on whether the author communicated and if the wife's requests are legitimate. Since the author didn't mention discussing this with her, he might be in the wrong for not addressing it collaboratively. Therefore, the answer is A (he is in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Maybe the author is justified if the accommodations are no longer necessary. However, without communication, assuming the worst and reverting without considering her current situation could be the issue.\n"
