Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The original post is from a husband who's feeling like he gave in to his wife's demands during pregnancy but now wants to go back to normal after the birth. The wife is still expecting those accommodations post-birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to adjust their behavior to support the pregnant person, even if some requests seem trivial. The husband did that, which shows consideration. Now, after the baby's birth, he's trying to revert, which is understandable, but the wife might still need some adjustments, especially if she's dealing with postpartum recovery, sleep deprivation, and caring for a newborn.\n\nLooking at the examples: not using the upstairs bathroom because of smell. During pregnancy, maybe the smell was more sensitive due to nausea or hormonal changes. Postpartum, she might still be dealing with fatigue or stress, making the smell bothersome. The husband's frustration is real, but it's important to recognize that her needs might be different now, perhaps due to ongoing physical or emotional recovery.\n\nControl of the TV: Letting her watch shows during pregnancy because she had limited mobility. Now, with a newborn, she might not have time to wind down, so TV could be her only relaxation. The husband taking over the TV time could add stress. But he's also managing baby duty, which is a valid point.\n\nTakeout food: During pregnancy, the wife might have had specific cravings or lack of appetite. Now, post-birth, she might be dealing with postpartum fatigue, making cooking difficult. The husband's concern about the budget is valid, but the wife's needs might still require some flexibility.\n\nThe key here is balancing empathy with practicality. The husband's return to old ways might seem abrupt to the wife, who's still adjusting to motherhood. He needs to communicate his feelings without dismissing her needs. Maybe finding a middle ground, like setting boundaries on takeout while still allowing some flexibility, or discussing TV time to ensure both get rest.\n\nIs he in the wrong? He's not entirely wrong because he's trying to balance his own needs. However, his approach might come off as dismissive of his wife's postpartum challenges. The wife might need more support during this time. So the answer might lean towards him not being completely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication and compromise.\n"
