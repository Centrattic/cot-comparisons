Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about returning to old habits after his wife gave birth. He mentions that during her pregnancy, he made a lot of accommodations, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her have control of the TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to the old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. He's frustrated because things like the bathroom smell and the TV control are still being enforced, and he's also upset about the takeout budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband argues that during pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, which he found ridiculous, but he did it out of love. Now that the baby is here, he's trying to return to normal, but she's not letting go of those changes. He feels it's insulting and unfair, especially with the bathroom smell and takeout costs.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, hormonal changes, and the stress of a new baby. She might have developed certain habits for her comfort and well-being, and the sudden change could be causing her stress or discomfort. The bathroom issue during pregnancy was due to her nausea, and maybe she's still sensitive to smells. The TV control could be because she's tired and wants to relax, especially with a newborn. The takeout might be because she's not able to cook much right now.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband's frustration is valid because he's adjusting back to his routine, but he needs to consider his wife's well-being. However, she might also need to recognize that some accommodations were temporary. The question is whether he's reverting too quickly or if she's being unreasonable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. If the husband is being dismissive of her needs now that she's postpartum, he's in the wrong. But if his wife is holding onto temporary measures without considering the husband's perspective, then she's at fault. However, the husband's examples (like bathroom smell, TV control, takeout) might have been temporary during pregnancy. Now that it's over, expecting to return to normal is reasonable. The wife might need to adjust, but the husband should approach this with empathy, discussing the changes rather than just reverting. Maybe he didn't communicate his feelings properly. The answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong because the accommodations were for a temporary period, but it's a close call. Alternatively, if the wife is still in a vulnerable state, the husband's actions could be seen as insensitive. Considering all this, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because he's adjusting back to normal after a temporary period, but he should have communicated better. However, the wife's needs postpartum might still be significant. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A (Yes) if the husband's actions are dismissive of his wife's ongoing needs, but if the accommodations were only needed during pregnancy, then B. It's a bit tricky. The husband's frustration is understandable, but he should approach it with care. The answer likely is B because the changes were temporary, but the way he's handling it might need adjustment. So, the author is not in the wrong, answer B.\n"
