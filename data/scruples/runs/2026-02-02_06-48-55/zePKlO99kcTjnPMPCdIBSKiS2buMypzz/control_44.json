Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author adjusting their behavior after their wife gave birth, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, during the pregnancy, the wife had specific requests\u2014like not using the upstairs bathroom and having control of the TV. The author complied, which is understandable given the context of pregnancy-related discomforts. Now, post-birth, the author is reverting to old habits, but the wife still expects the changes to continue. The author feels that things like bathroom use and TV control are now unreasonable, and the takeout expenses hurt the budget.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and expectations. When someone is pregnant, they might have temporary needs or preferences that their partner accommodates out of care and support. After the birth, those temporary accommodations might no longer be necessary, and it's reasonable for the author to reassess. However, the wife might still be experiencing postpartum challenges and could be relying on those changes for her comfort or mental health.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid, especially regarding financial strain from takeout. It's important to communicate these concerns to the wife. However, the author should also consider that the wife might still be adjusting to motherhood and might need continued support, even if the immediate pregnancy symptoms have passed. The question is whether the author's actions are unreasonable or dismissive of the wife's ongoing needs.\n\nThe tone of the author's post shows some frustration but also a willingness to explain their perspective. The wife's insistence on continuing the changes might stem from a need for consistency or coping mechanisms during a stressful period. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to return to normalcy, but it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and open dialogue. The answer likely hinges on whether the author is acknowledging the wife's perspective while asserting their own needs.\n"
