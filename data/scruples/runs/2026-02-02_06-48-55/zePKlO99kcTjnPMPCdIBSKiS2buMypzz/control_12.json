I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband changed his behavior during his wife's pregnancy, accommodating her requests even if they seemed unreasonable. After the baby was born, he's trying to return to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those accommodations. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband gave into various requests during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her control the TV. Now, postpartum, he's refusing to continue these things. The wife, however, is still insisting on them. The husband feels this is unfair, especially with the added financial strain from takeout.\n\nI should think about the context. Pregnancy can cause physical discomfort and nausea, which might explain why the husband didn't use the upstairs bathroom. But after giving birth, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum issues or stress, making it hard for her to adjust back. The husband's frustration is understandable, especially regarding the financial aspect and the bathroom issue. However, the wife might feel that these accommodations were necessary for her well-being during and after pregnancy.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key here is whether his return to old habits is reasonable or if he should continue accommodating her postpartum. Postpartum can be a challenging time for new mothers, both physically and emotionally. The wife might need more support, even beyond pregnancy. The husband might feel that his sacrifices were only temporary, but the wife could see them as necessary for her comfort during a vulnerable period.\n\nI need to evaluate if there's a balance between mutual respect and personal boundaries. The husband has the right to his own comfort and financial responsibility, but the wife's needs postpartum are also valid. It's possible that communication is lacking here. Maybe the husband didn't discuss his feelings with the wife before acting, leading to her feeling unsupported. Alternatively, the wife might not be considering the husband's perspective on financial strain and personal space.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for partners to make temporary adjustments during pregnancy. However, postpartum care can be more complex. There's no clear right or wrong, but the husband's actions might be seen as dismissive of his wife's ongoing needs if she's still struggling. On the other hand, if the wife is now being unreasonable, expecting continued concessions without considering the husband's position, that could be an issue.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband's return to old ways is abrupt without considering his wife's ongoing situation. If he's not communicating and is being dismissive, he might be in the wrong. If the wife is still experiencing legitimate postpartum issues that require those accommodations, then the husband's refusal could be seen as insensitive. However, if the wife is unnecessarily holding onto these requests without acknowledging the husband's feelings and the practical aspects (like finances), then the husband might be in the right.\n\nI think the key is the communication and the reasonableness of the wife's continued demands. If she's still having valid reasons (like postpartum depression affecting her sensitivity to smells or stress making her rely on certain habits), then the husband's actions might be insensitive. But if the wife is just being difficult without justification, the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if the husband's actions are justified given the context.\n"
