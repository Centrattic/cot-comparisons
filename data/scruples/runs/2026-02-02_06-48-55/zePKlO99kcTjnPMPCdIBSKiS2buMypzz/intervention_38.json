Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after their wife gave birth, and the wife is still expecting the same accommodations they had during pregnancy. The author is frustrated with things like using the upstairs bathroom, letting her have control of the TV, and taking out for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the author made accommodations which they found reasonable at the time because the wife was pregnant and dealing with sickness. Now that the baby is born, the author is reverting to normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes. The author feels it's unfair now.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, maybe the author is right to want to return to their usual habits, especially since the wife's physical condition has changed. During pregnancy, certain accommodations are necessary for health reasons. However, the wife might still be adjusting postpartum, both physically and emotionally. The author's frustration with the budget and household responsibilities is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's tone is a bit dismissive. Phrases like \"her shit doesn't stink\" and \"trashy reality shows\" might come across as disrespectful. The wife's needs postpartum can be different; she might still be dealing with recovery, lack of sleep, and caring for a newborn. The author taking over baby watch is a positive step, but the financial strain is a valid concern.\n\nThe key issue is communication. The author should have discussed the changes gradually rather than abruptly reverting. It's possible that the wife feels unsupported now, which could affect their relationship. The author's actions might seem selfish if they don't consider her ongoing needs post-birth. However, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the circumstances have changed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they need to approach the situation with empathy. They should communicate better and find a middle ground. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
