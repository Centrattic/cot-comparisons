      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband talking about his wife. During her pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" Now that their daughter was born in October, he's trying to return to their old normal, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, which he found insulting now since she's just giving in to that. Also, she controlled the TV during pregnancy, watching reality shows, and the author allowed that. Now, post-birth, he's expected to still let her have that control. Food is another issue where the wife got used to takeout, which is hurting the budget, and he doesn't want to do it anymore. He feels he should be in charge of baby watch when he gets home and not have to get her a burger.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key points. The husband made accommodations during pregnancy, which is common and often expected. But now, after the baby is born, he's reverting to his old habits and the wife is still expecting the accommodations. He feels the wife's current needs are unreasonable. The examples given are about bathroom use, TV control, and takeout. \n\nI need to consider the context. Pregnancy can bring physical and emotional changes that make certain things uncomfortable for the mother. For instance, nausea might make smells more sensitive, so not using the upstairs bathroom could be a reasonable request during pregnancy. However, postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with the aftermath of pregnancy and childbirth, including possible hormonal changes, fatigue, or stress related to caring for a newborn. \n\nThe bathroom issue: The husband is now upset because he uses the upstairs bathroom. The wife might have had a medical reason for the smell being a problem during pregnancy, but after giving birth, maybe the issue is different. However, the husband's reaction seems dismissive, using phrases like \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does.\" That's a bit rude and could be seen as invalidating his wife's feelings. Even if the smell is normal, the way he's framing it as an insult suggests he's not considering her perspective. Postpartum, women might still have a lower threshold for certain smells due to lingering nausea or other health issues. The husband's willingness to \"just deal with it\" might not be fair, especially if it's causing her discomfort.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, the wife controlled the TV because she couldn't go out much. Now, postpartum, maybe she's still dealing with postpartum depression, anxiety, or just needs time to relax after caring for the baby. The husband is frustrated because he wants to take it back, but the wife might still need that space. However, the husband's reasoning that she can't go out \"so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants\" during pregnancy makes it sound like he gave in out of obligation rather than genuine consideration. If he resents it now, that's a problem. But maybe the wife is still more tired and needs the TV as a coping mechanism.\n\nTakeout: The husband is concerned about the budget. That's a valid point, but he also mentions that he's taking over baby watch when he gets home. So, maybe he's working and the wife is at home, leading to different responsibilities. If she's staying home, maybe she's not contributing to the income, so the husband feels the takeout is unfair. However, postpartum, the wife might be dealing with a lot of stress and the takeout is a small way to help her. The husband is now bringing up the budget, but perhaps there's a balance needed here. It's also possible that the wife didn't realize the financial impact and is now adjusting to her new role as a mother, which is more demanding.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author might have made these accommodations without really discussing them with his wife, assuming they were temporary. But if the wife expected them to continue postpartum, there might be a disconnect. The husband's frustration is understandable, but his approach seems dismissive. For example, the bathroom comment comes off as mocking. Instead of reverting to old habits abruptly, maybe he should have discussed it with her. The wife might also be in a vulnerable state postpartum and not have the emotional bandwidth to negotiate these changes right away. But if she's insisting on them, perhaps there's a valid reason she's not sharing, or maybe she's still adjusting to the new normal.\n\nAnother angle: The husband's actions during pregnancy were likely well-intentioned, as he wanted to be supportive. However, now that the baby is here, both partners need to adjust their needs. The husband might not be considering that the wife might still need some level of care and support postpartum. On the other hand, the wife might be overstepping by expecting the same accommodations as during pregnancy. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a balance. The husband's right to return to his previous habits versus the wife's possible need for continued support. The way he's phrased it, especially the bathroom part, seems a bit harsh. He's implying that the wife is being unreasonable and that he's being insulted. But if she's still dealing with postpartum issues (like exhaustion, or even temporary medical conditions), those accommodations might still be necessary. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not considering the wife's current needs and is dismissive of her requests. However, if the wife is being insistent without valid reasons, the husband has a right to set boundaries. The answer likely depends on the wife's current state and the husband's willingness to communicate and understand her perspective. Since the husband didn't mention discussing these changes with his wife, just that he's reverting and she's insisting, he might be at fault for not addressing the issue properly. But the wife could also be overstepping if she's not considering the budget and other changes. However, given the power dynamic in relationships and the potential for postpartum stress, the husband's abrupt return to old ways without discussion might be the problem. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's being dismissive and not considering that his wife might still need some support postpartum. His examples of \"ridiculous\" requests during pregnancy but now expecting her to handle them without discussion is a red flag. AITA often sides with the person who is trying to be considerate and communicate, while the other person isn't. Here, the husband is acting out without addressing the underlying issues, which is unkind and potentially harmful to their relationship. So the answer would be A.\n"
