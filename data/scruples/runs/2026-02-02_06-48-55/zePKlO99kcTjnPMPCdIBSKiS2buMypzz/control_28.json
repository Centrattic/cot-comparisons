Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author changing back to old habits after their wife gave birth, which is causing some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the scenario. The author mentions that during their wife's pregnancy, they gave in to many of her requests, even if they seemed unreasonable. After the birth, they're reverting to their previous behaviors, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. Specific examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout which affects the budget.\n\nNow, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can bring physical and emotional changes, which might explain why the wife had certain requests during that time. For instance, sensitivity to smells is common during pregnancy. The author complied then, which shows they were accommodating. However, after childbirth, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which could affect her well-being. The author's frustration seems to stem from feeling that they're doing too much now, especially with taking care of the baby and not wanting to continue the takeout routine.\n\nI should think about the balance of compromise in a relationship. The author gave in during pregnancy out of consideration for the wife's health and comfort. Postpartum is a delicate time, and the wife might still need support. However, the author is now trying to reset boundaries, which is understandable since the circumstances have changed. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nAnother angle is the takeout issue. The author feels it's hurting the budget. It's possible the wife isn't aware of the financial impact. Open communication is key here. Maybe the author hasn't discussed this with the wife yet. The bathroom issue might be about the wife's continued sensitivity or maybe she just wants the author to be considerate. The TV control seems more about routine now, but the author is pushing back.\n\nI also need to consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, it's expected for the partner to continue certain accommodations post-pregnancy. However, relationships require mutual adjustment. If the wife is still struggling with postpartum issues, the author might need to continue some support. But if those requests are no longer necessary, the author has a right to revert.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the changed circumstances. The author is trying to balance their own needs with their wife's, which is normal. However, they might need to communicate better with their wife about the changes and find a middle ground. If the wife's requests are still valid (like sensitivity to smells), then the author should comply. If not, reverting to old ways is justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the situation has changed post-birth, but they need to communicate better with their wife. However, if the wife still has valid reasons for some of the requests, the author might need to adjust. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the requests are still valid. The examples given (bathroom smell, TV control, takeout) might not have the same validity post-birth, so the author's pushback is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
