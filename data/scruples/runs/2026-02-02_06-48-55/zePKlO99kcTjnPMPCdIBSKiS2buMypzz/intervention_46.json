Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he made several accommodations, like avoiding the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to how things were, but she's still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, the author made these changes out of respect for her needs, which is understandable. Pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging, so accommodating her requests shows he cares. Now, postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with physical recovery or adjusting to motherhood, which could explain why she's holding onto those changes. It's possible she's not just being stubborn but might have legitimate reasons, like ongoing sensitivity to smells or stress that makes controlling the TV a comfort.\n\nThe author feels that the changes were temporary and that it's unreasonable to continue them. However, the key point here is communication. Did he and his wife discuss these expectations before the baby was born? If they didn't set clear boundaries about what would change postpartum, it's natural for misunderstandings to arise. The author's frustration is valid if these habits are affecting his quality of life, but his approach might come across as dismissive of his wife's ongoing needs.\n\nLooking at the examples: avoiding the upstairs bathroom because of smell. Even if it's true that bodily functions have odors, during pregnancy, this could have been a way to avoid triggering her nausea. Postpartum, she might still have a heightened sensitivity or be dealing with postpartum recovery, making the smell more bothersome. It's not just about the smell but about her comfort and recovery. Similarly, the TV control and takeout could be about her needing downtime to cope with the new baby's demands.\n\nThe author wants to revert to normal but might not be considering that the postpartum period is a different phase. The wife's continued insistence might not be about control but about adjusting to a new normal where those habits helped her cope. The author's frustration is real, but the issue is whether he's respecting her ongoing needs. Without communication, it's hard to say, but the wife might feel that her needs are still valid, especially if she's experiencing postpartum challenges.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a balance between the author's needs and his wife's. If the author hasn't communicated his feelings and is abruptly reverting without considering her perspective, that could be where he's at fault. However, if the wife is being unreasonable beyond what's necessary, the author might have a point. But given the context, it seems the wife's continued requests are about her adjusting to motherhood, which is a significant life change. The author's responsibility is to communicate his feelings and find a middle ground rather than assuming the changes are no longer necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if he's not engaging in open dialogue and is dismissing his wife's ongoing needs without understanding the reasons behind them. The answer could be A, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the wife is being overly controlling, then B. But the examples given don't suggest control; they suggest coping mechanisms. Therefore, the author hasn't handled it well, so A might be correct.\n"
