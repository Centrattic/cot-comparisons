Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a husband, made a lot of accommodations during his wife's pregnancy, like avoiding the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to return to normal, but the wife still expects those changes. The author feels like she's being unreasonable now, especially since the smell of the bathroom is normal and she's still asking for takeout which affects the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and sensitivity can make certain smells more intense, so the husband adjusting the bathroom use was a common accommodation. Postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with physical or emotional changes, perhaps fatigue or adjusting to motherhood. The husband is trying to balance his own needs, like not wanting to go out for takeout anymore, but the wife might still feel dependent or have lingering health issues.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband's frustration is understandable, but his phrasing might come off as dismissive. For example, saying \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\" is sarcastic and might be seen as disrespectful. That could hurt his wife's feelings, making her feel like her concerns aren't valid anymore. Also, expecting her to adjust suddenly without considering her perspective might be part of the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband has valid points about the budget and his own comfort. It's important to find a middle ground. The question is if he's wrong for wanting to return to their old ways. Maybe the issue is more about how he's approaching it rather than the desire to return to normal. If he's not communicating effectively, that's a problem. Being in the wrong would depend on whether he's being dismissive of her needs postpartum. If she's still struggling, maybe some accommodations should continue, but if they're unnecessary, he's justified. However, the tone and approach matter a lot here. The husband might not be wrong in his intentions but could be wrong in his execution, like the sarcastic comments. So the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but he needs to communicate better. Alternatively, if the wife's needs are still legitimate, he might be in the wrong (A) to some extent. It's a bit nuanced. The community's usual take on AITA posts often values empathy and communication. The husband's sarcasm is a red flag, so maybe he's in the wrong (A) for that, but the core issue is mutual adjustment. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, he's not wrong, but needs to handle it better. But the question is asking if he's in the wrong, not if he's handling it well. The line between being wrong and needing better communication is thin here. I think the answer is B, because returning to normal is reasonable, but the way he's doing it could be improved. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong, so maybe AITA communities often consider the tone and if they're being unkind. His comments are a bit rude, which might make him in the wrong. So maybe A. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check similar situations. If someone's being dismissive of a partner's postpartum needs, that's problematic. But if the accommodations were during pregnancy and not necessarily needed postpartum, maybe the husband is right. The wife might need some time adjusting, but if she's still insisting on unreasonable things, the husband has a right to push back. However, the husband's approach is important. If he's being disrespectful, that's his fault. So the answer is A (wrong) because of the tone and dismissiveness, even if the desire to return to normal is understandable. The key is the way he's expressing it, which is unkind.\n"
