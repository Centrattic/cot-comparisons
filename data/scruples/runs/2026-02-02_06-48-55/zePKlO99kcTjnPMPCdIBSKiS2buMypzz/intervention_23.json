I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went back to his old habits after his wife gave birth, but she's still expecting the changes he made during her pregnancy. The husband feels like he's being unreasonable, especially with things like using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to adjust their behavior to accommodate the pregnant person's needs, which can be physical or emotional. The husband made these changes out of love and to support his wife, which is understandable. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, but the wife is still expecting those same accommodations. \n\nThe key points are whether the husband is justified in reverting to old ways or if he's being dismissive of his wife's needs postpartum. Postpartum is a time when new mothers might still have physical and emotional challenges. The wife might be dealing with recovery, sleep deprivation, and hormonal changes. The husband's complaints about the bathroom smell or TV control could be seen as trivializing her experiences, but maybe he's also trying to balance the household and his own needs.\n\nLooking at the examples: the bathroom issue. During pregnancy, the wife was sensitive to smells, so he avoided using the upstairs bathroom. Now, postpartum, maybe she's still sensitive, or maybe it's a different issue. The husband finds it insulting, but the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can include nausea or other physical symptoms. The husband's comment about the smell being \"insulting\" might come across as dismissive of her health.\n\nTV control: during pregnancy, he let her watch shows because she had limited mobility or energy. Now, after giving birth, she might still be dealing with exhaustion and the demands of a newborn. Taking the TV might add to her stress. The husband's perspective is that he's tired of giving it up, but maybe she still needs that downtime.\n\nTakeout food: he's concerned about the budget. Postpartum, new mothers often need extra care, and the husband's willingness to take out food might have been a way to support her nutrition and reduce her stress. Now he's pulling back, which could lead to her not being properly nourished, adding to her postpartum stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to return to a normal routine, which is also important for his well-being. The question is whether his actions are inconsiderate or if they're just adjusting back to pre-pregnancy life. The wife might still need support during postpartum, which is a significant time of adjustment for both parents.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Considering that postpartum support is crucial, and the husband might be reverting too quickly without considering his wife's ongoing needs, the answer might lean towards A. However, if the wife is being unreasonable about changes that are no longer medically necessary, then B could be the case. But the examples given suggest that the wife's needs during pregnancy were valid, and postpartum might still require some accommodations. The husband's dismissal of her needs could be seen as inconsiderate, hence A. But I need to be careful not to assume too much about the wife's current state. The key is whether the husband is being dismissive of her postpartum challenges. The husband's tone in the examples seems to mock her needs, which could be hurtful. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
