I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now that their daughter was born, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but his wife still expects those changes to continue. Examples given are not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout. The author feels that these things are no longer necessary and are a burden, especially the takeout affecting the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of pregnancy and postpartum. During pregnancy, many women experience physical and emotional changes that can affect their comfort. For example, nausea or sensitivity to smells is common during pregnancy. The author gave in to avoid conflict and to support his wife during that time, which seems reasonable. However, after childbirth, the situation might have changed. The author is trying to return to normal, but his wife is still expecting those accommodations. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing these changes. Let's break down the examples:\n\n1. **Upstairs bathroom**: The wife was sensitive to the smell during pregnancy. Now that she's postpartum, maybe her sensitivity has lessened. The author feels it's insulting that she still wants that restriction. Is the smell an issue? The author says it's normal, but the wife might still be sensitive. However, the author is now trying to use the bathroom normally, which is part of their home. The wife's continued request could be seen as unreasonable if her sensitivity has subsided, but maybe she still has lingering issues. \n\n2. **TV control**: During pregnancy, the author let her watch TV because she couldn't do much else. Now, with a newborn, the dynamics have changed. The author might feel that the TV control should be shared again. However, new parents often have different stress levels and may need different things. The wife might still need some downtime with TV after caring for the baby. \n\n3. **Takeout**: The author is concerned about the budget. During pregnancy, he was accommodating, but now it's affecting their finances. However, postpartum, the wife might have physical or emotional needs that require specific foods, especially if she's nursing. Refusing takeout could be seen as not supporting her recovery or the baby's needs. \n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions might seem reasonable if the wife's needs have decreased. However, the postpartum period is a critical time for both parents. The wife might still be adjusting, dealing with sleep deprivation, and possibly hormonal changes. The author's reversion to old habits without considering her ongoing needs could be seen as insensitive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions taking over baby watch when he gets home. That's a positive step, but expecting the wife to handle all the takeout might add to her stress. Communication is key here. The author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to find a balance, but if he's dismissing her needs without understanding, that could be problematic. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, mutual support is important. If the wife is still in a vulnerable state postpartum, the author's refusal to continue some accommodations might be seen as not supporting her. However, if those accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and aren't essential now, the author's stance could be reasonable. \n\nBut given that the wife is still insisting on the changes, there might be an underlying issue. Perhaps she's struggling with the transition to motherhood and needs more support. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her perspective and the possible ongoing needs from the postpartum period. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is understandable, the postpartum period is a time when support is crucial. If the wife is still dealing with physical or emotional challenges, continuing some accommodations could be necessary. The author might need to communicate better with his wife rather than just reverting to old ways. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong (A).\n"
