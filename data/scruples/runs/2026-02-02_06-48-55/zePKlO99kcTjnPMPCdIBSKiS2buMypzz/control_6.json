She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe user is a husband who had to make a lot of accommodations during his wife's pregnancy. Now that their daughter was born, he's going back to the old ways, but his wife is still insisting on those changes. Examples given are not using the upstairs bathroom because she found the smell too much during pregnancy, letting her control the TV, and her relying on takeout which is hurting the budget. The husband feels that these things are no longer necessary and that he shouldn't have to continue them, especially since he's taking over baby duties when he gets home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make sacrifices to support the pregnant person, even if some requests seem unreasonable. The husband did that, which shows consideration. Now, after the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to revert to their previous habits. Let's break down each example:\n\n1. **Upstairs Bathroom**: The wife was told not to use it during pregnancy due to smell sensitivity. Now, postpartum, she might still be sensitive, or maybe she's just reluctant to change. The husband finds it insulting that she's still not using it, implying she's being unreasonable. But postpartum, some sensitivities might linger, or maybe there's a different reason (like hygiene after giving birth). The husband's comment about the smell being normal might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\n2. **TV Control**: Allowing her to watch reality shows during pregnancy was a concession. Now that the baby is born, maybe she still wants to relax, but the husband feels it's no longer necessary. However, being a new parent is stressful, and having some personal time might still be important for her. The husband not allowing that could be seen as not recognizing her ongoing needs.\n\n3. **Takeout and Budget**: The wife got used to takeout during pregnancy. Now, the husband is concerned about the budget. It's valid to want to adjust spending post-pregnancy, but the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and baby needs, making it harder for her to manage. The husband taking over baby watch when he gets home might mean the wife is handling other tasks, and takeout could be a way to manage that.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to return to normal and is frustrated that the wife is still insisting on changes that were only necessary during pregnancy. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum challenges, such as physical discomfort, emotional stress, or adjusting to motherhood. Her requests could be a way to cope or a habit formed during a time when she needed more support. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the way he's framing the issues (e.g., calling the smell \"insulting,\" suggesting she's being unreasonable) might come across as dismissive of her needs.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's being reasonable in adjusting his behavior post-pregnancy and communicating his concerns, then maybe not. But if he's being dismissive and not considering his wife's ongoing needs, especially in the postpartum period which can be a vulnerable time, then he might be in the wrong. The husband's tone in the examples suggests irritation rather than empathy, which could contribute to the issue. The wife might feel that her needs are still valid, and the husband is not acknowledging that.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect is a practical concern. The husband is right to be mindful of the budget, but it's a matter of finding a balance between supporting his wife and managing their finances. Communication is key here. If the husband approached the wife with his concerns and discussed solutions together, that would be better than just reverting to old ways without discussion.\n\nIn summary, while the husband has valid points about returning to normal and budget concerns, his approach might be dismissive of his wife's postpartum needs. The wife's insistence could be due to lingering physical or emotional issues. The answer would depend on whether the husband is being considerate and communicating effectively. If he's just going back without discussing, he might be in the wrong. If he's trying to adjust but the wife is being unreasonable, it's different. But given the way he's phrased it (e.g., \"it's insulting,\" \"her shit doesn't stink\"), he might be in the wrong for not showing empathy.\n"
