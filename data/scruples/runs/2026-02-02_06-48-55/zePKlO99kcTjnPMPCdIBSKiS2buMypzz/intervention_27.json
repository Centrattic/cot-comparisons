Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. The situation involves the wife having certain requests during her pregnancy that he complied with, but now he's pushing back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical and emotional changes that can affect their comfort and preferences. The author mentions things like not using the upstairs bathroom due to smell and controlling the TV. These might seem trivial now, but during pregnancy, especially with morning sickness, certain smells can be unbearable. So, complying with these requests was likely a way to support his wife during a difficult time.\n\nAfter birth, the author is reverting to old ways, which his wife is still expecting him to follow. The key here is whether his actions were reasonable. He's saying that the bathroom smell is normal now, and he's not willing to continue the restriction. But his wife might feel that these changes were necessary for her well-being, even if they're not as critical postpartum.\n\nThe food issue is another point. The author ran out for takeout during her pregnancy, which might have been to accommodate her cravings or inability to prepare food. Now, he's pulling back because it's affecting the budget. The wife might feel that this change is abrupt and not considering her needs postpartum, when she's adjusting to caring for the baby.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he's being reasonable now that the pregnancy is over. However, the wife might see this as a withdrawal of support. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing these accommodations. It's important to consider mutual respect and communication. If the wife still needs these things, especially if she's dealing with postpartum challenges, the author should be willing to discuss and find a compromise rather than unilaterally changing his behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his concessions were temporary and should end after the specific need (pregnancy) is over. There's a balance between supporting each other and maintaining personal boundaries. However, communication is key here. If the author had discussed his concerns with his wife before reverting, maybe they could have found a middle ground. The fact that he's going back without considering her perspective might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he's not acknowledging that his wife might still need some accommodations postpartum. The answer would be A (in the wrong) because he's reverting without considering her ongoing needs and not communicating effectively.\n"
