I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband made accommodations during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout for her. Now, after the baby was born, he's going back to his old ways, and the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The husband feels it's unreasonable now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea and heightened sense of smell, so avoiding certain smells like a bathroom could help. After giving birth, those physical needs might subside, but maybe the wife is still adjusting. The husband is reverting to old habits, but the wife expects the changes to stay in place. \n\nFor the bathroom issue, the husband's point is that the smell is normal, but during pregnancy, it was a valid request. Postpartum, maybe the wife is still sensitive or dealing with recovery, so the smell might still be an issue. However, if the husband is now using the bathroom, it's a conflict. The husband might feel it's reasonable to resume his previous behavior, but the wife might feel her needs were considered during pregnancy and should continue during recovery.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, the husband gave in because she had limited mobility. Now, after childbirth, if she's still recovering or dealing with newborn care, she might appreciate the TV as a coping mechanism. But the husband might feel that his preferences are being ignored now that she's not pregnant.\n\nTakeout issue: The wife might have been used to getting takeout during pregnancy due to lack of energy or mobility. Postpartum, she might still have physical limitations or be overwhelmed with the baby. The husband's concern about the budget is valid, but if the wife is expecting him to continue providing takeout, it's a financial strain.\n\nThe key here is that the husband is trying to return to normalcy after the pregnancy period, which is understandable. However, the wife might still be in a postpartum phase where she needs some of those accommodations for her well-being. The husband's perspective is that the pregnancy-specific needs are over, but the wife might see the postpartum period as an extension of that time.\n\nI should also consider societal norms and expectations. It's common for partners to make sacrifices during pregnancy, but there's no clear rule about how long those should last postpartum. The husband's frustration is about the ongoing demands, while the wife's perspective is about continuity of care.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to return to old ways, but he might not have considered that the postpartum period still requires some adjustments. The wife's expectations might be reasonable if she's still recovering. However, communication is key here. If the husband didn't discuss these changes with her, it could be seen as dismissive of her ongoing needs. \n\nThe husband's examples (bathroom smell, TV, takeout) are specific and practical. The wife might feel her needs are still valid, but the husband is justified in wanting to balance household responsibilities and budget. It's a balance between empathy for her postpartum state and his own needs. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to return to normal, but he might not have communicated or considered the ongoing needs of his wife postpartum. However, the answer depends on the nuances of their communication. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions were thoughtless. If he didn't consider her postpartum needs, he might be partially at fault. But if he's being reasonable and she's being unreasonable, then he's not. \n\nLooking at the examples, the husband is expressing frustration over things that were temporary during pregnancy. The bathroom smell is a basic issue\u2014normal body functions don't stink, so his point might be valid. However, during pregnancy, the sensitivity was real. Postpartum, maybe it's still an issue for her. The takeout budget is a practical concern. The husband is justified in wanting to manage finances, but if the wife is struggling with postpartum adjustments, it's a shared responsibility.\n\nOverall, it's a bit of a 50-50, but since the question is AITA, the answer could lean towards B (No, not in the wrong) because the husband is returning to pre-pregnancy habits, which is reasonable, and the wife's expectations might be extending beyond the necessary period. However, if the wife is still in a postpartum state requiring accommodations, the answer might be A. Since the husband is the one asking, and the examples are about things that were temporary during pregnancy, the answer might be B. But I need to check if postpartum considerations are part of the discussion.\n"
