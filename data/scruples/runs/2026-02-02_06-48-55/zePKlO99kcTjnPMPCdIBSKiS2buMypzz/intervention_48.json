Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after their wife gave birth, and the wife is still expecting the changes they made during her pregnancy. The author feels that some of the requests were unreasonable, like not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and taking out orders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea and sensitivity to smells, which is a common medical issue. The author complied with these requests to support their wife during a difficult time. Now, after the baby is born, the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The author is frustrated because they think these things aren't necessary anymore and are affecting their budget and comfort.\n\nI should think about the balance between empathy and self-respect. The author made sacrifices during pregnancy, which is understandable to maintain harmony and support. However, after the pregnancy, it's reasonable for them to want things to return to \"normal.\" The wife, on the other hand, might be adjusting to postpartum life and still feeling vulnerable, leading her to hold onto those changes for comfort or habit.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. Did the author communicate their feelings to the wife? The post mentions that the author is now going back to old ways, but maybe there was a lack of discussion about expectations post-birth. It's possible the wife didn't realize that the author felt these changes were no longer necessary or that they were a burden.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration is valid. For example, the bathroom issue: during pregnancy, the smell was a problem, but now it's perceived as insulting. The author is trying to reclaim their space, which is reasonable. However, approaching this with empathy and discussing it calmly could help. The author might come off as dismissive of their wife's feelings, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe takeout example: it's a financial concern, which is a valid reason to want to stop. But perhaps the wife is still adjusting to motherhood and needs some flexibility. The author's approach could be perceived as abrupt if not discussed with understanding.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author's actions might be seen as going back on their commitments, leading to the wife feeling unsupported. However, the author's perspective is that they were accommodating out of necessity during pregnancy and now want balance.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their feelings respectfully or if they're not considering the wife's adjustment period. On the other hand, if they discussed their concerns and the wife was still insistent, the blame could shift. But based on the post, there's no mention of communication attempts. The author just went back to old ways, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they may not have handled the transition back to normal with enough sensitivity and communication.\n"
