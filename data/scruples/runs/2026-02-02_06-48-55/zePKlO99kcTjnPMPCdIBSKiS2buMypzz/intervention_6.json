Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband says he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to their old normal, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her have control of the TV, and taking out for food. He feels these are unreasonable now and that he's being treated unfairly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to analyze this from both sides.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's adjusting to postpartum life, which is already stressful. He's trying to balance work, baby care, and managing the household. The demands he made during pregnancy were perhaps out of necessity, and now he's trying to reclaim his normal routine. He might be feeling overwhelmed, especially with financial concerns from the takeout.\n\nThe wife's perspective: She's dealing with postpartum recovery, possibly hormonal changes, and the new responsibilities of caring for a newborn. She might be more sensitive or need some comfort from before, trying to maintain a sense of stability. She might not realize that the husband's tolerance during pregnancy was situational, or she might genuinely find the postpartum period too challenging to adjust all her expectations.\n\nPotential issues here: The husband's sudden change in behavior might be shocking to her, causing stress. If he reverted without discussing it, that's a problem. Also, some of his examples might be trivializing her needs during pregnancy. For example, not using the bathroom upstair might have been due to her nausea, which is a legitimate medical issue. Now, expecting her to handle the smell might be insensitive. Similarly, the TV control and food orders might have been about her needing rest and comfort during a physically taxing time. Postpartum is a time when women often need continued support, not less.\n\nBut the husband's financial concerns are valid too. It's important for couples to communicate and find a balance. Maybe he should have discussed these changes with her rather than just reverting. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. If he's not considering her postpartum needs, that's a problem. However, if she's not acknowledging his stress and financial strain, that's an issue too.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. However, postpartum is a critical time for the mother, and abrupt changes in support can affect her mental health. The husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if he's not discussing these changes with her and not recognizing that her needs might still be higher. So, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong for not maintaining the support she might still need, unless they can find a compromise. Alternatively, if the wife is being unreasonable and not considering his side, it's a different story. But given the way he's phrased it, the wife's continued insistence might be due to her own stress, and he's not adjusting communication to address both their needs.\n"
