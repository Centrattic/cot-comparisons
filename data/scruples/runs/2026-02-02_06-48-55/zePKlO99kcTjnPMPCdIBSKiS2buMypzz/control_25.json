I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person is asking if they're at fault for reverting to old habits after their wife gave birth. During her pregnancy, he went along with a lot of her requests, even some he found ridiculous. Now that the baby was born (in October), he's going back to their old ways, but his wife is still expecting the same accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, allowing her to have the TV, and taking out for her. He feels it's now insulting or financially hurtful, and he's not willing to continue these things anymore.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, it's common for people to have physical discomforts, like nausea or sensitivity to smells. The husband complied with requests to make her comfortable during that time. Now that the baby is born, the physical needs might have changed. The wife seems to still want those same accommodations, but the husband is pushing back.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break down the examples:\n\n1. **Upstairs Bathroom**: During pregnancy, the smell was too much for her. Now, he thinks it's insulting to not use it. He argues that her feces do smell, so it's not a matter of her sensitivity. But during pregnancy, maybe she had heightened sensitivity due to nausea. After giving birth, her body might still be recovering, and some people might continue to have sensitive days. However, if she's not experiencing that anymore, he's justified in wanting to use the bathroom again. But did she stop needing that accommodation? The husband isn't clear on whether she still needs it or not. If she's insisting without a valid reason, maybe he's right to push back.\n\n2. **TV Control**: He let her have it because she was pregnant and had limited activities. Now, he's saying she should return to the old ways. If she's still adjusting to motherhood and needs downtime, maybe she still needs the TV. However, if she's now in a better place, maybe it's time to compromise again. But this could be a case of him expecting her to revert to pre-pregnancy behaviors, which might not be fair.\n\n3. **Takeout**: She's used to him getting takeout, but it's hurting the budget. He doesn't want to do it anymore. This seems like a reasonable concern. Financial responsibility is important. If during her pregnancy, he was accommodating her needs, but now it's a financial strain, he's within his rights to set boundaries. However, if she's still recovering or dealing with postpartum issues, maybe she needs certain comforts. But if she's insisting on takeout without considering the budget, the husband is right to say no.\n\nNow, considering the broader context. The husband did accommodate her during pregnancy, which is common and kind. Postpartum, the needs might still exist, especially if she's dealing with postpartum depression or physical recovery. However, if she's insisting on things without those needs, the husband's pushback is understandable.\n\nBut the key here is whether the wife is still in a situation where those accommodations are necessary. The husband doesn't mention if she's still experiencing medical issues. If she's just insisting because it's what she got used to, then maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. The wife might be expecting continued accommodations without considering the husband's feelings or financial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is still dealing with postpartum challenges, maybe she needs those things more than before. The husband might be reverting to old ways without considering her new circumstances. So there's a balance here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer should be based on the information given. The husband's actions are about wanting to return to their old normal, which he did during her pregnancy (accommodating her needs), but now he's resisting. If the wife's requests are no longer medically necessary, then the husband's pushback is reasonable. However, if she's still in a vulnerable state postpartum, maybe the husband should be more understanding. The examples don't specify if the wife has any ongoing health issues post-birth. The husband says \"she\u2019s still insisting on the changes,\" implying that the changes are no longer needed. If that's the case, then the husband is not in the wrong for reverting to old ways. However, the wife might be in a transition period where she still needs some accommodations. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut according to the information provided, the husband's reasoning is that some of the requests were \"ridiculous\" but he did them during pregnancy. Now he's not willing anymore. The key is that during pregnancy, he made sacrifices, but postpartum, he's trying to re-establish their previous dynamic. If the wife is not justified in still expecting those changes, then he's not wrong. The wife might be in the wrong for not recognizing that the situation has changed. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The husband's actions are about returning to their original ways, which he was doing out of consideration during pregnancy. Now, he's not willing to continue. If the wife's needs have changed, he's justified. But if she still has valid needs, maybe he's not. Since the examples don't indicate ongoing medical needs, and the husband is now feeling it's insulting or financially harmful, the answer might be B.\n"
