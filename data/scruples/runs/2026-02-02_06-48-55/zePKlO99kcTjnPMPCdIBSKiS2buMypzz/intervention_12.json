Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after their wife gave birth, but she still expects them to follow the changes they made during her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the specific issues mentioned. The author gave in to his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if they seemed ridiculous. Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting to their old habits, but she's still expecting those changes to stay. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out for food.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. I need to consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, during pregnancy, he made accommodations that were maybe not necessary but he did it to support his wife. Now, after the baby is born, he's trying to return to their normal routine. He might feel that the pregnancy-related changes are no longer needed, especially since the wife is no longer experiencing the same physical discomforts. For example, the bathroom smell was an issue during pregnancy, but now she's postpartum, so maybe the smell isn't as bad. Also, he's taking care of the baby when he gets home, so he might not have time for takeout, which is affecting the budget.\n\nOn the other hand, from the wife's perspective, some of these changes might still be necessary. Postpartum can be a time when a woman's body is still recovering, and certain accommodations might help her adjust to life with a newborn. The bathroom issue could be about her comfort, not just smell. Controlling the TV could be a way for her to have some control or mental stimulation during a stressful time. The takeout might be because she's tired from taking care of the baby and can't cook, so expecting her husband to do chores or prepare meals is understandable.\n\nIs the author wrong for not maintaining these changes? Well, making adjustments during pregnancy is common, but the transition postpartum can be challenging. There's a balance between supporting the wife and maintaining their own needs. The author might not be considering that some changes are still important for her recovery and well-being. However, the author could argue that the pregnancy-specific issues are no longer relevant, and that the budget and shared responsibilities are important for the household.\n\nThe key here is communication. Did the author discuss these changes with his wife? If they didn't talk about it, then he might be in the wrong for just reverting without considering her feelings. If they had a conversation, maybe it's a matter of differing expectations. The author might be prioritizing his own comfort and financial aspects over his wife's, which could be seen as inconsiderate. On the flip side, the wife might be expecting the same level of care postpartum, which is reasonable given the physical and emotional demands of the postpartum period.\n\nAlso, the tone of the author's examples is a bit dismissive. Saying things like \"her shit doesn't stink\" might come off as disrespectful. The wife could feel that her needs are being ignored. The author's frustration about the budget and taking over baby duties is valid, but there should be a mutual effort to find solutions, like splitting chores or finding cheaper meal options instead of just cutting takeout.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging that some of the changes made during pregnancy are still necessary, and he's reverting without proper communication. The wife is in a vulnerable period, and the husband's support is crucial. The author's dismissive attitude towards her needs (like the bathroom smell) could be damaging to their relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
