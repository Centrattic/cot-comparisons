I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a husband who made a lot of accommodations for his wife during her pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that their baby was born, he's going back to his old habits, but the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The husband feels like it's unfair and that some of the requests were unreasonable, especially the bathroom smell thing. He's also upset about the takeout food and the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical discomforts like nausea or sensitivity to smells, which can make certain accommodations necessary for their health and well-being. The husband gave in to these requests during pregnancy, which is common and often encouraged to support the pregnant partner. But now, after the baby is born, he's reverting to his old ways, and the wife might still need some of those accommodations, especially if she's recovering from childbirth.\n\nThe bathroom issue: The husband says the wife asked him not to use the upstairs bathroom because the smell was too much. During pregnancy, sensitivity to smells can be intense, so avoiding certain smells might help prevent nausea. Postpartum, the wife might still be sensitive, or maybe she's just used to the space being off-limits. The husband finds it insulting because he thinks the smell is normal, but maybe she's still dealing with it. It's possible that the wife isn't being unreasonable here; it's about her comfort.\n\nTV control: The husband allowed the wife to watch TV during pregnancy because he thought she couldn't do much else. Now that the baby is here, maybe the wife still needs rest and TV as a way to unwind and take her mind off things. The husband might be assuming she's back to her old routine, but the wife's situation hasn't really changed much postpartum. She's dealing with a newborn, which can be exhausting and stressful.\n\nTakeout food: The wife might have had trouble cooking during pregnancy, so takeout was a necessity. Postpartum, she might still be recovering and not up to cooking, especially with a new baby. The husband is concerned about the budget, but if the wife is still in a state where cooking is difficult, it's a valid need. However, the husband is right to be concerned about the budget if it's a financial strain. There might be a balance to find here, like cooking together or finding cheaper meal options.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's actions are considerate of his wife's current situation. The wife's needs postpartum can be different from before. Even if the accommodations were unusual or seemed unnecessary, they were made out of care and support during a time when she needed it. Reverting to old ways without considering that she might still need those accommodations could be seen as inconsiderate. The husband might be missing the point that some of these changes were more about her physical or emotional state than just being picky.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is not wrong to feel that some of these things are unreasonable, especially if the wife's needs have changed. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for going back to old ways. If the wife is still feeling the same needs postpartum, then the husband's refusal to maintain those accommodations without discussion might be the issue. It's important for couples to communicate and adjust as their needs change, not just revert to old patterns without considering the other's current situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging that his wife's needs might still require some of those accommodations even after giving birth. There's a balance between maintaining the household and being considerate of each other's needs. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's perspective should also be considered. The answer might be that he's in the wrong because he's not maintaining the support his wife might still need, but it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. However, the question is specifically whether he's in the wrong. Given the context, the answer might be A (Yes) because he's not considering that the wife might still need those accommodations.\n"
