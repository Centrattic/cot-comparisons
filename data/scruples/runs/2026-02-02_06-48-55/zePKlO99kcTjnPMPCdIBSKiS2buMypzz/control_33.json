Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after their wife gave birth. They had been accommodating a lot of her requests during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout for her. Now, after the baby is born, the author is reverting and the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The author feels it's unreasonable now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, hormonal changes can make a woman more sensitive to smells, which might explain why the wife asked not to use the upstairs bathroom. It's common for partners to make adjustments during this time. After birth, the author is trying to return to their normal habits, but the wife is still expecting those changes. The author feels it's unfair, especially with the financial aspect of takeouts affecting the budget.\n\nBut wait, maybe the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues or stress. Having a new baby is a huge life change, and maybe she's not used to the baby taking up so much time. The author is now handling baby duty but might feel the wife isn't sharing the load. There's a balance between respecting each other's needs and adjusting to new circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a reasonable right to revert to their old habits. Letting someone control the TV or not using a bathroom for a time is usually seen as a temporary courtesy. However, if the wife is still expecting these things months later (since the baby was born in October and the post is now), maybe she hasn't adjusted. The author's frustration with the financial impact is valid, especially if the takeouts are unnecessary now.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective might be that she's still managing the new baby and needs these accommodations. But the author is in a different position now, with the baby being the focus, so the original reasons (pregnancy) are no longer applicable. The author's actions are about returning to their previous lifestyle, which wasn't unreasonable before. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the initial accommodations were made during a specific, temporary period (pregnancy). Once that period ends, it's reasonable to return to normal. The wife might need to adjust her expectations postpartum. The answer is B.\n"
