I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. So first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, even the ridiculous ones, like not using the upstairs bathroom. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting those changes. He's upset about things like the bathroom, TV control, and takeout food.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether his actions are justified. Let's break it down. During pregnancy, he made accommodations because she was pregnant and dealing with morning sickness and the like. That's understandable and shows he was considerate. But postpartum, things have changed. The baby is born, so maybe the same accommodations aren't necessary anymore. But his wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can be physically and emotionally challenging.\n\nThe bathroom issue: he stopped using the upstairs bathroom because she couldn't handle the smell. Now, after birth, maybe she's still sensitive? Or maybe she's just used to it and doesn't want to change. The author finds the smell offensive, but he deals with it. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using air freshener or cleaning more. But he's frustrated that she's still expecting him to avoid it even though she's not pregnant anymore.\n\nTV control: during pregnancy, he let her watch all the reality shows because she couldn't do much else. Now, with a baby, maybe she's even more limited, so she still wants control. But the author might feel entitled to watch TV too. It's a matter of shared household responsibilities and mutual respect. If she's still in recovery and has less energy, maybe she needs the TV as a coping mechanism, but he's not willing to let that continue.\n\nTakeout food: during pregnancy, he would run out for her, but now it's hurting the budget. He doesn't want to do it anymore. This could be about financial responsibility versus her expectations. After childbirth, she might still have physical limitations or the demands of caring for a newborn, making takeout more necessary. But he's trying to manage the budget, which is a valid concern too.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for reverting. On one hand, he was accommodating during pregnancy, which is a reasonable and kind approach. On the other hand, postpartum is a different situation. The wife might still need support, and the author might be withdrawing help that's necessary for her recovery. However, he's also a partner now sharing responsibilities. The line between being supportive and being taken advantage of could be blurry here.\n\nBut the author is trying to reset things to normal. If the wife is still in need of those accommodations postpartum, then maybe he's not in the wrong for expecting things to go back to how they were. However, if she's still dealing with the effects of pregnancy and childbirth, maybe those accommodations are still necessary. The key is understanding her current needs versus his own.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid, especially regarding the budget and personal space. But his wife might feel that these accommodations are part of the support she needs during postpartum, which can be a critical time. The question is whether his actions are dismissive of her ongoing needs. If he's been considerate before, but now is reverting without considering her postpartum situation, maybe he's in the wrong. But if the postpartum period is over and she's still expecting the same treatment, then he's justified in wanting to return to normal.\n\nI think the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he was accommodating during pregnancy, and now is trying to return to normal. However, the postpartum period can be more intense, so maybe there's a need for continued support. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the examples given seem to be about practical things like bathroom use, TV, and takeout. The wife might be holding onto the pregnancy accommodations, but after giving birth, the situation has changed. So maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to adjust.\n"
