That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The husband says he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even when they were \"ridiculous.\" After the birth, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes. He gives examples like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for food. He feels like he's being unreasonable now that the baby is born.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the dynamics here.\n\nPregnancy and postpartum can be physically and emotionally challenging for the pregnant person. It's common for partners to adjust their behavior to support their partner's health and comfort. The husband did that during pregnancy. Now, after giving birth, there might be lingering physical discomforts or emotional needs. Maybe she's still sensitive to smells, or the TV time is a way to cope with stress. \n\nThe husband is trying to revert to old habits, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for her ongoing needs. However, he's also expressing frustration about the financial impact and his own fatigue from the responsibilities. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. If the wife is still experiencing discomforts postpartum, the husband's adjustment isn't entirely unreasonable, but if those requests are no longer medical or necessary, then maybe it's time to reassess.\n\nBut the story doesn't mention if the wife has medical reasons for continuing these requests. The husband's frustration is valid regarding financial strain and personal boundaries. However, abruptly reverting without discussing could hurt her feelings, especially after she endured the pregnancy. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband should communicate his concerns and maybe find middle ground, like setting a time limit on the bathroom rule or taking out once a week instead. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but his approach could be improved. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if the wife isn't justified, but if she's still in need, then A. Since the story doesn't specify medical reasons, it's a bit ambiguous. But Reddit often sides with the asker if the other party isn't being unreasonable. Wait, but the wife's requests might be more about habits now. The husband's reasoning for reverting is more practical. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
