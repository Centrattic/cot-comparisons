Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The situation is that during pregnancy, he made a lot of accommodations for her, even if some were unreasonable. Now, post-birth, he's trying to revert to their old habits, but she's still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. When someone is pregnant, they might have physical discomforts or emotional needs that require adjustments. The husband was accommodating, which is generally seen as supportive during that time. But after the baby is born, the immediate postpartum period can be really tough for the mother, both physically and emotionally. Hormonal changes, lack of sleep, and adjusting to a new role can make her more sensitive or clingy.\n\nThe examples given: not using the upstairs bathroom because of smell. During pregnancy, maybe she was more sensitive to smells, which is common. Now, he finds it insulting. On the other hand, the smell is a normal bodily function, so perhaps his reaction is about his own discomfort. The TV and food issues\u2014maybe she's still adjusting to the new routine, and the control of the TV is a small way she feels in control now. Takeout might have been part of her coping mechanism during pregnancy, and she might be struggling to adjust to the new normal while also dealing with motherhood.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he's tired of these accommodations and wants to return to their pre-pregnancy habits. However, the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The key here is whether his return to old ways is causing harm. If she's still recovering and the adjustments are helping her, then maybe he's being inconsiderate. But if the accommodations are unreasonable (like not using a bathroom), it's a balance between respecting her needs and his own.\n\nI think the husband is trying to reclaim his own space and routine, which is understandable. However, the wife might be going through postpartum challenges and his sudden change could be adding stress. The question is whether his actions are dismissive of her current needs. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her postpartum experience. But if the accommodations were truly unnecessary (like the bathroom smell), maybe he's not. The answer might depend on the balance and communication between them. Since the user is asking for AITA, it's likely that the community would lean towards the husband being in the right if the accommodations were excessive, but maybe not. I need to decide based on the details provided.\n"
