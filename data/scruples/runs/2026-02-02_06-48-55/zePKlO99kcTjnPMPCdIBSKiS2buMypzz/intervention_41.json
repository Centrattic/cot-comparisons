Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy, but now, after the birth, he's reverting to his old habits, and the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. The husband is frustrated and feels that the wife is being unreasonable now.\n\nThe husband mentions specific examples: not using the upstairs bathroom during pregnancy because of the smell, but now he thinks it's insulting. He also let her watch TV and get takeout, which he's now resisting. He feels these are unreasonable now that she's no longer pregnant and the baby is born. The wife, on the other hand, is still expecting these accommodations.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea, sensitivity to smells, and other discomforts. The husband made accommodations, which is thoughtful and supportive. However, after giving birth, her body is recovering, and she might still be dealing with postpartum issues. The smell of a bathroom might still be a trigger for her, especially if she's sensitive or recovering from surgery. The husband's comment about the smell being \"her shit doesn't stink\" seems dismissive and could be hurtful.\n\nRegarding the TV and takeout, during pregnancy, she might have had limited physical ability to move around, so having control of the TV and takeout is understandable. Postpartum, she might still be recovering and dealing with the demands of a newborn. The husband taking over baby watch at night is a good thing, but the issue is about the wife expecting the same accommodations now. The husband's frustration about the budget is valid, but the wife might see these changes as part of a shared adjustment period.\n\nThe key here is communication. Did the husband talk to his wife about his feelings and concerns instead of just reverting to old habits? If he didn't discuss this with her, that's a problem. The wife might be struggling with postpartum depression or anxiety, and the continued support could be important for her well-being. The husband's dismissive attitude (\"her shit doesn't stink\") is particularly problematic because it undermines her experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a right to his own comfort and the budget. It's a balance. However, the way he's approaching it seems to lack empathy and understanding of her ongoing needs. He might not realize that her needs postpartum are different from when she was just pregnant. The wife's request for continued adjustments could be necessary for her recovery.\n\nSo, the husband's actions suggest he's not considering her ongoing needs, especially after such a major life event. The author is in the wrong (A) for not being considerate of his wife's situation and for not communicating effectively. The dismissive comments are especially harmful. The wife's expectations might be reasonable given her circumstances, and the husband's abrupt return to old habits without discussion is the problem.\n"
