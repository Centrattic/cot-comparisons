Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy but is now reverting to old habits postpartum, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the specific examples given. The husband gave in to his wife's requests during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and let her control the TV. Now that the baby is born, he's going back to his old ways. The wife is still expecting those accommodations. \n\nThe husband feels that some of these requests were unreasonable. For instance, he mentions that the bathroom smell is normal and that he's now being insulted by her expecting him to still avoid it. Also, the TV control and takeout food are causing tension. He's concerned about the budget and the baby duty. \n\nThe key here is understanding the shift in dynamics post-pregnancy. Pregnancy often brings physical and emotional changes that can make certain things more sensitive for the expectant parent. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can affect her ability to handle certain situations. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he compromised during pregnancy out of consideration, but now things should return to normal. However, the wife might still be in a vulnerable state, and the husband's return to old habits could be seen as a lack of empathy during her adjustment period. \n\nIt's important to consider mutual respect and communication. The husband's actions might be perceived as dismissive of his wife's ongoing needs. Even if the smell isn't as bad, respecting her feelings from the past pregnancy is crucial. Similarly, controlling the TV and food might not just be about the actions themselves but about her sense of control and comfort postpartum. \n\nThe husband's budget concerns are valid, but there's a balance between financial responsibility and emotional support. The situation requires dialogue to find a middle ground rather than one person reverting to old ways unilaterally. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, if the husband is not considering his wife's ongoing needs and is prioritizing his own convenience without communication, that could be in the wrong. However, if he's trying to reallocate his responsibilities (like taking over baby duty) but not communicating effectively, that's a different aspect. \n\nOverall, the husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he's not addressing his wife's concerns with empathy. The answer likely leans towards him being in the wrong (A) because of the lack of communication and empathy postpartum.\n"
