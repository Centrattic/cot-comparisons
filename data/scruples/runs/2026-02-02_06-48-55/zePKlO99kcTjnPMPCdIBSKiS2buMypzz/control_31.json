I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old habits after the birth of their daughter, but the wife is still expecting the same changes they made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions giving in to the wife's requests during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. After the baby was born, the author stopped complying, which the wife is upset about. The author feels that the wife's current demands are unreasonable, like the bathroom smell and takeout costs.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and health issues can make some things more sensitive for the expecting parent. For example, nausea and smell sensitivity are common. The author complied then, which is thoughtful. But after the baby is born, those specific needs might not be as necessary. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can have physical and emotional challenges.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable regarding the financial aspect of takeout and wanting to resume normal routines. However, the wife's insistence might stem from the stress of caring for a newborn, which is a significant adjustment. Maybe the wife isn't just being stubborn but is still in a vulnerable state. \n\nThe key here is whether the author was unreasonable to expect the wife to adjust post-birth. The author is the one who made exceptions during pregnancy out of consideration. Now, after the baby is born, the dynamic changes. The wife might not be returning to her pre-pregnancy state immediately and needs support in different ways now.\n\nBut the author is also a parent now and might be feeling overwhelmed with baby duties, leading to resentment over the continued demands. The bathroom issue is a bit about practicality. The author might feel that the wife's old needs aren't valid anymore. However, the wife might still have postpartum issues affecting her comfort.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are dismissive of the wife's ongoing needs. The author's actions post-birth could be seen as reverting to pre-pregnancy behavior without considering the wife's current situation. The wife might need more support during this transition period. On the other hand, the author has legitimate concerns about fairness and financial strain.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the middle ground is the answer. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions might be seen as not fully supporting the wife during a vulnerable time. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps the wife's needs should be addressed through communication rather than expecting the author to revert to old ways. Alternatively, the wife might need to recognize the author's contributions post-birth.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as they are adjusting to new roles and responsibilities. However, there's room for both to communicate better. The initial compliance during pregnancy was good, but expecting the same post-birth without mutual discussion might not be fair. The answer B (No) might be correct because the author's return to normal is reasonable, and the wife should adjust. But considering the sensitivity of postpartum care, maybe the author should still be accommodating. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to make sure I'm not making assumptions about postpartum needs. The key is that the author's actions now might be seen as not supporting the wife enough during her recovery, making him partially at fault. But the answer options are A or B. Given the details, the author's actions might not be entirely wrong because the wife's needs during pregnancy didn't continue indefinitely. So answer B.\n"
