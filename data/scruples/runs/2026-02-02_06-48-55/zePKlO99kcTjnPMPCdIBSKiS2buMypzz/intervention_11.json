Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even some that seemed ridiculous. Now, after the birth, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the husband's perspective: he felt he had to comply during the pregnancy because of her needs, maybe due to morning sickness or other pregnancy-related discomforts. Now, he feels she's being unreasonable by still expecting those accommodations, especially since the baby is born and she's not necessarily as affected by those issues anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be dealing with postpartum challenges, hormonal changes, or just needing some time to adjust. Maybe she's used to those changes and feels it's part of their new routine. Also, controlling the TV or certain habits could be part of her coping mechanisms or stress relief after childbirth. \n\nThe husband's points: the bathroom smell is a real issue, and he's frustrated that she's still making him avoid the upstairs bathroom. The TV control during pregnancy might have been necessary for her well-being, but now she's still expecting it. The takeout budget is another point where he feels it's affecting their finances and he's taking care of the baby now.\n\nBut wait, postpartum is a time when many women experience heightened sensitivity or anxiety. Maybe the wife is still adjusting, and the husband's sudden return to old habits could be causing her stress. Also, he might be underestimating her emotional state. \n\nThe key here is communication. Did they talk about these changes postpartum? If the husband just reverted without discussing, that's a problem. Maybe she's still in a vulnerable period and needs support. The husband's frustration is valid, but abruptly stopping all accommodations without addressing her feelings could be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: the husband's actions might be seen as insensitive if he's dismissing her needs without understanding her postpartum experience. However, his financial concerns and the practicality of the requests (like bathroom smell) are also valid. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the husband considered her feelings and discussed these changes. If he just went back to old ways without talking, he's in the wrong. If they had a conversation and she's still unreasonable, maybe not. But the post doesn't mention communication. So, the default assumption might be that he didn't talk to her, leading to her feeling ignored. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for not addressing her feelings and adjusting postpartum dynamics.\n"
