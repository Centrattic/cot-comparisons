Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even if they were unreasonable. Now, postpartum, he's reverting to their previous habits, which is causing friction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be physically and emotionally taxing, so it's common for partners to make accommodations. The author did what he felt was necessary to support his wife during that time. Now, after birth, she's still expecting those same accommodations, but he's trying to return to normalcy. \n\nThe examples given are things like using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The author feels that some of these are unreasonable now. For instance, he mentions the bathroom smell, which he thinks is a normal issue and that giving in was unnecessary. The TV control and takeout are about his wife getting used to certain privileges during pregnancy.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his own needs and the household budget. It's reasonable for him to want to resume normal routines after the pregnancy. On the other hand, the wife might still be adjusting to postpartum life, which can bring its own challenges like fatigue, mood swings, or lack of time for self-care. She might rely on these small comforts to manage stress and the demands of caring for a newborn.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't discuss these changes with his wife and just unilaterally stopped doing things. However, if he communicated his concerns and she's still not cooperating, then maybe it's a mutual issue. The question is whether his actions are hurtful or dismissive of her ongoing needs. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but postpartum is a time when support is still crucial. Giving up on accommodations that were made during pregnancy too quickly might add stress to the wife. However, the author isn't entirely wrong to want to balance things. Maybe a middle ground is needed. But according to the scenario, the author is just going back to old ways without considering that the wife's needs might still be legitimate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not acknowledging that some accommodations might still be necessary even after birth. But I'm a bit conflicted because the examples he gives seem trivial. However, in the context of postpartum care, even small things can matter. The wife might need those comforts to cope, especially with the baby's demands. The author's return to old ways could be seen as dismissive of her ongoing struggles.\n"
