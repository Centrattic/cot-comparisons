Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. The key points here are about the husband's behavior post-pregnancy and his wife's expectations.\n\nFirst, during the pregnancy, the husband made several accommodations, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. He did these out of consideration for her pregnancy symptoms. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to normal, but the wife still expects those changes to continue. The husband feels that some of these requests are unreasonable now, especially since the physical discomforts of pregnancy have passed. For example, the bathroom issue\u2014he's upset that she's still not allowing him to use the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, which he finds unreasonable. Also, the food situation where she expects takeout despite the budget impact.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The wife was pregnant and likely dealing with nausea or other symptoms, so the husband's initial accommodations were appropriate. However, after the baby is born, those reasons may no longer apply. The husband is trying to return to a balanced partnership, which is reasonable. On the other hand, the wife might still be recovering and dealing with postpartum challenges, so expecting some accommodations is understandable. But if the husband is now being disrespectful (like calling her stool smelly) or not considering her new postpartum needs, that's where the issue could lie.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's reverting to old habits without considering his wife's ongoing needs postpartum, maybe he's not in the wrong if those habits are reasonable. But if the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues that require some adjustments, he should be considerate. The key is communication. The husband might be justified in not following all the previous rules, but his approach\u2014like being dismissive about the bathroom smell\u2014could be problematic. He should talk to his wife about the budget and other issues, rather than just reverting without discussion. So maybe the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could handle it better. The answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that communication is needed.\n"
