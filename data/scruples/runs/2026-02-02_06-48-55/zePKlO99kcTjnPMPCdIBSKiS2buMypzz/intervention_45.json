I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after giving birth, he's going back to his old ways, and she's still expecting him to follow those changes. The user is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical discomfort or nausea, which can make certain smells or activities unpleasant. The author gave in to her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom, maybe because he wanted to support her during that time. But after the baby was born, he's pushing back, saying that those things aren't necessary anymore. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The author complied during pregnancy due to her needs.\n2. After birth, he's reverting to old habits, which she's still expecting him to follow.\n3. The examples given (bathroom use, TV control, takeout) are things he now finds unreasonable or burdensome.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong for doing this. From a relationship perspective, mutual respect and communication are important. If during pregnancy he made concessions for her well-being, maybe there was an unspoken agreement or expectation that some of those would continue postpartum. However, postpartum is a different phase where both partners might have new dynamics. \n\nThe wife might feel that some adjustments are necessary for the baby's care or her own recovery. If the author is unilaterally reverting without discussing it with her, that could be a problem. He might be dismissing her needs now, just as he was accommodating before. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might be overwhelmed with the new baby and trying to manage household responsibilities. The takeout issue affecting the budget is a practical concern. However, the way he's framing it (\"her shit doesn't stink\") could be dismissive of her feelings, which is disrespectful.\n\nI think the author is partly in the wrong because he's not considering that some of her needs might still be valid postpartum. For example, maybe the bathroom smell is a hygiene issue for her, or she's still adjusting. Also, the way he's phrased the bathroom comment is a bit rude. However, he's also not entirely wrong because the pregnancy-related accommodations might not be necessary now. The main issue is the lack of communication and mutual discussion about what's needed now. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his actions are disrespectful or dismissive. Since he's not communicating and is being dismissive, he might be at fault. The right approach would be to talk it out and find a middle ground. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, based on the question's phrasing, the user thinks he is in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Considering the tone and the examples given, I'll go with A.\n"
