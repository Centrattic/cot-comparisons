I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The situation involves several points: during pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her watch TV, and taking out food. Now, post-birth, he's reverting and she's not happy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can cause physical discomfort and emotional changes. The husband made accommodations during that time, which is common. Now that she's postpartum, she might still be adjusting, both physically and emotionally. The husband is trying to go back to normal, but she's expecting those changes to stay. \n\nThe examples given: the bathroom issue. During pregnancy, maybe the smell was a problem because of her sensitivity. Postpartum, maybe she's still sensitive or there's another reason she's insisting. The husband thinks it's insulting, but maybe she's still dealing with postpartum issues. \n\nTV control: during pregnancy, she had it because she couldn't do much else. Now, maybe she needs that routine or feels less active. The husband might feel that he's earned his TV time back, but she might feel it's part of the partnership. \n\nTakeout and budget: he's concerned about the financial impact. It's a practical issue. She might have gotten used to it during pregnancy, but now it's affecting their finances. He's trying to balance responsibility here. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The husband's actions might be seen as reverting to old habits without considering her current state. Postpartum can be a challenging time with hormonal changes, fatigue, and stress. She might need more support. If he's stopping the takeout, maybe she's struggling with adjusting to motherhood and needs that comfort. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to return to normal, which is understandable. But by not considering her perspective, he might be neglecting her needs. The key here is whether his actions are causing harm. If he's being dismissive of her feelings (like calling her smell \"insulting\"), that's a problem. He should approach this with empathy, discuss the budget, and find compromises. Maybe he's not in the wrong entirely, but he could be more considerate. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for him to improve. However, the way he's phrased things, like saying her \"shit doesn't stink,\" shows a lack of respect, which could be problematic. So maybe he is in the wrong because of how he's handling the situation disrespectfully. \n\nWait, the options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no. If his behavior is dismissive and disrespectful, then A. If he's just trying to return to normal without malice, then B. The line in the bathroom example where he says it's \"insulting\" and implies she's wrong could be seen as disrespectful. That might tip the balance towards A.\n"
