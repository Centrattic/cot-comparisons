Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy but now, after the baby was born, is going back to their old ways. The wife is still expecting those changes to continue. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical discomfort or sensitivities. The husband complied with her requests out of love and support. Postpartum, the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The husband feels it's unreasonable now, especially with examples like bathroom smells and TV control.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and communication. The husband might think he's justified in reverting to old habits, but the wife might feel her needs are still valid. For instance, postpartum can bring physical and emotional challenges. The smell of a bathroom might still be a sensitive issue for her, and she might need the TV as a way to cope with stress or fatigue. The takeout issue could be about convenience, especially if she's dealing with the new baby's demands.\n\nHowever, the husband's perspective is that these requests are now unnecessary and burdensome. He's trying to balance the household budget and his own needs. The conflict arises from differing expectations. It's possible neither is entirely wrong, but the husband might be in the wrong if he didn't consider her ongoing needs. On the other hand, he's within his rights to set boundaries after the pregnancy, especially if those accommodations were temporary.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the expectations were mutual. If the husband never discussed these changes postpartum, it's a communication breakdown. But if the wife assumed they'd continue indefinitely without checking in, that's also an issue. The husband is returning to his old ways without considering that some needs might persist. For example, the bathroom smell could be a real issue for her health, and the takeout might be a matter of her not wanting to leave the baby. The TV control might be her way of relaxing after caring for the baby.\n\nSo, the husband might be in the wrong because he's dismissing her ongoing needs without dialogue. He should communicate his concerns and find a compromise. But if the accommodations were only meant during pregnancy and there's no medical or emotional need to continue, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, postpartum is a transition period, and some adjustments might still be necessary. The answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's not considering her continued needs and isn't communicating effectively, leading to resentment. But I'm a bit torn because it's a complex situation with valid points on both sides.\n"
