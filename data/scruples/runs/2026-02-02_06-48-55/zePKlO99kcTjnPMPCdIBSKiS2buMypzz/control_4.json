I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's wife was pregnant, and he gave in to a lot of her requests, even if they seemed ridiculous. Now, after giving birth, he's going back to their old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples given are not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out food for her.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is being reasonable. During pregnancy, certain requests can be due to physical discomfort or health issues. For example, avoiding certain smells or dietary changes are common. The author complied during pregnancy, which is understandable because he loves his wife and wanted to support her through a difficult time. Now that the baby is born, the physical constraints might be gone, so he's reverting to normal behavior. \n\nBut the wife is still expecting those same accommodations. The author feels that some of these are no longer necessary. For instance, the bathroom smell issue: during pregnancy, maybe the smell was more irritating, but now he's upset because he's using it. The TV control is another one\u2014she was allowed to watch more because she was confined to bed or less active during pregnancy. Now that the baby is here, maybe she's still expecting to have control over the TV, which the author is resisting.\n\nThe food issue is about takeout. He's running out for her, which is affecting the budget. The author is now saying he can't keep doing that. So the main conflict is about adjusting back to a normal routine after pregnancy, where the wife is still holding onto the pregnancy-era accommodations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, during pregnancy, he made sacrifices for her comfort. Now, it's time to readjust. But the wife might still need some adjustments postpartum, especially if she's recovering or dealing with postpartum depression. However, some of the examples, like bathroom smell, might be more about his own habits now. The author is trying to communicate that these aren't necessary anymore. \n\nThe key here is communication. Did he talk to her about these changes? The question is whether he's wrong for going back to old ways. If the wife is still in recovery, maybe some accommodations are needed. But if she's insisting on things that are no longer necessary, the author has a point. However, the way he's phrasing it might come off as dismissive. He mentions \"her shit doesn't stink\" which is pretty blunt and could be hurtful. \n\nSo, the author's intentions are to return to normalcy, but the way he's handling it could be causing issues. The wife might feel unsupported or that her needs aren't being considered postpartum. Maybe there's a middle ground. But strictly speaking, if the author is trying to adjust and the wife is holding onto past behaviors, the fault isn't entirely on one side. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's trying to revert to normal and the wife is still expecting adjustments, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but he needs to communicate better. The examples he gives suggest that some of the accommodations were specific to pregnancy and not necessary now. So the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
