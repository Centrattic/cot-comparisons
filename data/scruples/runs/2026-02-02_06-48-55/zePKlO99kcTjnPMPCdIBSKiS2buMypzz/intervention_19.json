Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author wrote about going back to their old ways after their wife gave birth. They mention that during pregnancy, they complied with her requests, even ridiculous ones, but now they're not doing it anymore. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the changes the wife requested during pregnancy and the author's decision to revert to old habits postpartum. The author feels that these changes are no longer necessary and are causing tension.\n\nThe wife's perspective might be that she's still adjusting to new motherhood, dealing with postpartum recovery, and possibly dealing with stress or fatigue. Her requests during pregnancy could be due to legitimate discomfort, like nausea, which is common. Now, after giving birth, she might be trying to maintain a routine or deal with new challenges, and the sudden change in behavior from the husband could be confusing or hurtful. The bathroom issue: during pregnancy, some women are more sensitive to smells, which can be linked to hormonal changes. Even if the smell is normal, her sensitivity was real at the time. The TV and food issues might be about her needing comfort or specific needs during a time when she's less mobile or energetic.\n\nThe author's argument is that the changes were only necessary during pregnancy and that the wife is being unreasonable now. However, postpartum can be a time when a woman's needs don't just vanish. She might still be dealing with physical or emotional challenges. The husband's abrupt return to old habits without considering her current state could be seen as dismissive of her ongoing needs. The budget issue is practical, but the wife might need the takeout for other reasons, like not having the energy to cook. The author might not be considering the emotional aspect here\u2014maybe she's used to the routine and it's a small comfort after the stress of childbirth.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but maybe the answer isn't so clear. The author is trying to realign their behavior based on the change in circumstances. However, communication is key here. If the author had discussed these changes with his wife and explained his reasoning, maybe it would be different. Instead, he's just going back, which could be seen as not respecting her current situation. The wife might feel that her legitimate needs during pregnancy were met, and now she's not being heard again. It's possible that the author is in the right if the changes are unnecessary, but if he's not considering her postpartum needs, he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on the context, but since the user asked for a binary choice (A or B), I have to decide based on the given info. The examples the author gives could be seen as trivializing the wife's real needs, so the author might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
