I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, but she's still expecting the same accommodations she had during pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband says he loved his wife and gave in to her requests during pregnancy, even if some were ridiculous. Now, after the baby was born, he stopped those accommodations, and the wife is still insisting on them. The examples given are the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. \n\nThe husband feels that things like bathroom smell are normal and he's dealing with it, but it's now an issue. The TV control was given during pregnancy because she had limited mobility, but now he's taking it back. The food part is about the budget and not wanting to keep ordering takeout.\n\nI need to consider the context. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and nausea can make smells more sensitive, so the bathroom smell might have been a real problem for her. After birth, those symptoms might ease, so the husband may not need to avoid the bathroom. However, postpartum, women often face different challenges, like fatigue and caring for a newborn, which could make it hard for her to adjust back to pre-pregnancy routines. \n\nThe husband's point is that he's doing his fair share, like handling baby watch, so why should he still go out of his way to order takeout? The wife might feel that the postpartum period is just as challenging and needs continued support. \n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Well, adjusting after pregnancy is a common issue. The key is communication. By the time the baby is born, they should have discussed these changes. If the husband didn't communicate his feelings during pregnancy or after, that's a problem. But if he's just returning to normal without considering her new situation, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nTakeout might be a point where budget is a concern, but maybe the wife is still recovering and needs that flexibility. However, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to manage the budget. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The husband might not be completely wrong, but the wife's perspective is also valid. The answer might depend on whether the husband addressed these issues with her rather than just going back to old ways. Since the post is from his perspective, and he's asking if he's in the wrong, the community might see it as a mutual adjustment issue. \n\nBut in AITA scenarios, often the person who doesn't consider the other's ongoing needs is at fault. Here, the husband is reverting without considering that her postpartum needs might be different, even if not the same as during pregnancy. So maybe he is in the wrong. However, if the wife didn't communicate her continued needs, that's on her. \n\nHmm. The examples given\u2014the bathroom smell, TV control, and takeout\u2014are things that during pregnancy were necessary, but postpartum might not require the same accommodations. But maybe the wife is still dealing with postpartum fatigue and other issues, so she can't adjust as quickly. \n\nIn many cases, the postpartum period is when women need more support, not less. So if the husband is cutting back on support, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But he also has his own needs, like time and budget. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband communicated his feelings before making the changes. If he just went back to old habits without discussing it, that's a problem. If he did discuss and there's a misunderstanding, that's different. Since the scenario doesn't mention communication from his side, maybe he is at fault for not having the conversation. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her ongoing needs postpartum and didn't communicate his changes. However, there's also a case for B if the wife should have adjusted. But in AITA situations, the person who unilaterally changes things without discussion is often the one at fault. So maybe A.\n"
