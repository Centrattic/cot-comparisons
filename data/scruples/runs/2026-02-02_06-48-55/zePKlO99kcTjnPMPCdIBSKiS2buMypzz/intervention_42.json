I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband changed his behavior during his wife's pregnancy to accommodate her needs, but after the baby was born, he's reverting to old habits, and the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The examples given include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her have control of the TV, and taking out orders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to adjust their behavior to support the pregnant person's physical and emotional needs. The husband did that, which shows consideration. Now, after the birth, the wife is still holding onto those changes. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for going back to his old ways.\n\nLooking at the examples: the bathroom issue. The wife during pregnancy couldn't handle the smell, so he avoided using it. Now, she's saying it's insulting because the smell is real. The husband is frustrated because he's not being let to use the bathroom. It's a matter of respecting boundaries. However, after the pregnancy, the wife's needs might have changed, but maybe she's still adjusting. The husband's frustration is valid, but maybe he should communicate better with her instead of just going back to old ways without discussing.\n\nThe TV example: he let her have control during pregnancy because she was confined. Postpartum, maybe she's still adjusting, but he's not being accommodating anymore. The wife might feel that her needs are still valid, especially if she's dealing with newborn responsibilities. The husband's point is that he doesn't want to give up control now, but maybe the wife is still in a vulnerable state.\n\nFood issue: she's used to takeout during pregnancy and now expects it. The husband is concerned about the budget. It's a financial issue, but also about expectations. He's taking over baby duty, so maybe she expects him to handle her meals too. But he's stretched thin, so it's a balance between his capacity and her needs.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The husband was accommodating during a difficult time, which is commendable. However, postpartum is a challenging period for the mother as well. Maybe the wife is still adjusting and the husband should be more understanding. On the other hand, the husband's needs and the family's budget are also important. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. If the husband went back without discussing it, he might be in the wrong. But if they're not communicating, it's a two-way issue. The examples given are about boundaries that were set during pregnancy, and postpartum, those boundaries might not be as necessary, but the wife's feelings are important. The husband's frustration is real, but he needs to approach it with empathy.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and communication. The husband's intention was to accommodate during pregnancy, but now he's reverting. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't respect her ongoing boundaries. However, the husband is also adjusting to new responsibilities. The answer might depend on whether the wife is still in a vulnerable state postpartum, which she could be. So maybe the husband is not entirely in the wrong, but he should communicate better. Alternatively, if the wife's requests are reasonable and he's disregarding them, he might be in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The examples given are about things that were reasonable during pregnancy but might not be as critical postpartum. However, the wife might still need some support. The husband's frustration with the budget and responsibilities is valid. It's a balance. The husband's actions could be seen as reverting without considering the wife's current situation. So maybe the answer is that he is in the wrong (A) because he's not considering her ongoing needs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, he's not in the wrong (B) because he was accommodating during a specific time and adjusting now. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the information.\n"
