That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after giving birth, he's going back to his old ways, and she's still expecting those changes. He's frustrated because things like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out for takeout are now issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make adjustments to support the pregnant person, even if some of the requests seem odd. The husband complied, which is good. Now, after the baby's birth, the wife is still expecting these accommodations. The husband feels he's being unreasonable now, like the bathroom smell is normal, she shouldn't have full control of the TV, and he's upset about the takeout costs.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and boundaries. During pregnancy, the husband made accommodations out of love and compassion. Postpartum, the wife might still be adjusting, both physically and emotionally. It's possible she's dealing with postpartum depression or fatigue, making it hard to let go of the changes. The husband might be feeling that his needs are being neglected, especially since he's taking over baby duty and doesn't want to keep spending on takeout.\n\nBut I should consider the wife's perspective. She might feel that the changes were necessary for her comfort during pregnancy and that continuing them helps her cope postpartum. Maybe she's struggling with new responsibilities and the adjustments in the household. The husband's frustration is valid, but abrupt changes after a period of accommodation could strain the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong for reverting. If he's communicating his feelings and trying to negotiate, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's dismissing her needs without understanding, that could be an issue. The examples given\u2014like the bathroom smell, TV control, and takeout\u2014seem like they could be resolved through discussion. Maybe finding a middle ground, like using air fresheners for the bathroom, sharing TV time, or preparing meals together instead of takeout.\n\nIn AITA posts, often the resolution is about communication and mutual adjustment. The husband might not be entirely in the wrong if he's trying to balance his needs, but he might need to approach the wife with empathy and talk about their expectations. If he's being dismissive of her feelings, that's a problem. The wife might need to recognize that some changes aren't necessary anymore, but that's also a two-way street.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. The husband's actions are understandable, but he should communicate his feelings and work with his wife to adjust postpartum. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he wasn't being unreasonable during pregnancy and is now trying to adjust back, maybe he's justified. But the wife's perspective is also important. The final answer is B.\n"
