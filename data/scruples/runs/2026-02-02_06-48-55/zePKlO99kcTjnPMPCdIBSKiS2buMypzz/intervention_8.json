Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even some he found ridiculous. Now, after the birth, he's reverting to their old ways, but his wife is still expecting the changes he made during pregnancy. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out takeout for her. The author feels these are unreasonable now and is frustrated.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that he was accommodating during the pregnancy due to her being pregnant, but now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal. His wife, however, seems to still expect those accommodations. \n\nFrom a relationship dynamics standpoint, pregnancy and postpartum are times when hormonal changes and physical recovery can make a person more sensitive or have different needs. The wife might be struggling with adjusting to motherhood, and the changes made during pregnancy could have become part of her routine or a way to cope with stress. The author's sudden return to old habits might be seen as dismissive of her ongoing needs, even if they were initially made for her comfort during pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not wrong to feel that some of these requests are unreasonable now. For example, the bathroom issue might be a matter of personal hygiene. However, the key here is communication. If the author didn't discuss these changes with his wife postpartum, he might be assuming she should just accept the old ways without considering her perspective. It's possible that his wife is still dealing with postpartum challenges and may need continued support. \n\nThe author's approach of unilaterally stopping the takeout orders could be financially burdensome for her, especially if she's not working or has limited mobility with a newborn. The TV control issue might relate to her needing entertainment or distraction after the stress of childbirth. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's important to assess intent. The author claims he made changes out of love and consideration during pregnancy. Now, he's trying to reassert his previous habits. However, if his wife is still struggling, abruptly ending those accommodations without dialogue could be seen as neglecting her current needs. The author might not be in the wrong if he's communicating his needs and finding a compromise, but if he's dismissing her without understanding, then he could be at fault.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The examples given are about the author not considering his wife's continued needs postpartum. The wife's persistence might be due to her own challenges, and the author's return to old ways might not account for that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not maintaining the accommodations that were necessary during a vulnerable time for his wife. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
