I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so it's a situation where someone is asking if their actions are unreasonable.\n\nThe author says that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave into a lot of her requests, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" Now that she's given birth, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but she's still expecting the same accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom (because she thought the smell was bad during pregnancy), letting her have control of the TV, and taking out takeout for her which now is affecting the budget.\n\nSo, the key points here are: During pregnancy, the author was very accommodating, but postpartum, he's trying to reset things. He feels that some of the things he did during pregnancy are no longer necessary, so he's pushing back. The wife, however, is still expecting those things. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for going back to old ways after giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy is a time when women's bodies go through a lot of changes, and some things that might seem trivial can be genuinely uncomfortable. For example, smell sensitivity during pregnancy is a common issue. The author's willingness to accommodate that during pregnancy is probably seen as supportive. However, after birth, maybe the wife is still dealing with recovery, and perhaps the smell of the bathroom could affect her physically, but if she's not experiencing that anymore, maybe it's not an issue. But the author is saying that now he's trying to go back to normal, and she's still enforcing those rules.\n\nAnother point is the TV control. During pregnancy, she had control because there wasn't much she could do, but postpartum, maybe she's still dealing with recovery, which could limit her activities. However, the author is taking over night watch for the baby, which is a significant responsibility. The takeout issue is about budgeting; he's concerned about the financial impact and wants to stop doing that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife might feel that some of these things are still necessary for her well-being postpartum, or maybe she's still adjusting. The author might feel that the pregnancy accommodations were temporary and shouldn't be permanent. But there's a balance here. The author is trying to return to normal, but the wife might be in a vulnerable postpartum period where she's still needing support, even if it's not the same as during pregnancy.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's possible that the author is being reasonable in trying to adjust back to their normal life, but it's also important to consider that postpartum can be a challenging time with its own set of needs. The wife might be struggling with the transition, and the author's pushback could be causing stress. However, the author has valid points about the financial impact and the physical reality that bodily functions have smells.\n\nI think the answer hinges on communication. If the author is not communicating his concerns and just enforcing changes without considering his wife's current state, that could be the issue. On the other hand, if the wife is overstepping by maintaining the same expectations without considering the husband's perspective, that's also a problem. But in the context of the question, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for going back to old ways. The subreddit usually looks for whether the person is being unreasonable.\n\nThe key here is that the author was accommodating during pregnancy, which is understandable. Now, he's trying to adjust back. However, postpartum can have its own challenges, and the wife might still need some adjustments. The author's tone comes across as dismissive of her needs (\"her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does.\") which might indicate a lack of empathy. If he's being dismissive and not considering her postpartum needs, that could make him the asshole. However, if the wife is being unreasonable by maintaining the same rules without reason, she could be at fault. \n\nBut given that pregnancy-related needs are temporary, the author might have a point in returning to normal. However, if the wife is still dealing with postpartum symptoms (which can include physical and emotional challenges), the author's refusal to accommodate could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on whether the wife's requests are based on legitimate needs or just habit. The examples given (bathroom smell, TV control, takeout) might be things that were reasonable during pregnancy but are less so now. However, if the wife is still sensitive to smells postpartum, that's a different scenario. The author's comment about the bathroom smell being insulting suggests he's now treating her request as disrespectful, which could be a communication problem.\n\nIn the end, the author is trying to reset things, but if he's being dismissive and not engaging in a dialogue to find a middle ground, he could be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife is being unreasonable, she might be at fault. Since the question is about the author's actions, the answer would depend on whether his actions are unreasonable. The subreddit often looks for whether someone is being unfair or inconsiderate. The author's initial willingness to accommodate during pregnancy is good, but now he's pushing back. If the wife is still in a state where she needs those accommodations, he's being inconsiderate. If not, he's justified.\n\nGiven the information, the examples the author gives seem like they could be temporary accommodations. The author is trying to return to normal, which is reasonable, but if the wife is still in need, he's being inconsiderate. However, the way the author presents his perspective (calling her requests \"insulting\" and \"ridiculous\") might indicate a lack of empathy, making him the asshole. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her postpartum needs and is being dismissive.\n"
