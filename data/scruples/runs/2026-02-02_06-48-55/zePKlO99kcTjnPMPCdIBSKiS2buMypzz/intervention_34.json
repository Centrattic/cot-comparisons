Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to many of her requests, even if they were unreasonable. Now, after the birth, he's reverting to his old habits, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The husband's actions during pregnancy were accommodating, which is common and often necessary for a pregnant partner. However, postpartum, he's trying to go back to the old ways, which the wife is resisting. The examples given are about using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. \n\nThe husband might feel that his accommodations during pregnancy were temporary and that now, with the baby's arrival, things should return to normal. But the wife might view these changes as necessary for their new family dynamics, not just for her comfort during pregnancy. Postpartum is a time of significant adjustment, and the wife could be dealing with physical and emotional challenges that make certain accommodations still important. Plus, the husband's frustration about the budget and time is understandable, but it's about balancing his needs with his wife's.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's resentment about the bathroom smell or the takeout might be due to not discussing these issues with his wife. Maybe the wife is still adjusting to her postpartum body, and the smell is a sensitive issue. The TV control could be about her need for relaxation after childbirth. The takeout might be a matter of her needing to rest and focus on the baby, so she relies on him for that.\n\nThe husband might be in the wrong if he's not considering his wife's perspective and the new demands of parenting. Reverting to old habits without discussing the changes could strain their relationship. On the other hand, if the wife isn't acknowledging his contributions and the financial impact, that's also a problem. But the primary issue seems to be the husband's unilateral decision to stop accommodating without addressing his wife's possible ongoing needs.\n\nIn many relationships, especially after a major life event like childbirth, both partners need to adapt. The husband's approach might come off as dismissive of his wife's experiences and needs, which can lead to conflict. So, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he's not considering her ongoing needs and hasn't communicated effectively.\n"
