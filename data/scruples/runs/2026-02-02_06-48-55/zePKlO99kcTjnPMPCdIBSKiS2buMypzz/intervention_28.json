Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author mentions that during their wife's pregnancy, he gave into a lot of her requests, even when they were \"ridiculous.\" Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, letting her control the TV for reality shows, and taking out takeout, which is affecting the budget. After the birth, he's trying to revert to their old normal, but his wife is still insisting on those changes. He feels insulted by some of the requests now, like the bathroom smell, and is frustrated about the takeout.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether that's correct. \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience heightened sensitivities, including to smells, which can cause nausea or vomiting. The author's wife asked him not to use the upstairs bathroom because the smell was bothering her. At the time, he complied, which makes sense as a supportive gesture. Now that she's no longer pregnant, maybe her sensitivity has lessened, but perhaps she's still dealing with postpartum issues or other reasons for the request.\n\nNext, the TV control. During pregnancy, maybe the wife had limited mobility or was housebound, so controlling the TV was a way for her to have some autonomy. Post-birth, if she's still recovering or dealing with postpartum fatigue, she might not have the energy to manage other activities, so TV could be a comfort. The author might be assuming she's back to her \"old self,\" but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nFood is another point. The author was buying takeout during the pregnancy, which might have been a way to accommodate her cravings or inability to cook. Now, after giving birth, if she's still relying on takeout, maybe she's not in a position to cook, especially if she's dealing with a newborn. The author's frustration with the budget is understandable, but the wife's needs postpartum might still require some adjustments. It's a time when both parents are adjusting, and support is crucial.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for going back to their old ways. The wife's requests during pregnancy were likely due to valid medical or emotional reasons. After birth, some of these might still apply, especially if she's recovering or dealing with postpartum depression or anxiety. The author's actions during pregnancy were supportive, but now he's reverting. However, the postpartum period can be challenging, and the wife might need continued support. \n\nBut does that mean the author is in the wrong? Or is it that the wife is now being unreasonable? It's a balance. The author is trying to return to what was normal before, which is natural, but the wife might still have valid reasons for wanting those changes. The key here is whether the requests are reasonable. The bathroom smell: if she's still sensitive, maybe due to some lingering issue, it's not insulting. The TV: if she's exhausted from caring for the baby, watching TV is her way to relax. Takeout: perhaps she can't cook as much now because of the baby, so the author's financial concerns need to be addressed through communication, not just reverting to old habits.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he's being insulted and that these changes are no longer necessary. However, the wife's experience postpartum is different, and her needs might still require accommodations. The author might be neglecting her ongoing needs, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But maybe the wife is not flexible, expecting continued changes that are no longer necessary. The T-A of it is whether the author's return to old ways is reasonable or if he's being dismissive of his wife's current situation.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the requests made during pregnancy were likely due to valid reasons, and the wife may still be in a state where those accommodations are helpful. The author's frustration is valid, but he might need to communicate and find a middle ground rather than unilaterally deciding to stop all accommodations. The wife's postpartum period is a critical time, and support is important. So AITA would probably say he's in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance. However, the way he phrases it as \"insulting\" and \"she can't go do\" might indicate a lack of empathy for her current situation, which would support answer A.\n"
