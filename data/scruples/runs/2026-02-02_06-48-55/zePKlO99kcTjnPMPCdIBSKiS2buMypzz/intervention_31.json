Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife had a baby.\n\nSo the author describes that during his wife's pregnancy, he made a lot of accommodations, like avoiding the upstairs bathroom and letting her have control of the TV. Now, after the birth, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting those same accommodations. He feels like she's being unreasonable now that the baby is born, like the bathroom smell is normal again, and he's upset about the restaurant expenses.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, during pregnancy, it's common for women to experience nausea and sensitivity to smells. So the author's willingness to adjust during that time is understandable and probably supportive. However, after birth, the physical needs of the mother might still be there, especially if she's recovering and caring for a newborn. But the author is now pushing back because the baby is here, and he's handling the baby watch. \n\nThe bathroom issue: The wife might still be sensitive to smells due to postpartum recovery, or maybe the baby's smell is different. The author's comment about her \"shit\" stinking is a bit crude and could be seen as dismissive. That might be a problem in terms of respect.\n\nTV control and takeout: The author mentions that during pregnancy, the wife watched a lot of TV because she couldn't do much else. Now, with a baby, maybe she's still dealing with postpartum recovery, fatigue, or needs downtime. If the author is taking over baby duty, maybe the wife needs rest, so her wanting to watch TV or have takeout could be a way to manage her energy. The author might be underestimating her ongoing needs or the stress of caring for a newborn.\n\nThe budget issue: If the author is handling the baby, maybe he expects the wife to manage her own meals. But the wife might be too tired or overwhelmed to cook, hence relying on takeout. The author's stance might not consider her current situation.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author might have a valid point about the budget, but the way he's approaching it without considering his wife's perspective could be the issue. Going back to old habits abruptly after a major life change like childbirth might not be considerate. The wife's needs might still be legitimate, even if they seem similar to pregnancy. The author's frustration is understandable, but expecting immediate return to pre-pregnancy norms without discussing it with his wife could be the problem.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's ongoing needs and the new dynamics of their life with a baby. His approach could be seen as dismissive of her postpartum experience, which is a significant adjustment. The way he's framing the issues (like the bathroom smell) could come off as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Considering the context of postpartum care and the importance of mutual support, the author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to adjust to the new situation, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. The initial answer might hinge on whether he communicated properly or considered her ongoing needs. Since the story doesn't mention communication, but he just went back to old ways, that's probably where the issue is. So, the answer is A.\n"
