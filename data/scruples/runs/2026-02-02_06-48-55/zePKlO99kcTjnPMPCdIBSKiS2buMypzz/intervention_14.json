Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. The situation involves the author complying with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her have control of the TV. Now, post-birth, he's reverting to his old ways and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, women often experience physical and emotional changes that can make them more sensitive. The author gave in to her requests out of love and consideration. After birth, the mother might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and adjusting to the new baby. She might feel that the accommodations were necessary for her health and well-being during pregnancy, so expecting them to continue could be natural.\n\nThe author's actions now might seem like a betrayal or lack of support. The examples given\u2014using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout\u2014are about daily life adjustments. The key issue is whether the author is wrong to stop these accommodations now that the wife isn't pregnant anymore. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, compromise is important. The author might feel entitled to his old habits, but the wife might still need some adjustments for the baby's sake or her own postpartum needs. There's also the aspect of communication. If the author didn't discuss these changes with her and just went back to old ways, that could be problematic. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is about fairness and budget, while the wife's perspective is about continuity and her needs. The question is whether the author's actions are unjust. Since the accommodations were specific to pregnancy, maybe it's reasonable to stop them after childbirth. However, the postpartum period is a critical time, and some adjustments might still be necessary for her recovery. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the original accommodations were time-bound. But he might have a responsibility to communicate and find a middle ground instead of abruptly reverting. However, based on the information given, the answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for not continuing the pregnancy-specific adjustments. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the circumstances changed, but there's a need for mutual discussion.\n"
