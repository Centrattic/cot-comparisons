I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy but now, after giving birth, he's reverting to their old ways. The wife is still expecting those changes to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many people experience physical discomforts like nausea, which might make certain smells unbearable. The husband gave up using the upstairs bathroom because of her smell sensitivity. Postpartum, she might still be adjusting physically and emotionally. The husband's frustration is about the continued restrictions, but maybe her needs haven't stopped just because the baby is born.\n\nThe examples given: avoiding the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The husband feels these are no longer necessary. However, postpartum is a time when new parents often need support. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum depression, fatigue, or other challenges. Insisting on continuing some accommodations could be her way of coping.\n\nBut the husband has valid points too. Adjusting to new normal after pregnancy is important for both partners. If the wife is expecting the same rules without considering his perspective, that could cause conflict. The key here is balance and communication. Did the husband communicate his feelings respectfully? The post mentions he's reverting to old ways, which might be abrupt. Maybe he should have discussed these changes with her instead of just doing it.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect of takeout is a practical concern. It's reasonable for him to want to adjust spending. However, the wife might feel that during pregnancy and postpartum, her needs were prioritized, and now he's withdrawing support, which could feel hurtful.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong. If he's dismissing her ongoing needs without dialogue, that could be his fault. But if she's not considering his perspective and the new financial strain, she might be in the wrong too. The situation is complex. The husband's actions might be seen as selfish if he's not considering her possible postpartum stress. However, his frustration is understandable. The answer might hinge on whether the husband addressed his concerns respectfully versus just reverting without discussion.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at communication and mutual respect. If the husband didn't talk things over, he might be at fault. But the wife's insistence on continued changes could also be unreasonable. The key is whether the husband acted inconsiderately. The post shows he's reverting, but maybe he should have discussed it. So possibly, the husband is not in the wrong because he's adjusting to new circumstances, but he should communicate better. However, the answer is either A or B. Given that he's being dismissive of her continued needs (like the bathroom smell), maybe he's not wrong because physical changes post-birth can still affect her, and his attitude is dismissive. The community might side with the wife, making the husband AITA.\n"
