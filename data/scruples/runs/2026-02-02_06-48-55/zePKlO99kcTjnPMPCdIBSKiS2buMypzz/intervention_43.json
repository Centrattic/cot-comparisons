Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a husband who made accommodations during his wife's pregnancy but is reverting to old ways after she gave birth. He's frustrated with things like the bathroom rule, TV control, and takeout expenses. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many people experience physical discomfort, like nausea or sensitivity to smells. The husband gave in to requests, which is common to support the pregnant partner. Now that the baby is here, he's changing his behavior again. \n\nThe key points are: the wife might still be dealing with postpartum issues, both physical and emotional. The husband's frustration is understandable, but he needs to consider her well-being. For example, the bathroom smell could still be an issue if she's recovering or has postpartum nausea. The TV control and takeout might be part of her adjusting to new responsibilities and stress. \n\nBut the husband is trying to return to normalcy. However, the transition after childbirth can be tough. Maybe the wife is still in a vulnerable state, and the sudden change in behavior could add stress. The husband should communicate openly with her to understand her needs and explain his side. It's about balance. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong. He's not wrong for wanting to return to normal, but he might be wrong if he's dismissing her needs without considering her current situation. The line between supporting her and expecting her to adjust is thin. The original accommodations were made out of love and support during pregnancy. Postpartum, similar consideration might still be necessary, even if the specific reasons have changed. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he's not considering that his wife might still need some adjustments. Or maybe B, since he's not entirely wrong to want to return to normal. But I think the key is that the husband should be empathetic and discuss things with her rather than unilaterally reverting to old ways. So, he's in the wrong because he's not considering her ongoing needs postpartum.\n"
