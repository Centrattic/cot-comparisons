Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, during the pregnancy, the husband gave in to many of his wife's requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now, postpartum, he's reverting to the old ways, which she's still expecting him to follow. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. The husband feels she's being unreasonable now that the pregnancy is over, while the wife might feel that her needs during pregnancy should still be respected post-birth.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the perspectives. The husband's actions during pregnancy were out of love and accommodation, but now he's trying to return to his previous behavior. However, the wife might still find those accommodations necessary for her comfort, especially postpartum when she's adjusting to new responsibilities. \n\nThe key point here is whether the husband's actions post-birth are dismissive of his wife's continued needs. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom might have been due to her sensitivity during pregnancy, but post-birth, she might still find the smell overwhelming, especially if she's dealing with postpartum recovery. Similarly, takeout food during pregnancy might have been due to morning sickness, but now she might still prefer it because managing meals with a newborn is difficult. \n\nThe husband's frustration about the budget and his desire to take over baby duty might be valid, but he needs to communicate this with empathy. The fact that he's taking over baby watch shows he's trying to share responsibilities, but the issue is the takeout and other accommodations. \n\nI think the husband is in the wrong because he's not considering that some of his wife's needs might still be relevant postpartum. Just because she's no longer pregnant doesn't mean she's not dealing with the physical and emotional challenges of caring for a newborn. The author might be dismissing her feelings without understanding that her needs are still legitimate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
