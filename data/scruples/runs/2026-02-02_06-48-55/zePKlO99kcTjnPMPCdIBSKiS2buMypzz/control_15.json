      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband made some accommodations during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV and order takeout. Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. During pregnancy, many people have specific needs or discomforts, and partners often make adjustments out of consideration. The husband did that, which is good. Now, after the baby is born, he's trying to go back to normal. But the wife is still expecting those changes, which is causing conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons for the wife's continued requests. The husband feels that some of the accommodations are no longer necessary. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell. The husband's point is that the smell is normal, and it's insulting to think her waste doesn't stink. That seems like a reasonable stance. However, maybe during pregnancy, the wife had a sensitive sense of smell, which is common, so the husband was accommodating a temporary issue.\n\nRegarding the TV: during pregnancy, the wife had limited mobility or energy, so she watched a lot. Now, after giving birth, she might still be recovering or dealing with postpartum fatigue. The husband is taking over baby duties, but maybe she's still struggling. If he's doing the baby watch, maybe she's not getting enough rest, so she still needs time to relax in front of the TV. But he's not willing to let her do that anymore, which could be a point of contention.\n\nFood is another issue. The husband ran out for takeout during pregnancy, but now it's hurting the budget. Postpartum, especially with a newborn, the wife might still have physical or emotional needs that require comfort food or easy meals. The husband might feel that the situation has changed, but the wife might see her needs as still valid because she's recovering and dealing with the baby.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for reverting. The wife's requests might not be as extreme as during pregnancy, but she's still in a vulnerable period. The husband's justification is that the temporary accommodations should be temporary. However, the transition back to normal might need to be adjusted. Maybe the wife hasn't fully recovered, or the new circumstances (raising a baby) require more support. \n\nIn many cases, after childbirth, the partner's support is crucial. The wife might be dealing with postpartum depression or anxiety, which can make daily tasks harder. If the husband is not considering her current state and is cutting back on support, that could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the accommodations were only meant for the pregnancy and the husband is just returning to their previous dynamics, maybe he's justified. \n\nBut the way the husband phrases it\u2014\"her shit doesn't stink\"\u2014could come off as dismissive of her needs during pregnancy. That might indicate a lack of empathy. Also, expecting her to adjust back immediately without considering her postpartum recovery could be the issue. So, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not recognizing that the postpartum period still requires some level of accommodation, even if the pregnancy itself is over. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's reverting to old habits without considering his wife's ongoing needs after childbirth.\n"
