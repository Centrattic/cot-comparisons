I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during her pregnancy, he made a lot of concessions, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that the baby was born, he's trying to revert to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea, heightened sense of smell, and fatigue. The husband accommodating these needs is common and shows support. The key issue here is whether it's reasonable to expect those accommodations to continue postpartum. \n\nThe wife might still be recovering, dealing with postpartum depression, or adjusting to life with a newborn. The husband is now feeling that the changes are no longer necessary, but the wife is holding onto them. The examples given\u2014like not using the bathroom, TV control, and takeout\u2014might be more about the wife's current needs versus the husband's desire to return to his old lifestyle.\n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The problem might be that he's dismissing the wife's current needs as \"insulting\" and not considering that she might still be struggling. The husband's frustration is understandable, but he might be failing to communicate or collaborate with his wife to find a balance. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh if the husband is being unreasonable. If he's abruptly reverting without considering his wife's postpartum challenges, that's a problem. However, if he's trying to restore some normalcy while the wife is still stuck in the pregnancy phase, there's a middle ground. The answer depends on whether the husband is being inconsiderate versus the wife being inflexible. \n\nIn many cases, postpartum is a time when new parents need more support. If the husband is not acknowledging that, he might be in the wrong. However, if the wife is being excessive and not adjusting, maybe she's the issue. The examples given don't show the husband being abusive, just trying to return to normal. But he should probably be more empathetic. \n\nHmm. The husband's frustration is valid, but he might be underestimating his wife's needs. The answer could be A (author in the wrong) because he's dismissing her needs post-birth, but maybe B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to regain his former life. I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the accommodations are needed now. If the wife is still unwell or struggling, the husband's pushback might be premature. \n\nOverall, the husband might not be entirely in the wrong, but he should approach this with more empathy and communication. However, the examples he gives don't necessarily show malice. The wife's insistence could be due to lingering needs. But the question is whether the author is wrong. If he's being dismissive of her postpartum experience, then maybe A. If he's just adjusting back, then B. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A because he's showing a lack of consideration for his wife's ongoing needs after childbirth, which is a significant life event. The husband is reverting without considering that the wife might still need support. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
