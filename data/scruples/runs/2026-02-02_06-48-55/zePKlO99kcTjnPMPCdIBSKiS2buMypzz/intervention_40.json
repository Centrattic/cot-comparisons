Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a husband who went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy but is now reverting to old habits, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many people experience physical discomforts like nausea or sensitivity to smells. The husband complied with requests like not using the upstairs bathroom, which makes sense out of consideration. Now, after the baby's birth, he's pushing back, feeling that the rules are no longer necessary.\n\nThe key points here are understanding and empathy. The wife might still be adjusting postpartum, dealing with recovery, fatigue, or other challenges. The husband's frustration with things like the bathroom, TV control, and takeout expenses is valid, but he needs to communicate this respectfully. The question is whether his actions are inconsiderate now.\n\nIf the wife is still struggling with postpartum issues, expecting her to immediately return to pre-pregnancy norms without discussion could be harsh. The husband should address these issues with empathy rather than dismissing her needs as \"insulting.\" For example, the bathroom comment might come off as dismissive of her past discomforts. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband has his own needs and the family's budget to consider. He's not in the wrong for wanting to adjust their routines, but the way he's expressing his frustration matters. The tone of his examples (calling her needs ridiculous, using a derogatory term like \"trashy reality shows\") suggests a lack of respect, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the husband's intentions might be valid, but his approach and attitude could be inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether his actions are seen as justified or dismissive. Since he's not considering her ongoing needs and is using a condescending tone, he might be in the wrong. However, if the wife is now being unreasonable without valid reasons, he's not entirely at fault. But given the context, the husband's approach likely lacks the necessary empathy and communication, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
