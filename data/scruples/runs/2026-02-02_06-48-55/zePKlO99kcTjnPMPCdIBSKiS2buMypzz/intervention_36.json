Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old habits after their wife gave birth, but the wife still expects the changes they made during her pregnancy. The author lists examples like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the author made accommodations because the wife was dealing with pregnancy-related issues like nausea and limited mobility. That makes sense\u2014people often adjust their behavior during pregnancy to support their partner. Now, post-birth, the author is trying to return to normal, but the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The author feels these are unreasonable now because the wife's needs have changed.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the changes were temporary and necessary during pregnancy. They argue that the wife's current demands are unreasonable, like the bathroom smell being an issue when it's normal, or expecting takeout which affects the budget. They feel they're being unfair by the wife to continue these practices after the pregnancy period.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might still be recovering from childbirth and dealing with postpartum challenges. She might not have the energy or ability to do things herself, or she might have developed habits that provide comfort during a stressful time. The author is now expecting her to adjust back to pre-pregnancy routines, which could be a source of stress for her.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong for not continuing the accommodations. The key here is whether the author's actions are dismissive of the wife's ongoing needs. While pregnancy is a temporary state, postpartum recovery can also be challenging. The author is reverting to old habits, which might not consider the wife's continued needs. For example, the bathroom issue might be more about sensitivity or discomfort than just smell, and the takeout could be due to lack of time or energy after caring for a newborn.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they adjusted a lot during pregnancy, but the transition back might require communication. Maybe the author should discuss these changes with their wife instead of abruptly reverting. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the accommodations were only meant for pregnancy and the wife is now being asked to adapt, but the author isn't being unreasonable in their own actions, it's a nuanced situation.\n\nBut the author is not just reverting; they're also dismissing the wife's continued requests. The bathroom smell example is a bit harsh\u2014calling it \"insulting\" and saying \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink\" is disrespectful. That's a clear point where the author is being dismissive and rude. Similarly, the food issue is about budget, but the wife might need the takeout for convenience or health reasons. The author not wanting to do it could add stress on her.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should communicate and find a balance. However, the author's actions here seem to prioritize their own comfort over the wife's needs, especially without considering if those needs are still valid postpartum. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because some accommodations were for a specific time. But the way they're handling it\u2014dismissing the wife's requests as ridiculous or insulting\u2014does indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're being dismissive and not considering the wife's ongoing needs postpartum, even though some accommodations were temporary. The way they're treating the wife's requests is disrespectful and not showing the support she might still need during recovery.\n"
