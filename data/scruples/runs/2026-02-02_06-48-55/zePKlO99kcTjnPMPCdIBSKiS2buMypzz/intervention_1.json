Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. So, the situation is that during her pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that the baby is born, he's reverting to the old ways, and she's upset. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: he's trying to go back to how things were before pregnancy, which he felt was reasonable. He feels that some of her requests during pregnancy were excessive, like the bathroom smell. Now, he's doing what he wants again, and she's still expecting those changes postpartum. He's also dealing with the financial strain of takeout.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that some of those changes are still necessary for her well-being or comfort. Maybe the bathroom issue was about sensitivity during pregnancy, and now she's still dealing with postpartum recovery, so the smell might still be an issue. Also, she might be adjusting to the new baby and need more support, like help with food and taking turns with the baby.\n\nThe author might be right in that some of the requests during pregnancy were temporary, but maybe the wife is still in a vulnerable state postpartum. The line between being accommodating and being taken advantage of is blurry here. The author might be right to want to balance things, but going back abruptly could be seen as dismissive. The key is communication and mutual understanding. If the author didn't talk to her about the changes and just reverted, that could be the issue. But if they discussed it and she's still resistant, maybe the wife is overstepping. However, given the context of postpartum, which can bring physical and emotional challenges, the wife's needs might still be valid. The author's point about the budget is a practical concern. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but the way he's handling it could be better. The answer hinges on whether the changes are necessary postpartum and how both parties are communicating. Since the wife is still expecting some changes, the author might not be in the wrong if those changes aren't necessary, but he should approach it with empathy. Hmm, but the bathroom smell example is more about reality\u2014everyone's poop smells. So maybe the author is right not to comply with that. But the control of the TV and takeout might be different. The wife might be struggling with postpartum and needing more support. The author might be right to want boundaries, but maybe the way he's enforcing them is hurtful. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for discussion. But maybe the wife's needs postpartum are more important, making the author wrong. I'm a bit torn. The initial answer the user thinks is A, but maybe B is correct. The key is whether the changes are reasonable postpartum. If the wife is still struggling, the author should be accommodating. If not, then reverting is okay. The examples given are about things that might not be necessary anymore. So, B.\n"
