I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that after his wife gave birth, he started going back to their old ways, but she's still expecting the changes he made during her pregnancy. The user is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to adjust their behavior to accommodate the pregnant person's needs, which can include things like avoiding certain smells or giving up control of the TV. These changes are often made out of love and support for the pregnant person's comfort and well-being. The author did this, which is understandable.\n\nNow, after the birth, the author is reverting to their normal habits. The wife, however, is still expecting those accommodations. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell. The author finds it insulting now, which might be because the pregnancy-related nausea has passed. But the smell of the bathroom is a real issue; bodily functions do have odors, so maybe the wife is still sensitive or just used to the accommodation. \n\nAnother point is the TV and food. During pregnancy, the wife might have had limited mobility or energy, so having the TV on her terms made sense. Postpartum, she might still be adjusting to the new normal, caring for the baby, and perhaps still needs some level of comfort. The author is now pushing back because these accommodations are affecting the budget and his ability to help with the baby.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to balance household responsibilities and financial stability, but he should have discussed this with his wife instead of just reverting. The wife's expectations might be based on her current state postpartum, which can involve physical and emotional changes, fatigue, and the stress of caring for a newborn. \n\nHowever, the author's frustration is valid. It's reasonable to want to adjust expectations after the initial period of pregnancy. But the way he's handling it\u2014like thinking the smell is insulting\u2014might come off as dismissive. The wife might feel that her needs are still valid during the postpartum period. \n\nIn relationships, mutual understanding and compromise are important. If the author didn't communicate his concerns and just went back to old habits, that could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the wife isn't acknowledging that some accommodations aren't necessary anymore, that could be an issue too. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but the way he's approaching the situation could be problematic. The answer might be B (No), but it's a bit of a grey area. The main point is that both parties need to communicate better. The author's actions alone might not make him wrong, especially if they're adjusting to new dynamics, but his approach could be improved.\n"
