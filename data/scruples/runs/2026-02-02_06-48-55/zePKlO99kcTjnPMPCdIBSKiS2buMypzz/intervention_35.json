Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user asked if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy but is now reverting to old habits after giving birth. The wife is still expecting him to follow those habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, it's common for people to have specific needs due to physical discomfort or health reasons. The husband complied with those requests, which might have been necessary for her well-being. After the birth, those same requests might not be as necessary, but the wife is still expecting them. \n\nThe husband feels that some of the requests are unreasonable now. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell. During pregnancy, maybe the smell affected her nausea, but after birth, it's just a normal bathroom. The husband is frustrated because he's having to adjust again. Then there's the TV and takeout. The husband gave in during pregnancy, but now he wants to set boundaries.\n\nThe wife might feel that the changes she requested were necessary to be comfortable during pregnancy and that she's still adjusting to motherhood, so she might need some reassurance. The husband, on the other hand, is dealing with his own stress from coming home to take care of the baby and not wanting to handle additional requests like takeout.\n\nI need to think about communication. Did the husband talk to his wife about these changes? If he just went back to old ways without discussing, that could be the issue. Maybe the wife needs more support postpartum, and the husband isn't recognizing that. Alternatively, the husband might be overextending himself and needs to set boundaries.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he was accommodating during pregnancy, which was appropriate. Now, after the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal. However, the way he's handling it might be abrupt. If he didn't communicate his feelings, that could be a problem. The wife might be in a vulnerable postpartum state and still need care. The husband's frustration is valid, but he needs to approach it with empathy.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his needs, or B (not in the wrong) because he's entitled to his own boundaries. The key here is whether his actions are respectful and considerate. The husband's actions might come off as dismissive of his wife's needs postpartum, which could be an issue. But if he's trying to balance his own needs and the baby's needs, that's understandable. The question is whether his approach is wrong. The husband might be right to set boundaries but needs to do it in a way that's respectful and collaborative. If he's unilaterally changing without discussion, that's a problem. The examples he gives (bathroom, TV, takeout) might be reasonable to revisit, but the approach matters. So maybe the husband is not entirely at fault, but he could handle it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to decide. Given that the wife is still adjusting postpartum and the husband is reverting without considering her perspective, maybe the husband is in the wrong (A). Alternatively, if the husband's actions are reasonable, then B. It's a bit of a gray area. The husband's frustration is valid, but the wife's postpartum needs might require more accommodation. The husband's actions could be seen as not considering her ongoing needs. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
