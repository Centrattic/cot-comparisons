Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who changed his behavior during his wife's pregnancy to accommodate her needs, but after she gave birth, he's going back to his old ways, and she's still expecting those changes. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, during pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make certain things worse for the expectant parent. The author gave in to many requests, which is common and even encouraged to support their partner. But now, postpartum, the author is reverting. The wife might still be adjusting physically and emotionally, and expecting some accommodations might be reasonable.\n\nLooking at the examples given: the bathroom issue. During pregnancy, maybe the smell was more intense for her due to nausea, so avoiding the upstairs bathroom made sense. Now, she might still be sensitive, or maybe the author's use of the upstairs bathroom causes stress. The author is now using the \"it's just normal\" argument, but maybe she's not back to her usual state yet. It's possible that the smell is still bothering her, even if it seems trivial to him.\n\nThe TV control issue: during pregnancy, she had more time to watch shows because she was less active. Postpartum, with a new baby, maybe she's still recovering and needs downtime. The author might be taking control of the TV, which could be a source of stress for her if she feels her preferences aren't respected anymore.\n\nFood is another point. The wife might have been less mobile or had less energy during pregnancy, so takeout made sense. Now, with the baby, she might still be dealing with sleep deprivation and physical recovery, making it hard to cook. The author is cutting back on takeout, which could be a financial decision, but it might be adding to her stress if she's not in a position to cook yet.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he's under stress from taking over baby duties and the financial strain. He feels he's doing his part, and reverting to old habits is just returning to normal. However, the wife might still be in a vulnerable state postpartum, needing support. The key here is whether the author is acknowledging her ongoing needs or just dismissing them because the pregnancy is over.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't discuss these changes with his wife and just went back to his old ways, that's a problem. He should have talked about the budget and bathroom issues to find a compromise. The fact that he's using phrases like \"it's just insulting\" and \"her shit doesn't stink\" shows a lack of empathy. He's making a judgment about her feelings rather than considering that her needs might still be valid.\n\nSo, while the author has valid points about the financial burden and his own stress, the way he's dismissing his wife's continued needs without discussion suggests he's not considering her perspective. Postpartum is a time when support is crucial, and reverting to old ways without communication can be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not actively addressing the situation with empathy and collaboration.\n"
