Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he accommodated many of her requests, which he found ridiculous but did anyway. Now, post-birth, he's going back to normal, but his wife is still expecting those same accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can bring physical discomfort and emotional changes, so the wife's requests might have been due to genuine needs, like sensitivity to smells. The author's willingness to comply during pregnancy shows consideration. Now, after giving birth, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can be physically and emotionally taxing. It's possible that she's not just being stubborn but might still need some support.\n\nThe examples given include not using the upstairs bathroom, controlling the TV, and takeout food. The author feels these are unreasonable now, but the wife might have continued needs. For instance, postpartum, some women might still be sensitive to smells or need more rest. Controlling the TV could be her way of managing stress or finding a moment to relax. Takeout might be about not having the energy to cook after caring for the baby.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's reverting to old ways, which is fair, but maybe he should communicate better. He might be assuming his wife's needs have returned to normal, but she might still need support. The key here is mutual understanding and finding a middle ground. If he just goes back to his old habits without discussion, it could be dismissive of her ongoing needs. However, if he's open to negotiation while setting boundaries, that's different.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because the wife is still adjusting. The author's behavior could be seen as not considering her postpartum state. But then again, the author is also dealing with baby duty and budget concerns. The answer might hinge on how both parties are handling communication. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but the author's approach might be too abrupt without checking in with his wife's current situation. So, the answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances.\n"
