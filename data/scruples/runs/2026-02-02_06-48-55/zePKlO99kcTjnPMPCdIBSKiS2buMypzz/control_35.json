Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The situation is that during pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, but now after the baby is born, he's reverting to his old habits, and she's still expecting the changes to continue. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author feels that during pregnancy, he made sacrifices like avoiding the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to go back to normal, but his wife is still enforcing those changes. He finds some of them unreasonable now, like the bathroom smell and takeout being a budget issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her needs during pregnancy and postpartum are still important. Maybe she's dealing with postpartum recovery, stress from caring for the baby, or health issues. The bathroom issue could be about comfort or hygiene, which might still be relevant. The takeout might be because she's physically unable to cook or prefers not to during recovery. The TV control could be a way for her to relax or cope with the stress of new motherhood.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is justified in reverting to old ways. During pregnancy, he made concessions out of love and consideration. However, after the baby is born, the wife's needs might still be significant. Postpartum recovery can be physically and emotionally demanding. The author might be expecting the adjustments to end, but the wife might see them as necessary for her well-being during this period.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially regarding the budget and personal space. But it's important to consider that new parents often face stress and that communication is crucial. If the wife is still sensitive to smells (like bathroom odors), it's not about her poop not stinking but perhaps about her sensitivity or the baby's presence. The takeout issue could be a matter of her not having the energy to cook or the baby needing to be fed.\n\nThe author is trying to balance his own needs with his wife's. However, reverting completely to old habits without discussing it might be seen as dismissive of her ongoing needs. It's possible that the wife is still adjusting, and expecting her to go back to pre-pregnancy routines might be unrealistic. The author might need to communicate better, find a middle ground, and consider that some adjustments might be necessary for longer than just the pregnancy period.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering his wife's current state and needs. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. The author could be seen as not supporting his wife adequately postpartum, which is a critical time. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering that some of the changes might still be necessary for his wife's well-being during postpartum recovery.\n"
