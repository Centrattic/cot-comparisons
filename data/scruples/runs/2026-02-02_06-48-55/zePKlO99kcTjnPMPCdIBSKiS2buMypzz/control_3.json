I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The question is about returning to old habits after their wife gave birth. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband says he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even the ridiculous ones. Now that the baby was born, he's going back to normal, but she's still expecting the same changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her have control of the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual understanding and communication in a relationship. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to accommodate each other's needs due to physical and emotional changes. But after the birth, the wife might still feel that those accommodations were necessary, especially if she's dealing with postpartum challenges.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that some of these changes are no longer justified now that the baby is born. For example, the bathroom smell issue isn't new, and he's tired of not using it. The TV control and takeout might be seen as things that were temporary, but she's expecting them to continue. He feels it's affecting the budget and his personal habits.\n\nBut from the wife's perspective, she might be dealing with the stress of a new baby, maybe postpartum depression or anxiety, and the changes helped her during pregnancy. She might see these as necessary for her well-being even after birth. If she's still recovering physically, maybe the takeout wasn't just about convenience but about her being able to rest and focus on the baby.\n\nThe husband might not be in the wrong because he's trying to return to normal after a period of adjustment. However, the way he's handling it could be problematic. If he's not communicating his feelings and just going back to old ways without considering her feelings, that's where the issue lies. The key here is whether there's been open communication. If he hasn't discussed these changes with her and is just acting on them, that could hurt her feelings and make her feel her needs aren't being considered.\n\nBut if he's approached her and they're having a discussion, maybe they can find a compromise. The problem might be that he's not seeing her perspective. For example, the bathroom issue: she might have been sensitive during pregnancy, but after birth, maybe she's still dealing with postpartum sensitivity or the baby's needs, so the smell is a bigger issue now. He might not realize that.\n\nThe takeout issue is about budget and personal responsibility. If she's used to having takeout during pregnancy, maybe she's not in a position to cook now because of the baby. So expecting him to still handle that might be reasonable. The husband might need to find a middle ground, like cooking together or finding a cheaper alternative.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to adjust and communicate. If he's reverting without considering her current situation, he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to communicate and they're just disagreeing, it's more of a mutual adjustment problem. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by going back completely without considering her ongoing needs. The examples he gives don't sound entirely unreasonable, but the way he's dismissing her needs might be the issue. Saying \"her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does.\" is dismissive and could be hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her continued needs and is being dismissive. However, if the wife isn't adjusting at all and he's trying to find balance, then maybe he's not. But given the way he's phrased it, it seems he's not engaging in the necessary communication, hence he's in the wrong.\n"
