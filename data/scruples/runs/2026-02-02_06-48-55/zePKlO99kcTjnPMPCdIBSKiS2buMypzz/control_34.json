I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The context is that he went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, and now she's still expecting the changes he made during her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. During her pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout. Now, after the baby is born, he's reverting to his old habits, and the wife is upset. \n\nHe feels like some of her requests were ridiculous and that he shouldn't have to continue them post-pregnancy. For example, the bathroom smell was an issue during pregnancy because she was feeling sick, but now he's finding it annoying. The TV control and takeout are also points of contention.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer needs to be either A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. On one hand, he made accommodations during her pregnancy because she was unwell. Now that she's not pregnant anymore, he's justified in not continuing those changes. On the other hand, maybe the wife is still recovering or has postpartum needs that require some adjustments. The bathroom issue might be about her sensitivity after childbirth, not just during pregnancy. The TV control could be part of managing her stress or helping with the baby's environment. Takeout might be because she's busy with the newborn and can't cook.\n\nBut he argues that some of these were ridiculous. The bathroom smell is a common issue, but maybe during pregnancy, she was more sensitive. Now, he's frustrated because he's handling baby duty and shouldn't have to run out for food. However, postpartum is a time when new parents often need more support. Maybe the wife is still adjusting and the husband is reverting too quickly without considering her ongoing needs.\n\nBut the user is asking if he's wrong. If he's trying to return to normal, but she's still in a postpartum state, perhaps he should be more understanding. However, he's also justified in not continuing everything. The balance is tricky. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, often the middle ground is expected. The husband might be in the right if he's trying to find a balance, but if he's being dismissive of her postpartum needs, he's wrong. The bathroom example: if she's still sensitive, but he's ignoring that. The TV control could be about her needing downtime. The takeout is about budget and effort.\n\nSo, maybe the husband is in the right to push back on some things but not all. The answer depends on whether he's being unreasonable. The original requests were made during pregnancy, but if she's still struggling postpartum, some accommodations might still be needed. However, he's not in the wrong for wanting to adjust things. The wife might need to communicate better. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to return to normal after accommodating her during pregnancy. However, he should communicate and find a middle ground. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
