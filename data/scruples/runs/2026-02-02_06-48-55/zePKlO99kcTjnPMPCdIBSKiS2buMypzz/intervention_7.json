I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that after his wife gave birth, he went back to his old ways, but she's still expecting him to maintain the changes he made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband made a lot of accommodations during pregnancy, like avoiding using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, post-birth, he's trying to revert to their old habits, which she's not okay with. The wife might feel that those accommodations were necessary even after the birth, maybe for health or recovery reasons. The husband thinks it's unreasonable now, like the bathroom smell isn't a big deal anymore.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about expectations postpartum. The wife might be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can be physically and emotionally challenging. She might need more support during this time. The husband is trying to return to normal, but maybe the wife needs more help, especially with tasks like taking care of the baby and managing household responsibilities.\n\nThe food issue: the husband is upset about running out for takeout. That could be a financial strain, but during pregnancy, maybe the wife had mobility issues or nausea, so takeout was easier. Post-birth, she might still have trouble cooking due to recovery. The husband taking over baby duty is good, but expecting him to handle her meals might be a point of contention.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for reverting. From a relationship standpoint, communication is key. If the husband didn't discuss the changes with his wife, that's a problem. The wife might feel her needs are being ignored now that she's postpartum. However, the husband's perspective is that some accommodations were temporary and not necessary anymore.\n\nBut postpartum is a critical time where the mother might need more support. The husband might be overlooking her ongoing needs. The bathroom issue: maybe the smell is still a problem because she's recovering, or maybe she's more sensitive now. The control of the TV could be a way for her to relax and cope with the stress of new motherhood. The food issue could be about her needing meals she can eat quickly or that are easier on her postpartum body.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's needs during recovery are important. The key here is whether the husband considered her perspective and communicated about these changes. If he made unilateral decisions to revert without considering her ongoing needs, that's where he might be in the wrong. The wife might feel that the support she received during pregnancy is now being withdrawn when she needs it more.\n\nBut on the other hand, the husband is trying to balance financial concerns and his own needs. However, new parents often face financial pressures, and compromising is necessary. The husband's actions might be seen as not supporting his wife adequately during her recovery, which is a crucial time. So, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong because he's not considering her postpartum needs and communication was lacking.\n"
