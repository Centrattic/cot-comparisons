Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went back to his old ways after the birth of their child, and the wife is still expecting the accommodations he made during her pregnancy. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the husband made some concessions, which is common for partners to do. After the baby was born, he stopped those concessions, but the wife still wants them. The husband feels it's unreasonable now, like the bathroom smell shouldn't be ignored, the TV control is a normal thing to fight over, and takeout is affecting the budget.\n\nBut wait, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and adjusting to a new baby. Maybe she's still feeling stressed or overwhelmed. The husband is taking over baby duty, so maybe he's balancing things out. However, the accommodations during pregnancy were out of consideration for her comfort. Now that the baby is born, maybe she still needs some support, but perhaps not the same as during pregnancy.\n\nThe husband's arguments: he's dealing with the bathroom smell, which is a real issue. TV control is a shared resource, so maybe it's reasonable to expect sharing again. Takeout is expensive, so cutting that back makes sense for the budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be feeling that her needs are not being met, or that the husband is reverting to old habits. There could be a communication issue here. Maybe the husband didn't set boundaries or explain why he's reverting, leading to confusion or hurt feelings.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, during pregnancy, he made sacrifices, which is typical. After the baby is born, it's natural to expect some changes in routine. However, the wife might still need some support, especially with a newborn. The husband could be more empathetic, perhaps discussing these changes with her instead of just going back to the old ways. Communication is key here. If he's abrupt in his changes, that could be seen as dismissive of her needs postpartum.\n\nBut the examples given\u2014like not using the upstairs bathroom\u2014are things that might have been temporary during pregnancy. The wife's expecting those same conditions postpartum might be unreasonable, as the situation has changed. The husband is entitled to his own preferences now, especially if the accommodations were temporary. However, if the wife is still struggling with postpartum issues, maybe some flexibility is needed.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a balance. If he's just going back to normal without considering her current situation, maybe. But if she's expecting the same accommodations as during pregnancy without valid reasons, then he's not in the wrong. The key is communication and mutual understanding. Since the husband is trying to balance the budget and his own comfort, and the wife is insisting on past changes without valid postpartum needs, the husband might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
