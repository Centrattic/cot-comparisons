I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. He feels like she's being unreasonable now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be a time when a woman's body and emotions are really sensitive. Morning sickness, hormonal changes, and other physical discomforts might make certain requests more understandable. The author complied during pregnancy out of love and caring, which is good. But after the baby was born, he's trying to revert to normal, which might be a natural reaction. However, maybe his wife is still dealing with postpartum recovery, sleep deprivation, or other challenges that make her want to maintain some of those accommodations.\n\nLooking at the examples he gave: the bathroom smell. He says she was fine with it during pregnancy but now it's an issue. Maybe after giving birth, she's more tired and sensitive, or maybe the baby is around, and she's concerned about germs or the baby's comfort. The TV control\u2014during pregnancy, she had limited mobility, so controlling the TV was a way to feel in control. Now, with the baby, maybe she still needs that time to relax. Takeout\u2014maybe after childbirth, her appetite is different, or she's not able to cook as much, so relying on takeout helps her manage.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's trying to balance his own needs and the new baby's needs. But the key point is whether his actions are dismissive of his wife's current needs. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not continuing to accommodate her past requests. \n\nOn one hand, he's entitled to his own comfort and the budget. On the other, the postpartum period is a critical time for the mother, and some adjustments might still be necessary for her well-being. If he's reverting without considering her ongoing needs, that could be problematic. Also, the way he describes the situations\u2014like \"her shit doesn't stink\"\u2014might come across as dismissive or lacking empathy, which could hurt his wife's feelings.\n\nBut maybe the author is just trying to return to normalcy after the intense period of pregnancy and birth. It's a balance. The answer might depend on whether there's mutual communication. If he's not communicating his reasons and she's still in need, then he might be in the wrong. However, if communication is open and they're adjusting together, it's a shared responsibility.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to manage his own life and the new baby's needs. However, he might be missing the point that some changes are necessary postpartum, not just during pregnancy. The initial accommodations were out of care, and continuing them might still be part of supporting his wife during recovery. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he's expressing a desire to revert while she's still expecting it, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), because the adjustment period postpartum can be complex, and both partners need to communicate and find a middle ground. However, his tone and some of his statements might show a lack of understanding, which could tip it the other way. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because he's not considering that his wife might still need some support postpartum, and his actions could be seen as dismissive of her ongoing needs. But I'm a bit torn here. Alternatively, if the wife is being unreasonable and not considering the budget or his exhaustion, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is whether his actions are justified in the context of mutual respect and communication. The question doesn't provide info on their communication, so it's hard to say. But based on the information given, the author's frustration is valid, but his approach might lack empathy. So maybe A or B? \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to adjust back, and the wife's continued expectations might be unrealistic. However, if the wife's needs are still valid postpartum, then he might be. But since the question is from his perspective, and he's explaining his reasoning, the answer might lean towards B. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe A because he's not considering that some needs persist. I'm confused. Let me check again.\n\nThe initial requests were during pregnancy, which is a temporary condition. Postpartum is also a temporary period but with different needs. If the wife is still needing some of those things, maybe it's reasonable for the author to comply. But if it's been a few months (since the baby was born in October), maybe she should be returning to normal. However, some postpartum issues can last longer. Without more context, it's tricky. Given the information, the author's actions are within his rights, so B.\n"
