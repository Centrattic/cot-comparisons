I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author changing their behavior back to normal after the birth of their daughter, but the wife is still expecting some of the pregnancy-era accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the examples given. The first one is about not using the upstairs bathroom because the smell was too much for the wife when she was pregnant. Now, the author feels it's insulting because the smell does exist. The second example is about the wife having control of the TV during pregnancy, which the author now resents. The third is about takeout orders affecting the budget, and the author not wanting to continue that.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Let's think about the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to accommodate physical discomforts, even if they seem trivial. The author did so willingly during the pregnancy. Now, after the birth, the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The author is pushing back, which is understandable since the reasons (pregnancy-related issues) no longer apply.\n\nBut wait, maybe the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues. Maybe she's exhausted, has postpartum depression, or other challenges that make her need those things. The author is changing back to old habits, but the wife might not be the same person anymore. However, the author's resentment could be valid if the accommodations are no longer necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made those changes out of love and consideration during a vulnerable time. Now, expecting the wife to let go of those accommodations might be reasonable, but the wife's insistence could be due to lingering physical or emotional issues. The key here is whether the author's actions are inconsiderate now that the circumstances have changed.\n\nThe examples given are about things that were temporary during pregnancy. The smell issue was temporary. TV control was during a time when the wife couldn't do much. Food delivery was for her comfort during pregnancy. Now, the author is reverting, but the wife is still expecting them. The author's frustration with the budget is a valid concern.\n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated better. Maybe instead of just going back, they could have discussed these changes post-birth. The author might be right in wanting to adjust, but the way it's being handled could be the issue. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the accommodations were necessary during pregnancy and the author complied, then post-pregnancy, those might not be necessary. But the wife's insistence could be due to her new role as a mother being stressful. The author is trying to balance the budget and shared responsibilities. The wife might be using pregnancy-era habits as a way to cope with new stresses. However, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting some changes, especially if the reasons no longer apply. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if the author is being inconsiderate now. The author is reverting to old habits, which the wife might still find necessary. Maybe the wife is struggling with postpartum, and the author isn't supporting her as before. That could make the author in the wrong. Alternatively, the author is justified in adjusting. This is a bit of a toss-up. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the changed circumstances. Since the original accommodations were for the wife's health during pregnancy, now that she's not pregnant, it's reasonable to adjust. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
