Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband adjusting his behavior post-pregnancy and postpartum.\n\nFirst, during pregnancy, the wife had specific requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell. The husband complied, which is understandable as pregnancy can cause nausea and sensitivity. Now, after giving birth, he's reverting to old habits. The wife still wants him to follow those changes. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The husband might feel that the pregnancy-specific accommodations aren't needed anymore, but the wife might still be dealing with postpartum challenges. It's important to consider her physical and emotional state post-birth. Hormonal changes can affect her sensitivity and moods. Also, the reality TV example shows he gave up control of the TV during pregnancy, which she now expects to continue. Maybe she's not used to being around the baby yet or is handling stress through watching shows. \n\nRegarding food, he's concerned about the budget. However, postpartum nutrition is crucial for recovery and breastfeeding. If she's relying on takeout, maybe she's not able to cook, or it's part of her self-care. The husband taking over baby watch when he gets home is good, but not acknowledging her need for other comforts might be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe husband's frustration is valid, but he should approach the situation with empathy. It's possible he's not considering that some needs might persist postpartum. The answer depends on whether the wife's continued requests are reasonable. If they're still within the realm of postpartum care, the husband might be in the wrong for not maintaining support. But if the wife is being unreasonable, maybe not. However, the examples given (smell sensitivity, TV control, food) are often common during postpartum. The husband should communicate and find a balance rather than abruptly reverting to old ways without discussion. So, the answer is A.\n"
