That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves him going back to old habits after his wife gave birth, which she's not okay with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband says he was accommodating during his wife's pregnancy, even with some unreasonable requests. Now, post-birth, he's reverting, and she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and taking care of takeout. He feels these are unfair now because she's not pregnant anymore, and it's affecting their budget and his routine.\n\nHis wife's perspective isn't directly stated, but the implication is that she's still adhering to her previous requests. The key here is whether the husband is justified in changing his behavior or if he's being inconsiderate. \n\nDuring pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make certain things more sensitive. For instance, the bathroom smell might have been more intense for her then. Similarly, TV control might have been a way for her to cope with limited mobility. Postpartum, she might still be dealing with the stress of a new baby, making it hard to adjust back to old norms.\n\nThe husband's argument is that the pregnancy is over, so those accommodations shouldn't be necessary anymore. However, it's possible that his wife is still adjusting to motherhood and relies on those changes for comfort. The financial aspect with takeout is also a point\u2014maybe she's not aware of the budget impact or feels entitled to it now.\n\nBut the husband is also trying to balance his responsibilities. Taking care of the baby at home, he might feel overburdened. The question is whether his actions are dismissive of his wife's needs or if he's just trying to return to a normal routine.\n\nI need to consider if the husband is being inconsiderate by ignoring the ongoing needs of his wife. It's possible that she's still experiencing postpartum issues or anxiety, making those changes necessary. Alternatively, maybe she's being unreasonable by not adjusting to the new normal.\n\nThe line between reasonable accommodation and being taken advantage of is blurry here. The husband might be in the right if the accommodations were only needed during pregnancy. But if the wife still needs them for her well-being postpartum, then he might be the asshole by not continuing.\n\nAlso, communication is key. If they haven't discussed this openly, that's part of the problem. The husband might feel wronged if she's not compromising, but maybe he should be more empathetic. However, he's also balancing his own needs and the household.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. But given that the accommodations were during pregnancy, and the husband is trying to return to normal, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, if the wife still needs them for her mental health postpartum, he might be. The answer could lean towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) but with the caveat that open communication is needed.\n"
