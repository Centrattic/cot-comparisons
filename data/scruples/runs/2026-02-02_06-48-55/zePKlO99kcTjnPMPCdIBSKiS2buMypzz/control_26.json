Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband made a lot of concessions during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting her takeout. Now, after the baby was born, he's going back to his old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. The husband feels that some of these things are unnecessary now, like the bathroom smell and the takeout affecting the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each point. Let's break down the examples. The bathroom issue: during pregnancy, the wife couldn't handle the smell, so the husband avoided using it. Postpartum, he thinks it's insulting because the smell is normal. But maybe the wife is still sensitive after childbirth? Or maybe she's dealing with postpartum stress, so the smell might still be a trigger. The husband's reaction might be dismissive of her needs, even after she's had a significant life event.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, he let her watch whatever, but now he's taking over. Maybe the wife has been isolated during pregnancy and still needs some comfort from watching TV. Or maybe she's still adjusting to being a new mother and needs some downtime. Taking that away could be seen as withdrawing support she's come to rely on during a vulnerable time.\n\nFood issue: The takeout during pregnancy was a temporary adjustment. Postpartum, the husband is concerned about the budget. However, the wife might be struggling with postpartum exhaustion and the adjustment to caring for a newborn. Maybe she's used to having that convenience and now feels deprived. The husband could be not considering her emotional state or the physical demands of postpartum recovery.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's returning to normal, but the wife is still in a different phase. The key here is whether the adjustments he made were temporary or if they need to be reconsidered postpartum. It's possible that some accommodations should continue, especially if they contribute to the wife's well-being. The husband might be in the wrong if he's dismissing her needs without understanding the ongoing challenges she's facing. However, if the wife is being unreasonable, then maybe not. But the examples given don't show the wife's perspective, so it's hard to say. The husband's dismissive attitude (\"her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does\") might be seen as disrespectful, contributing to the problem. So, overall, the husband might be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough postpartum.\n"
