I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after she gave birth, he's going back to their old ways, and she's still expecting those changes to continue. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea and sensitivity to smells, so avoiding the upstairs bathroom might have been necessary for her comfort. Now that the baby is born, the author feels it's unreasonable to keep avoiding that bathroom. But maybe she still has sensitivities? Or maybe it's more about habit or convenience now?\n\nThen there's the TV control issue. The author gave up control during pregnancy because she couldn't do much else. Now that she's not pregnant, he's taking back control, but she's still expecting to watch her shows. Is that about fairness or about her still needing some space? Maybe she's adjusting to motherhood and still needs downtime?\n\nThe food part is about takeout. The author is upset about the budget and not wanting to keep running out for food. But maybe she's dealing with the stress of caring for a newborn and the takeout was a way to manage that. Now, with the baby's schedule, maybe they need to adjust together.\n\nI think the key here is communication. The author made changes during pregnancy out of love and support, but after the baby's birth, maybe both parties need to discuss what's reasonable now. The author might feel entitled to revert back, but perhaps the wife still needs some accommodations postpartum. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. The author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to balance things, but maybe he's not being empathetic enough to her ongoing needs. Alternatively, if the wife hasn't communicated clearly, the author might not know that she still expects those changes. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions are considered reasonable given the new circumstances. If he's being reasonable and the wife is now overstepping, then he's not in the wrong. But if the wife's needs are still valid and he's dismissing them, then maybe he is. However, from the description, the author seems to think the changes are no longer necessary, so I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's adjusting after a period of accommodating his wife's pregnancy needs.\n"
