I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to her various requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now that their daughter was born, he's going back to his old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. The husband is frustrated with things like using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze each point. The wife requested not to use the upstairs bathroom during pregnancy because the smell was too much. Postpartum, she's still enforcing this. The husband finds it insulting. But maybe during pregnancy, the smell was a real issue due to nausea or sensitivity, so he complied. Now, after birth, maybe her sensitivity has lessened, or she's just set in her ways.\n\nTV control: He let her watch reality shows during pregnancy because she couldn't do much else. Now, postpartum, he wants to take over. The wife might still need rest, especially with a newborn. Maybe she's not able to engage as much in other activities, hence still relying on the TV.\n\nTakeout food: He stopped driving for takeout during pregnancy, but now she's expecting it again. The husband is concerned about the budget. Maybe she's not aware of the financial impact, or she's still adjusting to her new role and not thinking about the costs.\n\nNext, considering the dynamics. Pregnancy can lead to significant physical and emotional changes. The wife might be dealing with postpartum depression or anxiety, which could make her more reliant on routines or comforts. The husband's return to old habits might feel like a rejection or lack of support. However, the husband did comply with her requests during pregnancy, which shows he was considerate. Now, he's trying to adjust back to normal, which is understandable given his perspective.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From his side, he's trying to regain his autonomy and manage the household more practically. From her perspective, she might feel that the needs during and after pregnancy are ongoing, especially with a newborn. The key is communication. Did he and his wife discuss these changes postpartum? If he just went back to old ways without talking to her, that could be an issue. If there's been a lack of communication, that's a problem for both sides.\n\nBut according to the description, the author says he started going back to old normal, implying he didn't check in with her. He might be dismissing her ongoing needs, which could be valid. For example, postpartum recovery can be tough, and some needs might persist. The bathroom issue: maybe she's still sensitive, or the baby's in the house, so she's avoiding going up? Not sure. The husband's frustration is understandable, but he might need to consider her perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The husband isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to adjust, but if he's not considering her continued needs or not communicating, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that he gave in during pregnancy shows he was willing to make sacrifices, but now he's pushing back. However, postpartum is a different phase where some needs might still be relevant. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband's actions are reasonable. Using the bathroom is a basic need; maybe she's not overly sensitive anymore. But he's using words like \"insulting\" and \"her shit doesn't stink,\" which could come off as dismissive. The takeout issue is about budget, but she might be struggling with adjusting to motherhood and needing comfort foods. \n\nOverall, I think the husband is in a tricky spot, but if he's not communicating and is dismissive of her needs, he might be in the wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be A or B. Given that he's trying to reclaim his habits, but the wife's needs might still be valid, perhaps the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but he needs to communicate better. However, the way he's framing his frustration might make him in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nWait, the initial answer options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no. Considering that he's being dismissive of her ongoing postpartum needs (which can be real and significant), he might be in the wrong. But if those needs have passed, maybe not. The example about the bathroom smell: maybe she's still sensitive, but he's judging her. The husband's actions could be seen as not considering her continued challenges. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because he's trying to return to normal after making sacrifices during pregnancy. But without proper communication, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the key is that he's reverting without considering her current situation. Postpartum is a time when many women need continued support. So the husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, hence A. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B because he's adjusting back, but the way he's doing it (calling her smell \"insulting\") is problematic. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
