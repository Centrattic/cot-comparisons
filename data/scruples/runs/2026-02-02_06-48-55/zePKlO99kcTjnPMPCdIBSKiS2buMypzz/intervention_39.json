Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after their wife gave birth, but the wife is still expecting the changes they made during pregnancy. The author is frustrated because things like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout are now causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the author's behavior. During pregnancy, they gave in to their wife's requests, which they found ridiculous but did it out of love and consideration. Now, after the baby is born, the author is reverting to their old habits, which the wife is not happy about. The author feels that the wife's continued insistence on these changes is unreasonable, especially since the pregnancy symptoms have passed.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author might feel that they adjusted during pregnancy, but after the baby was born, they expected things to go back to normal. However, the wife might see those changes as necessary for her well-being during pregnancy and perhaps still relevant postpartum. For example, the bathroom issue could be about nausea or sensitivity lingering even after birth. The TV control might be a way for her to unwind, and takeout could be due to postpartum fatigue or caring for the baby.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the issue is whether they communicated their needs and expectations after the baby was born. If they just reverted without discussing their feelings, that could be problematic. On the other hand, the wife's demands might be excessive if the original reasons (like pregnancy symptoms) no longer apply. However, postpartum recovery can have its own challenges, so some adjustments might still be needed.\n\nThe author's tone is dismissive, especially phrases like \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does.\" This could come off as disrespectful, which might contribute to the conflict. The wife's perspective isn't fully explained, so there might be valid reasons she's holding onto these changes. The author needs to consider whether these were temporary adjustments during a difficult time, and now it's time to find a middle ground.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author didn't discuss the changes postpartum and just stopped complying, that could be seen as inconsiderate. They should have talked about their feelings instead of acting unilaterally. However, if the wife was being unreasonable, that's a different angle. The question is whether the author is wrong for not maintaining those changes without discussion. The answer might hinge on communication. If the author didn't talk to the wife about their stance, they might be in the wrong. But if they tried and the wife was still insistent, the blame might shift.\n"
