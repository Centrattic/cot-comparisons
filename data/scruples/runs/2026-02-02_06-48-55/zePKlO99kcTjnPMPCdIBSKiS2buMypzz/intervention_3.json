I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, but she's still expecting him to stick with the changes he made during her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says he loved his wife and gave in to her requests during pregnancy, even if some were ridiculous. Now, after the baby was born in October, he's trying to return to normal, but she's still expecting him to follow those same rules. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving her control of the TV, and taking out orders for takeout. He feels these are unreasonable now and are hurting the budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that some of these accommodations were necessary for her comfort during pregnancy and she's still adjusting postpartum. Maybe she's dealing with postpartum stress or physical discomfort, making it hard to let go of those habits. Also, with a newborn, there's a lot of stress, and she might feel that the changes helped her cope during pregnancy and still need them now.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the smell of the bathroom is a normal thing, and he shouldn't have to avoid it. The TV control example is about her having limited activities during pregnancy, so she had time to watch shows. Now, after giving birth, maybe she's working or has more responsibilities, so she still needs that downtime. The food issue is about budget strain, but maybe she's used to the takeout and finds it easier with the baby around.\n\nI should think about the balance between respecting her needs and setting boundaries. It's possible that the author is being reasonable in wanting to return to normal, but he should also consider her perspective. Maybe some of these changes are still important for her mental health or recovery. If he's dismissive, that could cause tension. However, if he's willing to communicate and find a compromise, that might be better.\n\nAnother angle is that during pregnancy, people often have specific needs, and it's common for partners to make sacrifices. But after the birth, those needs might change. The key is communication. Did he talk to her about his feelings and try to negotiate? If he just went back to his old ways without discussion, that could be the problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong now.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her continued needs postpartum. Maybe some of the changes were temporary but she still needs them. However, if she's not willing to adjust, there's a balance to strike. But since the author is the one who is enforcing his old ways without compromise, maybe he's at fault. Alternatively, if she's being unreasonable in expecting the same accommodations, he's in the right. But given the context, it's more likely that the author needs to be more empathetic and find a middle ground. So perhaps the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
