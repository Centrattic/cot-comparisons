Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong after going back to old ways post-birth. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author complied with his wife's requests during pregnancy, even if some were \"ridiculous.\" Now, after the baby is born, he's reverting to old habits. The wife still expects those changes to stay. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and food orders.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong. Let's consider the context. During pregnancy, the wife might have had valid reasons\u2014like nausea or sensitivity to smells. The author was accommodating, which is good. Now, after birth, the author feels the changes shouldn't be permanent. But the wife is still dealing with postpartum recovery, possibly stress, and the new demands of a baby.\n\nThe author's arguments: using the upstairs bathroom is now \"insulting,\" controlling TV is unfair, and takeout is a budget issue. But the wife's needs might still be legitimate. For example, the bathroom might be harder to access for her if she's recovering, or she might be overwhelmed with the baby and need some downtime with the TV. The takeout could be part of her adjusting to being a new mom, needing more energy.\n\nThe author is reverting without considering that some accommodations might still be necessary. He might not realize that postpartum is a different phase than pregnancy. His tone seems dismissive, like he's annoyed. The wife's needs might not be about control but about managing her new role and recovery.\n\nHowever, the author's point about the budget is valid. Maybe they need to communicate and find a balance. But the key is whether he's in the wrong. If he's ignoring her ongoing needs without discussion, that's an issue. The author should approach this with empathy, not just revert to old behaviors because he's frustrated.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not considering that some changes might still be necessary postpartum and is dismissing his wife's ongoing needs. He should communicate and adjust rather than revert without discussion.\n"
