I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The story is about a husband who made accommodations during his wife's pregnancy but now, after giving birth, he's going back to their old ways, which she's not happy with.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband gave in to many of her requests during pregnancy, which is common. Postpartum, he's reverting to normal, but she's still expecting those changes. The examples given are not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and takeout food. The husband feels insulted and it's affecting the budget.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband was accommodating during a time when the wife was feeling unwell, which is considerate. Now, after her pregnancy, expecting her to maintain those same accommodations might be unrealistic. However, the husband is now refusing to do them, which could be seen as going back on his word. The wife might feel that her needs are still valid, especially with the new baby. For example, not wanting the bathroom smell might be about her comfort, and takeout could be because she's busy with the baby.\n\nBut on the other hand, the husband is right that pregnancy and postpartum are different. Some accommodations might not be necessary anymore. The key here is communication. If the husband didn't talk about his feelings and just stopped doing things, that's a problem. However, the examples he gives seem like they are more about personal preferences. Like the bathroom smell\u2014maybe it's not the same issue when she's not pregnant. Or the TV control\u2014maybe they need to negotiate now that there's a baby involved.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for not continuing to do things he found unreasonable? Maybe not entirely. But if he didn't discuss it with her and just went back to his old ways, that's a problem. The AITA forums often look at whether the person communicated their feelings. The husband didn't mention discussing these things with his wife, just that he's going back to normal. That could be where he's in the wrong. He should have talked to her about his feelings and found a compromise instead of abruptly changing his behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a new baby, the wife might be more stressed and in need of support. The husband's actions could be seen as dismissive of her postpartum needs. Even if some accommodations were unreasonable, there's a balance between his needs and hers. He might need to adjust some things for the baby's sake too, like not leaving the baby to go get takeout. So maybe the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for going back to old ways without communication. I think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings and just reverted without considering her ongoing needs.\n"
