      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during her pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even some that he found ridiculous. Now that the baby was born in October, he's trying to return to their previous normal, but she's still expecting those accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can cause physical and emotional changes in women. Nausea, heightened sensitivity to smells, and fatigue are common. The author adjusted his behavior, like avoiding the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV, to support her during that time. Postpartum, the mother might still be dealing with recovery, stress, or even postpartum depression. \n\nThe author's examples include the bathroom issue. He says he stopped using the upstairs bathroom because of her sensitivity to smells, but now he's frustrated because he thinks her waste does have an odor. That seems like a reasonable adjustment during pregnancy, but maybe there's a compromise they could make now, like using air fresheners or cleaning more. \n\nThe TV control and takeout are other points. During pregnancy, he was accommodating, but now he's pulling back. The wife might feel that these adjustments were necessary for her well-being and that they should continue for her recovery. The author is concerned about the budget and his own time. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author might be assuming that the changes were temporary, but the wife might see them as part of the new normal. It's possible that she's still dealing with physical or emotional needs postpartum. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might come across as dismissive of her experiences. \n\nHowever, the author is also trying to balance household responsibilities and financial concerns. He's taking over baby duty, so maybe he expects her to share in the other tasks. The question is whether his return to old habits is inconsiderate or if the wife is overstepping by expecting continued changes. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be in the right to want some normalcy, but his tone could be seen as dismissive. For example, saying \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\" is pretty harsh. That could be perceived as disrespectful. On the other hand, the wife's expectations might be unreasonable if she's not considering his perspective or the financial impact. \n\nI think the issue is more about the communication and approach rather than the actions themselves. If the author can discuss these issues with empathy and find middle ground, they might resolve it. But based on the current information, the author's frustration is understandable, but his phrasing and the examples he gives might put him in the wrong for not showing enough consideration for his wife's postpartum needs. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
