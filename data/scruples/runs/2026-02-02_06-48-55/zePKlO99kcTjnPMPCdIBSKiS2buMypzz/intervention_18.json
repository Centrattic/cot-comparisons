      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he complied with many of her requests, even if they were ridiculous. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to revert to their previous habits, but the wife is still expecting those changes to stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be a physically and emotionally challenging time for women. Morning sickness, nausea, and other symptoms are common, which might explain why the wife asked for things like not using the upstairs bathroom. The smell of the bathroom might have actually triggered her nausea, so the author complied. Now, after giving birth, she's still expecting those accommodations. But the author feels that some of these are no longer necessary and are affecting the household dynamics, like the budget and his ability to relax.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's actions are justified. He's trying to return to normal, but the wife is still clinging to pregnancy-era changes. The examples given\u2014bathroom use, TV control, and takeout\u2014are all things that might have been temporary adjustments during pregnancy. The author argues that these are no longer needed, and the wife's insistence is making him feel like he's in the wrong.\n\nHowever, postpartum can be a stressful time for both parents. The wife might still be dealing with recovery, sleep deprivation, and adjusting to a new baby. It's possible that her requests during pregnancy were not just for her comfort but also to manage stress. If the author is now reverting without considering her ongoing needs, that could be seen as dismissive. For example, the bathroom issue might still be about avoiding triggers if she's sensitive postpartum. Also, TV control during pregnancy might have been a way for her to cope, and if she's still overwhelmed with the new baby, she might need that space.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns about the budget and his own needs. He's taking over baby duty, which is a big responsibility, and the takeout requests might be adding unnecessary financial strain. The bathroom smell might be a matter of perspective\u2014what was a smell during pregnancy might not be the same now. The TV control could be a power dynamic issue, where the author feels his autonomy is being restricted.\n\nIt's important to balance both perspectives. The author's compliance during pregnancy was appropriate as a gesture of support. Now, it's about adjusting to a new normal. The wife's continued insistence might be holding onto habits out of comfort or stress, while the author is trying to find a middle ground. The question is whether the author is wrong for asserting his boundaries. In relationships, compromise is essential. If the author is being unreasonable by not considering her feelings, he's in the wrong. If he's just seeking a fair balance, then maybe not.\n\nLooking at the examples, the bathroom issue is about a smell that was a problem during pregnancy but not now. The TV control could be a way for the wife to relax, especially with a new baby. The takeout budget is a practical concern. The author is trying to adjust, but maybe the way he's communicating his needs is causing the conflict. The wife might feel that her needs aren't being respected. The author's tone, particularly the \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink\" comment, might come off as dismissive, which could hurt her feelings. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author is trying to find a balance, but his approach might be contributing to the conflict. The wife might need some time to adjust, and the author could be more empathetic. Alternatively, the wife might not realize that her continued demands are unreasonable. The key is mutual understanding and communication. Without that, it's hard to say who's entirely right or wrong. However, the author's actions are within his rights to adjust after a temporary period, but his method of doing so might be where the issue lies. So, depending on the perspective, he could be in the wrong if he's not considering her ongoing needs postpartum.\n"
