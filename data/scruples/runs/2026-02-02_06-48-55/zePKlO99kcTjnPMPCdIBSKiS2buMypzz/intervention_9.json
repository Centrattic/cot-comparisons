Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. \n\nFirst, during the pregnancy, the author complied with his wife's requests, even if they seemed unreasonable. Now, postpartum, he's going back to his old ways and the wife is upset. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. The author feels these changes were temporary and now they should return to normal.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the wife was adjusting to a major life event, pregnancy, and postpartum. Her requests might have been due to her physical and emotional state. The author accommodating her during that time was a kind gesture. However, after the baby is born, the dynamics naturally change. The author feels that the restrictions are no longer necessary and it's affecting his lifestyle and the budget.\n\nBut the wife might still be dealing with postpartum challenges. The bathroom issue could relate to her sensitivity or the baby's environment. TV control could be her way of coping with limited mobility. Takeout might be about her needing rest and not having the energy to cook. The author's expectations might not align with her needs during this adjustment period.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's trying to return to his previous habits, which might not consider his wife's ongoing needs. However, he's also entitled to his own comfort. The key here is communication. If both parties didn't discuss these changes and expectations after the baby was born, then perhaps both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author. If he's not communicating his feelings and just reverting without discussion, that could be the issue. However, the examples he gives do seem reasonable. For instance, using the upstairs bathroom shouldn't be an issue unless there's a specific reason. Similarly, the takeout is affecting the budget, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut considering the wife's perspective, postpartum can be a vulnerable time. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive of her needs. The line between being accommodating and being taken advantage of can be blurry. If the wife hasn't discussed why she still needs these changes, maybe she's struggling and the author isn't aware. Alternatively, maybe she's expecting continued accommodation without realizing the author's boundaries.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the answer hinges on empathy and communication. The author didn't mention discussing these changes with his wife. He just reverted, which could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, he's also trying to maintain his household and budget. This is a tough balance. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's continued needs postpartum. However, the wife might also have a responsibility to communicate her needs better. But since the question is about the author, the answer would likely be A (yes, in the wrong) because he didn't address the situation with empathy and communication, instead reverting without discussing it with his wife.\n"
