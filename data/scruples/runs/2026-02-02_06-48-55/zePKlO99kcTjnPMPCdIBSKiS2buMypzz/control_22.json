I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says he loved his wife and during her pregnancy, he gave in to her requests even if they were ridiculous. Now that their daughter was born in October, he's trying to go back to their old normal, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout which affects the budget. He feels insulted and it's hurting their finances.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break this down. During pregnancy, he made concessions, which is common for partners to support each other. After birth, he wants to revert to old habits. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum challenges. Maybe she's more sensitive or needs extra care. But he's pushing back because he feels these things are unreasonable now.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. Did he talk to his wife about his feelings? The problem might be that he just went back to old ways without discussing it with her. If he didn't communicate, that could be an issue. Also, after childbirth, women often have physical and emotional needs. The bathroom issue might relate to her comfort, maybe she's still adjusting. The TV control could be her way of coping with stress or fatigue. Takeout might be because she's exhausted and can't cook.\n\nOn the other hand, he's justified in feeling that some things are unfair. The smell of the bathroom is normal, and he shouldn't have to go out for takeout if it's affecting the budget. But maybe there's a middle ground. The problem is whether he's wrong for reverting without considering her perspective. If he didn't discuss this with her, then he might be in the wrong. It's about how they handle the transition post-pregnancy. Both partners need to adjust and communicate. So the answer might depend on whether he communicated his needs or just acted on them. If he didn't, then he's at fault. If he did and she's still not compromising, maybe she's at fault. But based on the information given, he hasn't mentioned communication, so maybe he's wrong for not addressing it properly. So the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he went back without discussing it with her, assuming she should just accept the changes. Alternatively, if the wife is being unreasonable, maybe he's not. But the question is about his fault. Since he's the one who stopped the concessions without talking, that's probably where the issue lies. So answer A.\n"
