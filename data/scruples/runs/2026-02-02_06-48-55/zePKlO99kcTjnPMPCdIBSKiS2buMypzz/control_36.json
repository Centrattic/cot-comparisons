Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after going back to old ways post-birth. The situation involves the husband adjusting his behavior during pregnancy but now reverting, causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband gave in to his wife's requests during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and giving her control of the TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's stopping these practices, and the wife is upset. The husband feels it's unreasonable now, especially since the wife's preferences are now affecting the budget with takeout requests.\n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The husband's actions during pregnancy were accommodating, which is common and often encouraged to support the pregnant partner. However, after the baby's birth, he's reverting. The wife might be struggling with the physical and emotional changes postpartum, and the sudden change in behavior could be stressful. \n\nFrom a relational perspective, communication is key. The husband might not be in the wrong if he's trying to reestablish normal routines, but he should consider how his actions affect his wife. The wife's control issues and the takeout problem are valid concerns for the husband. However, the way he's framing it (like \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink\") could be seen as dismissive, which might hurt the wife's feelings. \n\nIt's a balance between mutual respect and compromise. The husband's needs are valid too, especially regarding the budget and shared responsibilities. But the wife might still be adjusting herself. So, maybe the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but the situation requires empathy from both sides. The question is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer would depend on whether the actions are justified. \n\nSince he was accommodating during pregnancy and now is trying to adjust back, but in a way that might be abrupt, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the fact that he's now trying to balance household responsibilities and budget might support that he's not entirely wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. The wife's perspective is also important; if she's still in a vulnerable state, pushing back too quickly might not be supportive. The husband's comments about the bathroom smell and TV control could be seen as insensitive, which might tip the scale towards him being in the wrong. But the user is asking for a yes or no. \n\nHmm. I think the key is whether the husband is in the wrong for reverting. If the wife is still adjusting postpartum, maybe the husband should maintain some of the accommodations temporarily. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's needs might still require some flexibility. The answer could be A (Yes) if he's not considering her ongoing needs, or B (No) if it's reasonable to adjust after pregnancy. But the question is from the husband's perspective. \n\nLooking at the original post, the husband is trying to explain his position. The community might view him as not being in the wrong because he's trying to return to their normal, especially if the wife's requests are excessive. However, the wife's adjustment period post-birth is a factor. The answer is likely B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. The husband's actions are about restoring balance, but the wife's needs are valid post-birth. Maybe the answer is B, but it's a close call.\n"
