I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, went along with her requests even when he found some of them ridiculous. Now, after the birth, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes. The husband is frustrated with things like not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and buying takeout. He feels these are unreasonable now and wants to revert to their normal habits. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband adapted his behavior during pregnancy to accommodate his wife's needs, which is common and usually seen as supportive. However, after the birth, he's trying to return to his previous habits. The key here is the transition period postpartum. The wife might still be dealing with physical and emotional changes, and the adjustments made during pregnancy might have become part of the new routine for her. \n\nThe husband's frustration is valid because he feels he's compromising his own needs and the household budget. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. He gave into her requests during pregnancy, which he now feels were unnecessary, but perhaps she needed those accommodations for her well-being at that time. Now, expecting her to revert without discussion might be abrupt. \n\nThe wife might be struggling with the return to her husband's old habits, especially if she's still recovering or dealing with postpartum issues. The husband's approach might come across as dismissive of her ongoing needs, even if they seem trivial now. For example, the bathroom issue might not be about the smell but about her feeling more comfortable or less stressed. Similarly, the TV control and takeout could be about her needing downtime or comfort after childbirth.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to manage the household budget and his own time. It's important for couples to communicate and find a balance. If he's not discussing these changes with her but just implementing them, that could be the issue. The wife might feel that her needs are being ignored after all the adjustments she's made. \n\nThe answer hinges on mutual understanding and communication. If the husband is not engaging in dialogue but reverting without considering her current situation, he might be in the wrong. However, if he's trying to adjust after a period of extreme accommodation, there's a case for his perspective as well. But generally, the expectations during and after pregnancy can be significant, and the husband's sudden return to old ways without considering her ongoing needs could be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, considering the balance, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not communicating and is dismissing her needs. The answer is A.\n"
