I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who made accommodations during his wife's pregnancy but is now reverting to his old ways after she gave birth. He's facing resistance from his wife on these issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. During pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, even the \"ridiculous\" ones. Now, postpartum, he's going back to normal, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout for her. He feels these are unreasonable now, especially with budget and practicality concerns.\n\nHe mentions that the bathroom smell is a real issue, which he dealt with during pregnancy but now finds insulting. The TV control is another point\u2014she's home more with the baby, so she wants to watch shows. Food is a financial strain because he's running out for takeout again.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship dynamics perspective, communication is key. During pregnancy, he made sacrifices. Postpartum, maybe expectations have shifted. The wife might feel that some accommodations are still necessary for her recovery or mental health. The husband might feel that the pregnancy phase is over, so he's returning to his habits.\n\nI should consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he was accommodating during a time when she needed it, and now he's trying to balance things. The wife's perspective is that some needs might still be relevant, especially postpartum, which can be a challenging time. \n\nHowever, the husband's frustration is valid if he's feeling like he's compromising too much now. The bathroom example: he's not wrong to find the smell an issue. The food budget is a practical concern. Maybe there's a middle ground. But is he in the wrong for wanting to revert? It depends on whether the wife's current needs are legitimate postpartum considerations. \n\nIf the wife is still struggling postpartum, she might need some support. However, the husband shouldn't be expected to maintain all the accommodations indefinitely. The key is communication and negotiation. If he's not communicating his feelings and she's not explaining her needs, both might be at fault. But the question is about the husband's wrongness. If he's just trying to find balance, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's dismissing her needs without understanding, then he could be partly at fault. \n\nBut given the examples, like the bathroom smell and the takeout, these are practical issues. The husband's stance that the smell is real and the budget is hurt might make him not in the wrong. The wife should communicate her needs clearly. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but there's room for compromise. However, the AITA context usually looks for who is primarily at fault. Since he's the one adjusting after making sacrifices, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being dismissive of her ongoing needs, maybe he is. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B, but it's nuanced.\n"
