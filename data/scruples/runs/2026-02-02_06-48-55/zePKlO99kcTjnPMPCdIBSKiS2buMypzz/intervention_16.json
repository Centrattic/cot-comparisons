Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who made accommodations during his wife's pregnancy, but after she gave birth, he's reverting to old habits, which she's resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, women often experience physical discomforts like nausea, sensitivity to smells, and fatigue. The husband gave in to her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her have the TV and takeout. Those seem like reasonable adjustments to make her more comfortable during a time when she's dealing with a lot.\n\nNow, after the birth, the husband is trying to go back to normal, but the wife still expects some of those accommodations. The key here is whether the husband's actions post-birth are unreasonable. For example, the bathroom issue: the smell might have been a problem during pregnancy due to her sensitive stomach, but now, after giving birth, it's just about normal bathroom smells. The husband finds it insulting, but maybe she's still adjusting postpartum, dealing with her own changes. \n\nThe TV situation: during pregnancy, she was restricted in her activities, so having the TV was a way to pass time. Now, after birth, maybe she's still dealing with postpartum recovery, less energy, or the baby's schedule affects their TV time. The husband taking over baby watching might mean he expects her to handle other chores, but if she's still recovering, she might not have the energy to switch tasks.\n\nFood: running out for takeout during pregnancy could be about her not wanting to cook due to nausea or lack of energy. Post-birth, she might still be dealing with fatigue and the demands of a newborn, so expecting her to cook might be unrealistic. The husband is concerned about the budget, but maybe the wife needs the convenience more than before.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's needs during and after pregnancy are significant. The accommodations made during pregnancy were to support her health and well-being. After giving birth, there's a transition period where both partners need to adjust. The husband might be expecting things to return to \"normal\" quickly, but postpartum recovery and caring for a newborn are major life changes that can require ongoing support. \n\nHowever, it's also important that the husband communicates his feelings and they find a balanced solution. If the wife is still insistent on the same accommodations without considering his side, there might be a lack of communication. But the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. His actions of going back to old ways might be seen as not acknowledging the ongoing needs postpartum. So, he might be in the wrong if he's dismissing her valid needs, especially if she's still dealing with physical or emotional challenges from pregnancy and childbirth.\n"
