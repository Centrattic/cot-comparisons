Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a relationship where one partner (the author) owes the other \u20ac3,000. The girlfriend won \u20ac100,000 and the author asked if she could forgive the debt or part of it. The response from the girlfriend was harsh, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author borrowed \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend out of necessity when his car broke down. He's been making efforts to repay her, even cutting back on expenses. When she won a large sum, he asked if she could relieve him of the debt. The girlfriend's reaction was defensive and disrespectful, but the main question is about the author's actions.\n\nThe author's request isn't framed as a demand but as a question, and he wasn't expecting anything. However, in relationships, asking for forgiveness of debt can be sensitive. It's important to consider the context of their financial agreement initially. If they had a clear agreement that the \u20ac3,000 was a loan to be repaid, then the author's request might come off as expecting a favor that wasn't promised. On the other hand, if the initial loan was meant to be a gift, then the repayment efforts might be unnecessary.\n\nThe author's defense using percentages (3% of her winnings vs. his sacrifices) might have come across as trying to quantify the relationship in monetary terms, which could be offensive. People have different values around money, and the girlfriend's response indicates that she views the debt as a boundary she's not willing to cross, even with her winnings. The way he rationalized his actions could have made her feel criticized for her financial decisions.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't communicate his financial struggles upfront. He mentioned making sacrifices to repay her, but he didn't share these with her before the request. This lack of communication might have contributed to the misunderstanding. The girlfriend felt disrespected, which is a valid emotional reaction. The author's approach might have been too confrontational after her initial refusal, leading to escalation.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's possible he overstepped by using the comparison of percentages and his sacrifices to justify the request. Even if the request itself wasn't unreasonable, the way he explained it after her refusal might have been unkind. However, the girlfriend's response was also harsh, which complicates things. The question is whether the author's actions were at fault.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's request wasn't inherently wrong, but his approach in defending his position after the refusal could have been handled more sensitively. The main issue is how he communicated his justification, which might have made the situation worse. So, there's a case that he's partially at fault for not considering her feelings enough in his response after being denied.\n"
