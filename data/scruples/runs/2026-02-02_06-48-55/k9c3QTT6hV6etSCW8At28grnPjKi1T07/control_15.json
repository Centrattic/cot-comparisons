Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their partner to help with a debt after she won a raffle. \n\nFirst, the context: The author, a 20-year-old guy, borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend (19) to fix his car. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs on food, etc. Now, she won 100,000\u20ac and he asked her to forgive the debt or part of it. She laughed, said no, and made a comment that hurt him. Now they're not talking.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. So, the key points here: \n\n1. The debt was a loan from the girlfriend. So, if it's a loan, there's an expectation of repayment. But the girlfriend was the one who offered the money in the first place. Maybe they didn't set clear terms? The author was in a financial bind, and she helped, which he's grateful for. \n\n2. The author is now asking her to forgive the debt after she's come into a large sum. The question is whether that's a reasonable request. The debt is 3k out of 100k, which is 3%. But the girlfriend's reaction was harsh. The author feels disrespected because she laughed and said things like \"I'm not someone like you.\" \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, asking to have a debt forgiven isn't inherently wrong. If it's a loan, the terms might affect that. If the loan was agreed to be paid back, then asking to have it forgiven could be seen as breaking that agreement. However, if the loan was given without clear terms, maybe the situation is different. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She might feel that the author is trying to take advantage of her good fortune. But her response was disrespectful, which is a problem. The author's actions of trying to pay back by cutting his own costs show he's made efforts, which is commendable. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that 3k is a small part of her windfall, and he's been sacrificing a lot. But perhaps he should have communicated his situation better before making the request. Or maybe he shouldn't have framed it as a demand, even if he wasn't expecting an answer. \n\nBut the core issue is whether asking to have a debt forgiven is wrong. If the loan was intended to be paid back regardless, then the author could be in the wrong. However, if the loan was a favor without strict terms, then the request is more understandable. \n\nThe answer likely depends on the initial agreement. Since the story doesn't mention any specific terms, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend was the one who gave the money, and the author is just asking for a gesture of goodwill given her new financial situation. The problem is the way she responded, not necessarily the request itself. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). However, the author's approach to rationalizing the request by bringing up his sacrifices might have come across as accusatory, which could have escalated things. But the main issue is her reaction, not necessarily the request itself.\n"
