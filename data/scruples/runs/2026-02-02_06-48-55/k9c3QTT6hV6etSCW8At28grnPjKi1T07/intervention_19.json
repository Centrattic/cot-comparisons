Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they asked their girlfriend to forgive a debt after she won 100,000\u20ac. The author had borrowed 3,000\u20ac to fix their car and had been trying to pay it back by cutting expenses. Now, the girlfriend is upset when the author asks for debt relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a tough spot financially, spent all their savings, and the girlfriend lent them the money. Then, when she wins a large sum, he asks if she can forgive the debt. The key points here are whether the request was reasonable and if the way he approached it was respectful.\n\nThe author's argument is that the 3,000\u20ac is a small percentage (3%) of her winnings and that he's been making sacrifices to pay it back. However, the girlfriend's reaction was defensive and hurt. She mentioned that she didn't want to draw a line on money, which might indicate that she has boundaries she didn't want to cross. The phrase \"I'm just not someone like you\" suggests that there's a misunderstanding or miscommunication about each other's values regarding money.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, financial matters can be sensitive. The author might have assumed that the debt could be forgiven because the girlfriend suddenly had more money, but that's her money, and unless there was a prior agreement, she isn't obligated to do so. The author's approach of asking for debt relief could be seen as taking advantage of her good fortune, even if he didn't expect it. The way he tried to rationalize it by comparing his sacrifices might have come off as guilt-tripping or implying that his efforts were more significant than hers, which could explain her defensive reaction.\n\nThe author's actions: He asked for something he wasn't supposed to expect, and then he brought up the sacrifices he made when she said no. That could have made the situation worse. The girlfriend's response was harsh, but her right to say no is valid. The question is whether the author overstepped by making the request and then justifying it by highlighting his efforts. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author probably shouldn't have made the request in the first place if he wasn't expecting it, as he acknowledges. Then, when she declined, bringing up the math and his sacrifices might have been unproductive. The girlfriend's anger and cold response could be a result of feeling disrespected or pressured. So while the author's intention was to seek help, the approach and the subsequent justification might have been inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the request, even if not expected, could be seen as taking advantage, and the way he handled the refusal was confrontational. However, some might argue that the girlfriend's reaction was harsher. But the question is about the author's actions, not hers. The key issue is his approach to the request and how he followed up when she said no.\n"
