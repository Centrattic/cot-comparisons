Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend. He borrowed 3,000\u20ac from her when he had a car problem. Now she's won 100,000\u20ac and he asked her to forgive the debt. She got upset, laughed at him, and said things that hurt his feelings. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to ask.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He borrowed the money, which implies an agreement to pay it back. The question is whether asking her to forgive the debt after she came into a windfall is unreasonable. \n\nHe mentioned that he's been making efforts to pay her back by cutting his expenses. That shows he's trying to fulfill his part of the agreement. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have given the money as a loan, not a gift. If she had intended to give it as a gift, maybe she would have said so. But since he's been paying her back, she might have expected him to continue.\n\nHowever, when she won a large sum, he asked her to write off the debt. The user is asking if that's a reasonable request. From a financial perspective, 3,000\u20ac is a small percentage of her 100,000\u20ac win. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. She laughed at him and made a comment implying that he's different from her. That's not respectful. \n\nBut the author's approach might have been too confrontational. He tried to justify his request by listing all the things he's done for her, which could come off as a guilt trip. Instead of just asking, he might have made her feel like she wasn't contributing enough. That could have escalated the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he had a loan and was trying to pay it back. Asking for forgiveness after a significant win might be reasonable. On the other hand, the way he framed his request, using his sacrifices to justify it, might have been the trigger for her anger. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was definitely harsh and disrespectful, but the author's method of approaching the request might have contributed to the conflict. He might not have been in the wrong for making the request, but his communication approach could have been better. However, the girlfriend's reaction was more about the manner of the request rather than the request itself. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author's action of asking for forgiveness isn't necessarily wrong, but how he did it and the subsequent argument might place some responsibility on him. But the main issue here is her response, which was inappropriate. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he made the request, which might be seen as crossing a line, depending on the nature of their agreement. \n\nAlternatively, if the money was a loan, he's obligated to pay it back. She isn't required to forgive it, even after winning money. So asking for forgiveness isn't necessarily wrong, but expecting her to do so could be. The problem is he asked, but her response was extreme. \n\nHmm. The key point is that the author borrowed the money. If it was a loan, then it's his responsibility to pay it back. The girlfriend isn't obligated to forgive the debt, even if she has the means. So the author's request might be considered inconsiderate because he's asking her to undo a financial agreement. \n\nBut given that she might have given the money expecting he'd pay it back, and he's been making payments. Now that she has more money, he's asking her to cancel the rest. The ethical perspective here is complex. \n\nIn many relationships, financial matters are sensitive. The author might have assumed that her winning the money changes the terms of their agreement, but that's not necessarily fair. The debt should have been handled according to their original agreement. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for expecting her to forgive the debt after the fact. Even though it's a small amount for her, the nature of the loan was a mutual agreement. He should have considered that she might have given the loan with the expectation of repayment. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's asking to change the terms of a financial agreement after the fact without mutual consent, and his approach might have been guilt-tripping.\n"
