Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (m20) borrowed \u20ac3000 from his girlfriend (19) to fix his car. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, which is taking a toll on him. Now, when she wins \u20ac100,000, he asks her to forgive the debt, or part of it. She reacts negatively, says some hurtful things, and they end up fighting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a tough spot financially and needed help. His girlfriend lent him the money, which he's been struggling to repay. When she wins a raffle, he sees an opportunity to get relief on the debt. The question is whether asking for forgiveness of the debt is reasonable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that \u20ac3000 is 3% of her winnings. He's been sacrificing a lot to pay her back, like eating cheap meals. He didn't expect her to forgive the debt entirely, but when she dismissed his request angrily, he felt disrespected. He tried to explain his side, which led to her calling him an a**hole and breaking off communication.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, money and relationships can be tricky. The author did ask for forgiveness of a debt that was previously agreed upon. Even though he says he wasn't expecting it, the way he framed it might have been too much for her. She might have felt that the debt was a personal matter and not something to be negotiated after her windfall. Also, the fact that she mentioned she's not like him could indicate different values regarding money.\n\nBut the author's actions\u2014being grateful, trying to pay back even with sacrifices\u2014show he's trying. The problem might be in how he approached the request. Maybe he should have discussed it more sensitively, considering her feelings about money. However, her reaction seems harsh. She laughed at him, dismissed his feelings, and made a derogatory comment. That's not a healthy response.\n\nOn the author's part, trying to rationalize with numbers after she was upset might have escalated things. But he wasn't trying to make her feel guilty; he was explaining his perspective. The key issue is mutual respect. The author might not be wrong for asking, especially since it's a small portion of her winnings, but he could have approached it differently. However, her response was definitely inappropriate and disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the main problem isn't the author asking but her reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
