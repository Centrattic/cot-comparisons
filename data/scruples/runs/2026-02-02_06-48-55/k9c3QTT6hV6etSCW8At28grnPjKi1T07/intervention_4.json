Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the guy borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend, who later won 100,000\u20ac in a raffle. The guy then asked her to forgive the debt, but she was upset and their relationship broke down. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy had a valid reason to ask for debt relief since she won a large sum. The debt was significant for him, and he was making sacrifices to repay it. The girlfriend, however, said no and responded harshly, which led to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The author says he wasn't expecting her to forgive the debt but thought it was a reasonable request given her windfall. The girlfriend might have felt that he was taking advantage of her good fortune. The question is whether the author's request was unreasonable.\n\nFinancial expectations in relationships can be tricky. Even if the request seems logical (3,000\u20ac is 3% of her winnings), it's a personal decision for the person who received the money. The author might not have considered her feelings about that money, especially if she values it highly or if there's a cultural context where such requests are taboo.\n\nAlso, the author tried to rationalize his request by comparing his sacrifices, which might come off as guilt-tripping. That could have escalated the conflict. The way he approached the conversation and the way she responded both could be at fault. But the core issue is whether the request itself was in the wrong.\n\nIf the debt was a loan agreed upon with terms, then the author might be expected to repay it regardless. But if there was an informal understanding, the situation is different. The girlfriend might have felt the loan was a gift, so expecting the debt to be forgiven could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author made a request that was reasonable from his perspective but might not consider the other person's stance. The girlfriend's harsh reaction is also problematic, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he had a legitimate reason to ask. However, his approach might have been flawed. The main issue is whether the request itself is wrong. Since the debt was a personal loan and the windfall is her money, the author isn't in the wrong for asking, but he should have considered her feelings more. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
