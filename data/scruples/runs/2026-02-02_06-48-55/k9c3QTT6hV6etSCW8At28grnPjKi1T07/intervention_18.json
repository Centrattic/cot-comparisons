Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author borrowed \u20ac3000 from their girlfriend when they were in a tough spot, and now she just won \u20ac100,000 in a raffle. The author asked her to forgive the debt, but she got upset and they had a big argument. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a financial bind when they needed the car and the repairs. The girlfriend lent them the money, which they've been trying to pay back by cutting their expenses a lot. Now, with the girlfriend's windfall, the author thought maybe the debt could be forgiven. But the way the girlfriend reacted was harsh.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The author says they didn't expect the debt to be forgiven, just that they asked. But the girlfriend felt disrespected. The author tried to rationalize by citing the percentages (3k vs 100k), which might have come off as calculating or making the request about numbers rather than emotions. Also, the author didn't communicate their financial struggles during the time they were paying her back, which might have led to misunderstandings.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was definitely not great\u2014laughing, being dismissive, and using a disrespectful comment. That's not healthy behavior in a relationship. But the author's approach in making the request might have been problematic. Asking for debt forgiveness, even if it's a small percentage, after the person has already offered to pay it back, could be seen as taking advantage, especially if it's framed as a logical calculation rather than a heartfelt request.\n\nHowever, the author was in a difficult situation when they needed the money, and the girlfriend helped them out. Now that she has the money, the author is trying to relieve some of the burden they've been under. The problem is how the request was made and the lack of communication about the sacrifices being made. The author might have assumed that the girlfriend would understand their perspective without explaining their side, leading to a clash.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they were in a tough spot and needed help, which the girlfriend provided. On the other hand, the way the request was made and the lack of empathy for the girlfriend's feelings about her money might have contributed to the conflict. The author's attempt to rationalize with numbers could have been hurtful, as emotions play a big role in relationships.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did make a request that was reasonable in amount but mishandled in its delivery. They might have assumed the girlfriend would be more understanding without considering her emotional reaction to the request. Therefore, the author could share some responsibility for how the situation escalated.\n"
