Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether it's reasonable to ask their girlfriend to forgive a 3,000\u20ac debt after she won 100,000\u20ac. \n\nFirst, the author took a loan from their girlfriend to fix their car, which I can see as a personal financial decision. They've been trying to pay her back, which shows responsibility. Now that she won a large sum, the author asks if she can forgive the debt. The reaction from the girlfriend was harsh, and the author is questioning if they were wrong to make the request.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author was in a tough spot financially and had the girlfriend help them out. Now, when she has extra money, he's asking if she can write off the debt. On the surface, it might seem like a reasonable request, especially since 3k is a small fraction of her windfall. However, the context is important. The debt was a personal loan, and unless there was an agreement that it could be forgiven under certain circumstances, the author is still obligated to repay it. \n\nThe author's approach might have come off as entitled. They mention they were \"only\" asking and not expecting, but the way they presented it might not have considered their girlfriend's perspective. She might see the debt as a personal loan that she's not obligated to forgive, especially if she's not in the habit of spending money. The line \"I'm just not somebody like you\" suggests that maybe she felt the author has a different attitude towards money, perhaps being more willing to spend or forgive debts than she is. \n\nThe author's attempt to rationalize their request with numbers might have been seen as confrontational. Bringing up the percentage of her winnings and comparing their financial sacrifices could have been perceived as trying to guilt-trip her. That could explain why she reacted so strongly. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. They were in a difficult situation and needed help, which is understandable. But when the opportunity to forgive the debt arose, the way they approached it might have been insensitive. They didn't consider that the loan was a personal matter and that her decision to keep the money is her choice. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was definitely harsh and disrespectful, but the author's request might have been a contributing factor. They might have crossed a line by trying to use the windfall to their advantage without considering her feelings or the nature of their agreement. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions might not have been malicious, the act of asking for the debt to be forgiven in that context and manner could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries of their financial agreement and the girlfriend's personal boundaries around money.\n"
