Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author (m20) borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend to fix his car. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like eating cheaply. Then his girlfriend wins 100,000\u20ac. He asks her if she can forgive his debt, but she gets angry and says things that hurt him. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to ask.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. When someone lends money, the expectation is usually repayment unless it's a gift. The author's SO gave him the money as a loan, not a gift, so he's trying to pay her back. But then when she has a windfall, he's asking if she can write it off. Is that reasonable?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's grateful but also struggling. He's been sacrificing a lot to repay her. From the SO's side, she might feel that the money was a loan, and she's entitled to get it back. Also, the author didn't mention his sacrifices before, which might have led to misunderstandings.\n\nThe key points: Was the initial loan a gift or a loan? The author said she \"generously lent\" it, implying a loan. So expecting repayment is normal. The author's request to have it forgiven after she won money might be seen as taking advantage, especially since he didn't communicate his struggles earlier. The SO's reaction might be harsh, but the author's approach in asking could be seen as crossing a line by implying she should give up the money.\n\nAlso, the author tried to justify his request by comparing his contributions versus hers, which might have made her feel attacked. The phrase \"I'm just not somebody like you\" could hint at differing values, maybe implying she's more practical or values money more. \n\nSo, did the author do something wrong? He might have in expecting the loan to be forgiven without prior discussion. Loans are typically expected to be repaid unless agreed otherwise. By waiting until she had the money to ask, he might have overstepped. The way he brought up the comparison of their spending could have been hurtful. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
