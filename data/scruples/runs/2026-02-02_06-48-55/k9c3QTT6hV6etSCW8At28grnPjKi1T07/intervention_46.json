Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy (the author) who asked his girlfriend to forgive his debt after she won a large sum of money. The key points to consider are the context of their financial arrangements, the way the author approached the request, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author had financial difficulties. He borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend to fix his car, which was necessary because his parents couldn't help. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like eating cheap food. That shows he's made efforts to repay the debt, which is commendable.\n\nThen, the girlfriend won 100,000\u20ac. The author asked her to forgive the debt, but she reacted poorly, laughing and calling him out for expecting it. She mentioned that 3,000\u20ac is a lot to her and said she's not like him, implying he might be willing to give up more. The author felt disrespected and tried to explain his situation, leading to an argument where she called him an a**hole and ended the conversation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Did he have a legitimate reason to ask? He had already repaid some of the debt and was cutting back significantly. Given that she won 100,000\u20ac, asking for 3,000\u20ac as a one-time expense could be seen as reasonable, especially since it's a small percentage of her winnings. However, the way he approached it might matter. He says he didn't expect it but still asked. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh, but she might have felt that the debt was a personal commitment he made to repay, regardless of her situation.\n\nBut the bigger issue is the communication breakdown. The author didn't mention his struggles to her before, which might have caused her to not understand his perspective. When he finally brings it up, he tries to rationalize it with numbers, which could come off as calculating. She might feel that he's using her money to solve his problem, even though he's tried to repay her otherwise.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's been sacrificing a lot, but if he didn't communicate that earlier, she might not have been aware. Also, the way he explained his situation after her rejection might have seemed like an accusation, making her defensive. She could perceive it as him implying that he does more for the relationship, which might not be the case.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's possible that both parties have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's asking for forgiveness of a debt he had already started repaying and under circumstances where the other person had a windfall, his request isn't inherently wrong. However, the approach might have been flawed. But given the context, the author's actions could be justified. The girlfriend's reaction was certainly harsh, but the question is about the author's responsibility. If he asked respectfully without expecting it, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he made her feel guilty or used the situation to pressure her, that's where the issue lies. The answer depends on whether the request was framed properly. Since he didn't expect it and was grateful, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
