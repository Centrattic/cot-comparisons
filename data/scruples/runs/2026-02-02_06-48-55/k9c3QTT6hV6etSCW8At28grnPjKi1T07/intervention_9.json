Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author (m20) and their girlfriend (19) who won 100,000\u20ac and the author asked for the 3,000\u20ac debt to be forgiven. The girlfriend was upset, and now they're arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author took on debt to get a car and driver's license because the girlfriend wanted to meet more easily. The girlfriend lent him the money when his car broke down. He's been trying to pay her back, even sacrificing his own expenses. Then she wins a large sum and he asks for the debt relief. She reacts negatively, and he feels disrespected.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's the case. Let's analyze both sides. \n\nThe author's actions: He asked for the debt to be forgiven after she won money. He acknowledges he didn't expect her to say yes but still made the request. He tried to explain his reasoning, which led to her anger. He might have overstepped by bringing up the sacrifices he made, making it seem like he's comparing their contributions. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She agreed to lend the money initially, which was a kind gesture. Winning 100k is a windfall, but she might feel that forgiving a 3k debt is a significant portion of her earnings, even though it's 3%. She might also feel that the author is taking advantage of her good fortune, especially since he didn't mention his struggles before. Her reaction, while harsh, could stem from feeling pressured or unappreciated.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did ask for a favor after a significant financial gain. Even though the debt was a loan, when a partner wins a large sum, there's an expectation of discretion. The author might have assumed that because she won money, she could easily forgive the debt. However, that's not necessarily the case. Money can be a sensitive topic, and expecting someone to give up even a small percentage of a windfall might be too much, even if it's a small amount for them. \n\nAdditionally, when he tried to rationalize his request by comparing their sacrifices, it might have come across as accusatory. That could have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of feeling that her generosity is being taken for granted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a tough spot financially, and the initial loan was a gesture of support. Forgiving a small part of a windfall might seem reasonable to him, but it's not the girlfriend's obligation. The key here is communication. The author didn't discuss his financial struggles before making the request, which might have led to misunderstandings. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not being more aware of the girlfriend's boundaries and for approaching the request in a way that felt like pressure. However, the girlfriend's harsh response also contributed to the conflict. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nI think the author's mistake was in the approach. Asking for debt forgiveness after a windfall is a sensitive topic, and he didn't handle it carefully. He should have approached it with more empathy and understanding, rather than justifying his position with numbers. The debt was a loan, and unless there was an agreement to forgive it, it's not something the girlfriend is obligated to do. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but it's a nuanced situation. However, based on standard AITA analysis, the person who made the request without considering the other's feelings is often the one in the wrong, so A.\n"
