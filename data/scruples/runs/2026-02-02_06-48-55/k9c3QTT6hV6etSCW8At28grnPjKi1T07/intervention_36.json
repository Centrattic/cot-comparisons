Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nSo, the author took a loan of 3,000\u20ac from their girlfriend to fix their car. They've been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like buying cheap food. Then, when the girlfriend wins 100,000\u20ac, the author asks if she can forgive the debt. The girlfriend reacts negatively, saying things that hurt the author, and the conversation escalates into an argument where the girlfriend calls them an a**hole and says to f*** off. Now they're wondering if they were wrong to ask.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They were in a tough spot financially, borrowed money from their girlfriend, and worked hard to repay her. When given a chance (through her winning money) to have the debt forgiven, they thought it was a reasonable request, especially since it's a small percentage (3%) of her winnings. They felt disrespected by her reaction and tried to explain their position, which led to the argument.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She lent the money out of generosity. When the author asked to have the debt forgiven, she felt it was a betrayal. Her reaction was harsh, but maybe she felt the debt was a personal matter and not something to be forgiven just because she won money. She might feel that the author is treating her generosity as something expected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider factors like communication, expectations, and respect. The author asked, but maybe they should have considered that the money was a gift that was meant to be repaid. The girlfriend might have seen the loan as a conditional gift, so expecting it to be forgiven could be seen as taking advantage. However, the way she reacted was definitely hurtful and disrespectful, regardless of their stance.\n\nThe author's attempt to rationalize their request by comparing their sacrifices to the 3% might have come off as trying to guilt-trip her, which could have exacerbated the situation. They might not have been wrong in asking, but their approach could have been better. Alternatively, maybe they had the right to ask, given the context of their financial struggles.\n\nBut the key here is that when the author asked, they should have respected her decision if she said no, without making it about love or sacrifices. The girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author's framing of the request might have triggered her defensiveness.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? They might have been wrong in how they approached the request, especially when it came to rationalizing it by comparing their efforts. However, the request itself could be seen as understandable given the circumstances. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong. However, the way they tried to justify it after the initial request might have been problematic. Alternatively, maybe the author was not in the wrong for asking, but their subsequent actions after the argument (trying to explain their side) might have been necessary but handled poorly.\n\nI think the main issue is that the author didn't consider that the girlfriend might have felt the debt was a personal matter and that asking to have it forgiven, even with good intentions, could be seen as disrespectful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision to not forgive the debt, especially if they had agreed on repayment terms initially. Alternatively, if the loan was informal and the author felt it was a form of support, maybe it's a mutual understanding. But since the author was actively repaying her, perhaps they shouldn't have expected forgiveness when she didn't want to. Hmm. It's a tough call. The girlfriend's reaction was definitely harsh, but the author's request might have been crossing a line, depending on the nature of the loan. If it was a formal agreement, forgiving it without consultation might be okay, but if it was an informal one, maybe the author should have just kept paying as agreed. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for asking, as it could be seen as breaking the implicit agreement. Therefore, answer A.\n"
