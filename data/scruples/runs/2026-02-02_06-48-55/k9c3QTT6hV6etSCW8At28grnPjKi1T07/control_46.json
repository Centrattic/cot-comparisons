Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is the author, who's in a relationship, borrowed 3,000\u20ac from their girlfriend, who recently won 100,000\u20ac. The author asked her to forgive the debt, which is 3% of her winnings. The girlfriend reacted negatively, calling the author an a***ole and telling them to f*** off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author took a loan from the girlfriend, which they've been trying to repay through sacrifices. The girlfriend has a strict attitude towards spending money. Now, when the author asks for debt relief after the girlfriend's windfall, the response was harsh. The key points here are the nature of the loan, the communication between the partners, and the emotional response.\n\nThe author's request: asking to forgive the debt after the girlfriend's significant gain. Is that reasonable? Well, 3,000\u20ac is a small fraction (3%) of 100k. But the girlfriend might see the loan as a personal matter, not a business transaction. The author might have felt entitled to forgiveness due to the financial sacrifice, but the girlfriend might feel that debts are debts, regardless of new funds.\n\nCommunication issues: The author didn't explain their struggles before making the request. The girlfriend might have felt blindsided, leading to her defensive reaction. The author's attempt to justify their request by comparing percentages could come off as accusatory, which the girlfriend perceived as the author trying to make her feel guilty.\n\nEmotional response: The girlfriend's reaction was harsh. However, the author's approach might have been confrontational, leading to the argument. The girlfriend's comment about the author being \"not someone like me\" is a red flag, indicating a devaluing of the author's character. That's a problem, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nThe author's actions: They asked for forgiveness without prior discussion, then tried to rationalize with numbers during the argument. That could be seen as using logic to guilt-trip, which isn't healthy. However, the girlfriend's response was disproportionate and disrespectful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be, considering the loan context and the girlfriend's harsh reaction. However, their approach could have been better handled. They should have discussed their struggles with the girlfriend before making the request, rather than confronting her during the conversation. The girlfriend's reaction was unkind, but the author's method might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both have some fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's response was clearly wrong, but the author's approach could be seen as contributing. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because the request was reasonable and the girlfriend's reaction was the main issue.\n"
