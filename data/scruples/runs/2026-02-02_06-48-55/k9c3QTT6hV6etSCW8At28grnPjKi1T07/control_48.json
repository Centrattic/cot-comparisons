Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (a 20-year-old man) who borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend (19 years old) to fix his car. Now, she won 100,000\u20ac in a raffle and he asked her, without expecting, if she could forgive the debt. She reacted negatively, which led to an argument and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author took a loan from his girlfriend to fix his car after using his savings. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs. Now, she has a large sum and he's asking her to relieve him of the debt, not expecting it but still asking. Her reaction was dismissive, even disrespectful. He tried to explain his reasoning, which led to her anger.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the question is whether he's at fault. The debt was a personal loan between partners. Normally, when someone gives money to a partner, especially in a relationship, there might be an understanding that it's a loan with certain expectations. But the author explicitly mentions that he's been paying her back, so he's fulfilling his part. \n\nNow, when she won money, he asked if she could forgive the debt. The amount is 3,000\u20ac, which is 3% of her winnings. Some might argue that it's reasonable for him to ask, especially since he's been struggling to pay her back. However, others might say that expecting her to forgive a loan, even after a windfall, could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the loan wasn't a gift but an agreement.\n\nBut the way she reacted\u2014laughing, calling him an *asshole*, etc.\u2014seems harsh. The author feels disrespected. On the other hand, she might feel that the debt isn't something she's obligated to forgive, especially since she had her own reasons for lending the money. She might have expected repayment, which he was doing. The fact that he's been sacrificing a lot to pay her back might make her feel it's not appropriate to ask for forgiveness now.\n\nHowever, the author's attempt to rationalize his request by comparing his sacrifices to her windfall could come off as manipulative or putting pressure on her. He might have made her feel guilty for not forgiving the debt, which could be why she reacted so negatively. The line between expressing gratitude for the loan and pressuring for forgiveness is thin here.\n\nThe key factors to consider are: Was there an explicit agreement when the loan was given? If it was a loan with the expectation of repayment, then the author is still within his rights to ask for repayment. However, if it was more of a gift, then the situation changes. The author mentions that she \"generously lent it to me,\" which implies it was a loan. So he has a right to expect repayment. But the size of the windfall (100k) versus the 3k debt is a big difference. \n\nBut the way he framed his request might have been insensitive. Approaching her with a calculation of percentages could make her feel it's a transactional relationship. Her response was certainly unkind, but his approach might have contributed to the conflict. He might have been in the wrong by not respecting her boundaries or by making her feel guilty for not forgiving the loan, even though she had a right to expect repayment.\n\nOn the other hand, she might be in the wrong for her harsh reaction. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he wasn't wrong to ask, but his approach was flawed, then maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, if the act of asking itself is wrong regardless of approach, then A.\n\nI think the main issue is that the author might have misjudged the sensitivity of the situation. He had the right to ask, but the way he explained his reasoning, especially in a confrontational manner after she refused, could have been inappropriate. But the initial request wasn't necessarily wrong. So, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the request itself was reasonable, but the handling of the conversation might have been poor. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not about the handling. The initial act of asking, even if poorly executed, isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
