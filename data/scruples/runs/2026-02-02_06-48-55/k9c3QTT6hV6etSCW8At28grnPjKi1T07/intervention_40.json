Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend asking his girlfriend to forgive his debt after she won a large sum of money. The author is asking if he was in the wrong for making that request.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend borrowed \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend when he needed help with a car and getting his driver's license. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, even to the point of being very frugal. Now, after winning \u20ac100,000, he asked her to forgive the debt, which she refused, and the conversation escalated into an argument.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship and the expectations around money. The girlfriend had already given the money as a loan, and he's been repaying it. When she wins money, he's asking if she can forgive the debt. From his perspective, it's a small portion (3%) of her winnings. However, she might see the loan as a separate matter from the raffle winnings, especially if she didn't expect to have that money. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. The initial loan was a generous act from the girlfriend. She helped when he needed it, expecting repayment.\n2. The boyfriend has been repaying the debt, showing responsibility.\n3. The request after her winning the money is a new situation. She might feel that forgiving the debt would be unfair or that the money is meant for her own plans.\n4. The way the girlfriend reacted (laughing, calling him an asshole) is unkind, but the author is also asking if he was wrong in his approach.\n\nThe author's mistake might be in how he framed the request. Instead of being grateful for her initial help and continuing his repayment, he might have come across as entitled once she had the means to forgive the debt. He used logical arguments and compared his sacrifices to her actions, which could have made her feel attacked. The girlfriend felt disrespected and defensive, leading to the argument.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"I'm just not someone like you\" suggests a mismatch in their values regarding money. The author might have expected her to prioritize his needs, but she may value keeping her own money regardless of their relationship. The author's attempt to rationalize his request by comparing percentages might not consider her perspective, making the situation more contentious.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not in the wrong for needing help and repaying the loan. However, his approach to forgiving the debt after her win might have been poorly timed or presented without considering her feelings. He could have approached the conversation with more empathy, understanding that she might have her own plans for the money, rather than making it about proving his sacrifice. The way he defended himself by listing his efforts could have made her feel criticized, escalating the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely at fault for making the request, his method of handling the conversation and the way he framed his arguments might have contributed to the breakdown in communication. Therefore, there's a shared responsibility here, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, I need to see if that's justified.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he was trying to resolve a debt and had a valid request, but his approach could have been better. However, the initial question is whether he is in the wrong, and given the way the request was made and the response it elicited, there's a case to say he did have some fault in how he communicated his needs. But the main issue is the girlfriend's reaction, so maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. Hmm.\n"
