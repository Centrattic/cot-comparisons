Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a debt from the author to their girlfriend, who won a large sum of money. The key points to consider are the context of the debt, the nature of the request, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author took on the debt because they needed a car and a driver's license, which their girlfriend encouraged. The girlfriend lent the 3,000\u20ac, and the author has been making efforts to pay her back, even making significant sacrifices. When the girlfriend won 100,000\u20ac, the author asked if she could forgive the debt, which is 3% of her winnings. The girlfriend reacted harshly, laughing, saying money is her line, and calling the author an a**hole.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to ask. The author didn't expect a forgiveness but was making a request. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. The author was trying to explain their sacrifices and felt disrespected. The girlfriend's response was dismissive and hurtful. The author's request was reasonable given the context, especially since they were already repaying the debt through sacrifices. The girlfriend's insistence on keeping the debt despite her newfound wealth and the author's efforts could be seen as unfair.\n\nHowever, the author did approach the girlfriend directly about forgiving the debt, which might be seen as a valid request. The way the author tried to rationalize it by comparing their sacrifices might have come across as accusatory, leading to the girlfriend's anger. The key here is whether the request itself was inconsiderate or if the manner of making it was the issue.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's reaction, it's clear she's uncomfortable with the idea of forgiving the debt, which is her right. The harshness of her response, though, is problematic. The author's request, while perhaps not perfectly worded, was about a significant debt in the context of their relationship. The author was in a vulnerable position, needing the car for the relationship, and the debt was to enable that. The forgiveness request, while a lot, was a small percentage of her winnings and might be seen as a way to move forward without the burden.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making the request, especially given the circumstances. The girlfriend's reaction was inappropriate, but the request itself was reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
