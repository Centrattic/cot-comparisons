Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their partner to forgive a 3,000\u20ac debt after the partner won 100,000\u20ac. \n\nFirst, the context: The author borrowed the money from their girlfriend when they were in a tough spot, and they've been repaying it by cutting costs. Now, after the girlfriend wins a large sum, the author asks if she can forgive the debt. The girlfriend reacts strongly, even getting angry and cutting off communication.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were wrong to ask. Let me consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to be in debt, borrowed from their partner, and was trying to repay it. When given a chance to have it forgiven, they asked. But the way the girlfriend reacted suggests that this request was a dealbreaker for her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, asking to have a debt forgiven when the lender suddenly has the means to do so isn't inherently wrong. The debt was a personal loan between partners, and the author had a history of making sacrifices to repay it. However, the key here is the context of their relationship. The author mentions that they've been spending their last euros on small things for the girlfriend, which might have built up resentment. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense. She laughed, said the author was joking, called them an asshole, and said to \"f*** off.\" That's harsh. But perhaps the author's approach was too direct or made the girlfriend feel pressured. The line \"I'm just not someone like you\" implies that the author is more generous, which could be a point of contention. \n\nThe author tried to rationalize their request by pointing out percentages, which might have come across as calculating and hurtful. The girlfriend might have felt that the author was keeping score or not valuing her contributions otherwise. \n\nIn relationships, money is a sensitive topic. The author's request might have been framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel attacked or undervalued. Even if the financial aspect isn't the issue, the emotional response suggests deeper issues. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They had a legitimate request, but the way they approached it\u2014especially bringing up the percentages and their sacrifices\u2014might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but it's also possible that the author's actions made her feel disrespected. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's request isn't inherently wrong, but the manner in which they followed up after the initial rejection could have been more considerate. The girlfriend's reaction is also inappropriate, but the author might have crossed a line by pushing the rationalization, making it a matter of being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but their approach had flaws. However, the girlfriend's response was also extreme. But the question is about the author's actions. Since the author had a reason to ask and the debt was a loan between them, they aren't in the wrong. The main issue is how the situation was handled emotionally, not the request itself.\n"
