Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend won 100k euros, and the boyfriend is asking her to forgive his 3k debt. They're both 19 and 20, so pretty young.\n\nFirst, the context: the boyfriend needed a car and driver's license to make their meetings easier. He spent his savings, then when the car broke, she lent him 3k. He's been paying her back, even cutting costs a lot. Now she wins 100k, and he asks her to forgive the debt, which she takes as a joke and gets upset. She calls him an asshole and they broke up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. \n\nOn the author's side: he was in a tough spot, had no family support, she helped him out. He's been trying to pay her back, even to the point of sacrificing a lot. When she wins a lot of money, he sees an opportunity to clear the debt quickly. His request isn't a demand, he's just asking. He thought he was showing his commitment by paying back, and when she dismissed it harshly, he was hurt and tried to explain his reasoning. \n\nOn her side: she gave a loan expecting repayment. Even though she won a large sum, she might feel it's her money to decide how to use. She calls him a \"somebody like me,\" which is harsh, but maybe it's about differing values. She might not want to use her money to pay for his previous debt, which he caused through his own choices (buying a car he couldn't afford, etc.). Her reaction was emotional and disrespectful, but perhaps she felt he was taking advantage of her win. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he asked, which isn't inherently wrong. But the problem is the dynamics of their relationship. He's been paying her back through sacrifices, but didn't communicate his efforts before. When he brought up the debt after her win, he might have made her feel her generosity was a transaction. Also, by pointing out the percentage (3% vs. his monthly sacrifices), he might have implied she's not as generous as he is, which could be seen as guilt-tripping. \n\nHer response was definitely harsh, but his approach could be seen as expecting her to forgive a debt she never agreed to in the first place. The debt was a personal loan, and unless there was a prior agreement about using her windfall, he's asking her to change the terms. That could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, while her reaction was extreme, the author might have overstepped by not considering that the debt was a personal matter. Even if he was sacrificing, the debt was a loan, and she might not want to use her own money to cover it. His attempt to rationalize with percentages might have come across as calculating, which could have hurt her feelings. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he made a request based on an informal loan and then used guilt when she refused, which could damage trust. The initial loan was a personal agreement, and expecting her to use her winnings to cancel it might not be fair. His communication approach could have been better, leading to the conflict.\n"
