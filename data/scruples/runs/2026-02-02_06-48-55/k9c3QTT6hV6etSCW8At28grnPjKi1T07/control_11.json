Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old guy who asked his girlfriend to forgive his debt after she won 100,000\u20ac. He had taken a loan of 3,000\u20ac from her earlier when he had car troubles, and he's been working hard to pay it back. He mentions that he's been cutting costs a lot, like buying cheap food, just to save up. The girlfriend, who's also 19, didn't want to spend money on small things, so he spent his own money on her stuff even when he was struggling. Then, when she won the money, he asked her to forgive the debt. She laughed at him, said she loves him but drew the line at money, and called him not like her. The author felt disrespected and tried to explain his side, which led to her getting angry and cutting contact.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her to forgive the debt. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the debt was a loan. When someone lends money, there's an expectation that it will be repaid. The author borrowed 3,000\u20ac and has been working to pay it back. However, when the girlfriend won 100,000\u20ac, the author asked her to forgive the debt. The key here is that even though she has the money now, the original agreement was a loan. Unless she specifically said it was a gift, the author is obligated to repay it. But the author is wondering if it's reasonable to ask for forgiveness because the amount is 3% of her winnings.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The author felt that he's been making sacrifices for her, and when he asked, she reacted harshly. The girlfriend might feel that the debt was a loan and not a gift, so expecting forgiveness is unreasonable. The author's approach might have come off as presumptuous. However, he did say he wasn't expecting it but just asked. But the way the girlfriend responded was disrespectful, which is a problem.\n\nAnother angle is their relationship dynamics. The author has been making personal sacrifices to pay her back while also spending money on her small pleasures even when he was struggling. This shows he values the relationship a lot. But when he asked for forgiveness, he might have felt it's a way to acknowledge his sacrifices. However, the girlfriend might see that as trying to guilt-trip her or not respecting the terms of the loan.\n\nThe author's message is in the wrong if he shouldn't have asked for forgiveness of a loan. But if the debt was a loan, then it's not in the wrong. However, the way he approached it might have been an issue. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe the author should have considered the terms of the loan before asking. Alternatively, the girlfriend's response was inappropriate, and the author's request wasn't unreasonable given the context of their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, financial matters can be tricky. If the loan was a loan, then it's a financial obligation. However, when a partner wins a large sum, it's understandable that the borrower might feel asking for forgiveness is reasonable, especially if they've been working hard to repay. But the girlfriend might feel that the loan was a separate agreement, and she has a right to decide how to use her winnings without being pressured.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he asked for forgiveness without any prior agreement, maybe. But the amount is a small percentage of her winnings. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's request wasn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he presented it might have triggered her because she might not feel comfortable with the idea of forgiving the debt, especially if it was a loan. The author could have approached it more sensitively, but the core request might not be in the wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the loan was a gift, then there's no obligation. But since it was a loan, she's entitled to the money. So the author might be in the wrong for expecting forgiveness. However, considering the context of their relationship and his sacrifices, the question is whether the request was reasonable. The answer might depend on whether the loan was a gift or a loan. If it was a loan, then he's in the right to expect repayment. If it was a gift, then she's not obligated. The original post says \"my GF generously lent it to me,\" which suggests it's a loan. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for asking for forgiveness without the girlfriend's prior agreement. However, the girlfriend's response was disrespectful, which complicates things. But in terms of the original question, is the author in the wrong? The answer is likely A (Yes) because he's asking for forgiveness of a loan, which the girlfriend isn't obligated to do. Even if the amount is small relative to her winnings, the terms of the loan are separate from that. So the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate of the original agreement.\n"
