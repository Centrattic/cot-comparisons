Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a guy who borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend (SO) when he needed it for a car repair. Now, after she won 100,000\u20ac, he asked her (without expecting) if she could forgive the debt. She reacted negatively, saying he's \"not someone like her,\" and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author borrowed money when he was in a tough spot, and he's been trying to pay it back through sacrifices. His request, even though he says he's not expecting a yes, is to have the debt forgiven because his girlfriend suddenly has a lot of money. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, money can be a sensitive topic. The girlfriend lent him the money initially, which was a significant amount for him. Now, he's asking her to write off that debt, which is 3% of her winnings. But the way he framed his request might have come across as entitled or taking her generosity for granted. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to ask for forgiveness of the debt? Was his approach appropriate? The girlfriend might feel that by lending him the money, he had a responsibility to pay it back, and her winning the money is her own financial gain, not something she's obligated to use for him. The author's mention of his sacrifices might have been an attempt to justify his request, but in doing so, he might have made her feel guilty or implied she wasn't contributing enough to the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be because she felt the request was unfair. The phrase \"I'm just not someone like you\" could indicate that she sees him as taking advantage of her generosity. The author's approach to rationalizing his request with numbers might have been too logical and not considerate of her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, expectations around money can vary. If the debt was a loan, then it's a financial obligation. However, if it was a gift, the expectation might be different. The original agreement (loan vs. gift) isn't clear here. The author might be in the wrong if the money was a loan and he's now asking her to forgive it without prior arrangement. \n\nAlso, the way he brought up his sacrifices after she said no could be seen as guilt-tripping, which isn't healthy. It's possible he overstepped by trying to justify his request with percentages and comparing his contributions, which might have made her feel undervalued or attacked. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for a few reasons: not respecting the initial terms of the loan, approaching the request in a way that could be seen as entitled or manipulative, and not considering his partner's feelings when discussing the matter. The girlfriend's anger might be a valid reaction to feeling disrespected.\n"
