Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a 20-year-old guy who borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend (19 years old) to fix his car. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting his expenses. Then, when she wins 100,000\u20ac, he asks her if she could forgive the debt. She reacts negatively, laughing, saying she's not like him, and they end up in a fight.\n\nSo the key points here: Did the author do something wrong by asking to have the debt forgiven? The girlfriend had given him the money initially as a loan, and he's been working to pay her back. The question is whether it was reasonable for him to ask for forgiveness after she came into unexpected money.\n\nLegally, if it was a loan, the author is obligated to repay it unless the terms are renegotiated. But this is more about the relationship. The author didn't expect her to forgive it but felt it was a reasonable request given her sudden financial windfall. The girlfriend felt disrespected by the request, especially when he tried to rationalize it by comparing their spending habits.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as trying to frame his financial sacrifices as a justification for her to forgive the debt, which could come across as manipulative. However, he didn't demand it, just asked. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, which might indicate her own issues with the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, entering into a loan with a partner can be tricky. If the loan was informal, there's ambiguity. The author's request might not be wrong, but his approach could have been better. However, his main action was asking, not demanding. The girlfriend was upset about the way it was framed, possibly making the author's defense come off as guilt-tripping. But he didn't expect her to say yes. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has the right to say no, and the author might have overstepped in trying to justify his request by comparing their financial contributions. But since he's still trying to pay it back, maybe he's not in the wrong. The relationship dynamics and communication issues are more at play here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he made a request without expecting it, and the girlfriend's reaction was more extreme. However, his justification could have been better phrased. The line between being reasonable and manipulative is thin here.\n"
