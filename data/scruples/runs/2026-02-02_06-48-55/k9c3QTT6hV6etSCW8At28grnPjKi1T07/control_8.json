Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (let's call him A) borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend (GF) when he was in a tough spot. He had to get a car and a driver's license, which he couldn't afford on his own. His GF helped him out, and he's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs. Now, the GF won 100,000\u20ac, and A asked if she could forgive his debt or part of it. She reacted negatively, saying he was joking, drew a line at money, and that he's someone who would do that for her, but she isn't like him. They had a big argument, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if A's request was reasonable. The debt was 3,000\u20ac, which is 3% of the 100k the GF won. So, in terms of numbers, it's a small part of what she got. But maybe the context matters. When she lent him the money initially, was there an agreement that it would be forgiven under certain circumstances? The story doesn't mention that. If she lent it to him as a loan, he's supposed to repay it. So asking to have it forgiven after she won a large sum could be seen as an unexpected request unless there's an existing understanding.\n\nBut then, the GF's reaction is harsh. She laughed, called him an a**hole, and told him to f*** off. That's a significant emotional reaction. The author didn't expect her to say yes, but felt disrespected by her tone. The key point here is communication. Did the author explain his reasoning before making the request? He says he didn't talk about the sacrifices he's been making to repay her. So he went in with the request, and she might have felt blindsided. \n\nAlso, the GF's personality is mentioned as someone who hates spending money. Maybe she's really sensitive about money and feels that forgiving the debt would be giving up something she values, even if it's a small percentage. However, the author's argument is that he's been making significant sacrifices to repay her, and she didn't know about those. So, maybe he should have communicated his struggles before making the request, instead of just bringing it up suddenly after her windfall.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's been sacrificing a lot to pay her back, and he felt his request was reasonable given the 3% of her winnings. But he didn't mention his sacrifices until after she refused, which might have made her feel he was trying to guilt-trip her. The GF's reaction might stem from feeling that the request came out of the blue, without prior discussion, and the author tried to justify it after the fact, which could have escalated the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the loan was meant to be repaid, then asking to have it forgiven is a request, but the way he approached it might have been problematic. By not discussing his situation and sacrifices beforehand, he might have made her feel that he was taking advantage of her generosity after the fact. However, the GF's response was also extremely harsh and dismissive, which is not healthy in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for making the request, especially since it's a small portion of her windfall. However, the approach could have been better. The GF's reaction is also unkind, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The main issue is communication. The author didn't explain his reasoning before asking, which led to misunderstanding. So, maybe the author shared some responsibility for how he approached the conversation, but not entirely. The GF's response was definitely over the top and disrespectful, which suggests she's in the wrong in terms of how she handled it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). His request was reasonable given the context, and the GF's reaction was inappropriate. The author's approach could have been better by discussing the matter more thoughtfully and not surprising her with the request, but that doesn't make him entirely at fault. The GF's harsh response is more indicative of her being in the wrong here. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
