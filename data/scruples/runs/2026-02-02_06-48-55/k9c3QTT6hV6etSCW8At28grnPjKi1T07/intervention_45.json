Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a guy who borrowed \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend, who then won \u20ac100,000. He asked her to forgive the debt, but she reacted negatively, calling him an asshole and cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author took on debt to get a car and a driver's license because his girlfriend wanted to visit him more easily. She lent him the money when his car broke down. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, which shows he's been making sacrifices. When she won a large sum, he asked her to forgive the debt. Her reaction was harsh, which upset him.\n\nNow, the key points: Did he ask for something unreasonable? He didn't expect her to do it, but he asked. The debt was \u20ac3k out of \u20ac100k, which is 3%. He was trying to explain his sacrifices to her. She felt disrespected by his request, even though he didn't mean to make her feel guilty. She called him an asshole, which is a strong reaction.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Was the request unreasonable? Well, she lent him the money, so technically, he's supposed to pay her back. By asking for forgiveness, he's changing the terms of the agreement. But given that her windfall made this possible, maybe it's a reasonable request. However, she didn't have to agree, and he did ask. The way he rationalized his request by mentioning his sacrifices might have come off as guilt-tripping, which can push someone's buttons.\n\nOn the other hand, her reaction was disproportionate. Telling someone to f*** off after they made a request is harsh, especially if the request was phrased in a respectful manner. The author's main issue is her tone and the personal attack, not necessarily the request itself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's request was inconsiderate. He didn't force her to do anything; he just asked. He also framed it as a request, not an expectation. His explanation about his sacrifices might have been his way of showing why he was in a tough spot, but maybe it's not fair to compare his sacrifices to hers. However, the core of the problem seems to be her reaction, not his request. So, was he in the wrong? Possibly, in that he might have approached the conversation differently. But was the request itself wrong? Maybe not. It's a complex situation where both parties might have overreacted, but the user is asking specifically if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the request was unreasonable. Since it's 3% of her winnings, and he was paying her back through sacrifices, it's a small amount. He had a right to ask, even if she felt it was unfair. However, the way he tried to justify his request by comparing his sacrifices might have been a mistake. But overall, I think the author isn't in the wrong for making the request. His actions were a request, not a demand, and the response from his girlfriend was the more problematic part. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
