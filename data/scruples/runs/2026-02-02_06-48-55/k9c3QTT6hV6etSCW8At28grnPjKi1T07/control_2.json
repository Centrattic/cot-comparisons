Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic partner (SO) who won 100k euros and the author asking to have their debt of 3k euros forgiven. The SO responded negatively, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author borrowed 3k euros from their girlfriend, who is now in a position to forgive the debt. The author is trying to justify their request by pointing out the effort they've made to repay, even going to extremes like cutting expenses. They felt disrespected by the SO's reaction, which included laughter and a harsh response.\n\nThe SO's reaction seems to be about boundaries. She might have given the money as a loan expecting repayment, not a gift. The author didn't clarify this initially. The phrase \"I'm just not somebody like you\" suggests a difference in approach to money. The author is now using that debt as leverage when the SO has the means to forgive it, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nThe author's argument is that they've been making sacrifices, but the SO might feel that the debt was a personal decision that she isn't obligated to forgive now. The author's approach to rationalizing their request by comparing percentages (3k is 3% of 100k) might come off as transactional, implying that love should be quantified, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe key points are: the initial loan terms weren't discussed, the author didn't communicate their financial struggles earlier, and the request after the win might have been unexpected or felt like an ultimatum. The SO's right to set boundaries on money is important here. The author's frustration is valid, but their method of addressing the debt might have crossed a line by making it about the SO's character or not respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was possibly not discussing the loan terms upfront and using the debt as a bargaining chip after the fact. The SO had the right to say no without it being disrespectful. The author's reaction to the refusal, especially the argument about percentages, might have been too much, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the initial agreement and approached the situation in a way that could be seen as pressuring their partner.\n"
