Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple A or B answer, but I need to work through the reasoning first.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author (m20) borrowed \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend (19) when he was in a tough spot. He had to buy a car and get a driver's license because public transport wasn't feasible for their meetings. The girlfriend helped him out, and he's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like buying cheap dinners. Now, after she wins \u20ac100,000, he asks her if she can forgive his debt, even though he says he's not expecting it. Her reaction is harsh\u2014laughing, saying she won't do it, and calling him an a**hole when he defends his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong to ask. Was his request reasonable? He framed it as a question, not an expectation. The debt is \u20ac3,000, which is 3% of her winnings. He had a history of spending his own money to make her happy, like buying ice cream when he's broke. He felt disrespected by her response and tried to explain his sacrifices, but that led to a breakup.\n\nNow, from a financial standpoint, asking for forgiveness of a debt after someone wins a large amount might be seen as a logical request, especially if the lender can now afford to give it up. However, debts are typically expected to be repaid unless there's an agreement otherwise. The author had an agreement where he borrowed the money, and she lent it to him. So, if she didn't agree to forgive it when he asked, is that her right? \n\nBut the way he asked\u2014maybe not as a demand but a request\u2014could be seen as reasonable. However, the girlfriend's response was hurtful. His defense by explaining his sacrifices might have come off as trying to guilt-trip her, which could be seen as crossing a line. The line here is between expressing your feelings and making the other person feel guilty.\n\nThe key issue might be the dynamic of their relationship. If the author was already paying her back through his own efforts, but she was the one who initiated the lending, the debt is a separate issue. The author's request to forgive the debt after her windfall isn't necessarily wrong. But when he brings up the percentage and his own sacrifices, he might be overstepping, making it about comparison.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? He asked a question, which is not inherently wrong. However, the way he justified his request by comparing the percentages and mentioning his sacrifices might have been inappropriate. People might see the initial request as reasonable, but the subsequent argument could have been his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was harsh, and the author's defense was in response to her harshness. The question is whether his actions warranted the breakup. If the author's main wrongdoing was asking for forgiveness, which is a common practice in relationships (like forgiving debts when possible), then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the way he approached it crossed a line, then perhaps he is.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's request might be seen as reasonable, but his defense could have been the issue. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for asking, the answer might be B (No), because the request itself wasn't wrong. The problem may lie in how he handled the argument, not the initial question.\n"
