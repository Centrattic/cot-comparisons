Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (m20) borrowed 3000\u20ac from his girlfriend after his car broke down. He's been paying her back slowly, even cutting costs a lot. Then the girlfriend wins 100,000\u20ac and the author asks if she can forgive the debt, or at least part of it. She reacts harshly, laughing, saying she drew a line at money, and that he's not like her. The author gets upset, tries to explain his side, and she gets angry, calls him an asshole, and they haven't spoken since.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the debt, the context of the request, and the communication between the two. The author took on a loan from his girlfriend, which they had agreed upon. Now that she's come into money, he's asking for forgiveness of the debt. But he's not expecting it. He's just asking, knowing that it's a possibility. \n\nIs it unreasonable for him to make this request? Well, if they had an agreement that the debt would be forgiven under certain circumstances, maybe. But there's no indication they had that. However, when someone suddenly has a large windfall, it's not uncommon for people to ask for help with debts. The author might believe that since his girlfriend has the means now, she's willing to help him out. \n\nBut here's the thing: they had already set up a repayment plan. He's been working hard to pay her back, even to the point of cutting his expenses a lot. So maybe the debt was part of their mutual agreement. If she didn't mention forgiving it when she had the chance before, maybe the author should stick to the original plan. However, the sudden windfall changes things. The amount he's asking for is 3% of her winnings, which is significant but not unreasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems harsh, especially calling him an asshole. That's definitely a problem. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong for asking. The problem here is that the author might be conflating love and financial obligations. He feels that because he's been sacrificing a lot for her, she should reciprocate. However, the girlfriend might see the debt as separate from their relationship. She might feel that the debt exists independently of their personal feelings. \n\nThe author's approach to rationalizing his request by comparing percentages (3% vs. his monthly sacrifices) could be seen as trying to quantify love, which might have come off as manipulative or making her feel guilty. That's a red flag. Also, bringing up past sacrifices might not have been the best way to make his request. The way he handled the conversation might have been confrontational, leading to her defensive reaction.\n\nSo, was it wrong for him to ask? Maybe not entirely. People often ask for help when they get windfalls. But the way he approached the conversation could have been smoother. He might have been better off expressing his feelings without the percentages and focusing on mutual understanding rather than trying to justify it logically. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the debt was a financial agreement. The girlfriend has the right to choose not to forgive it, even if it's a windfall. The author's mistake might be in how he communicated his request, making it seem like an ultimatum or a judgment on her character. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's approach may have contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be partially in the wrong for how he framed the request, but the girlfriend's response was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. The main factor is whether asking for debt forgiveness is unreasonable. Since it's 3% of a windfall, it's a valid request. However, the way he approached it, comparing sacrifices and percentages, might have been the issue. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but his communication style was problematic. But according to the options, it's A for yes (author wrong) or B for no. \n\nGiven that, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because making the request isn't inherently wrong, but the way he handled the conversation may have been. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is that he's asking for forgiveness of a debt, which is a personal matter. If the girlfriend didn't agree to it, he's not in the wrong for asking. The girlfriend's harsh reaction is on her. So the answer is B.\n"
