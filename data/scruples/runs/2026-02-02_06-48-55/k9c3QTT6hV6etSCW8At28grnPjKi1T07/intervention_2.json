Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for requesting that their girlfriend forgive their 3,000\u20ac debt after she won 100,000\u20ac. \n\nFirst, the context: The author borrowed the money when they were in a tough spot\u2014no license, no car, and had to spend savings on those. The girlfriend lent them the money, and the author has been trying hard to pay it back, even cutting down on expenses. Now, after she wins a significant amount, the author asks for forgiveness of the debt. The girlfriend reacts harshly, calling the request disrespectful and ends up cutting off communication.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were in a financial crisis, the girlfriend helped them out, and now there's a chance to relieve that debt. The author didn't expect it but thought it was a reasonable request given the context. They tried to explain their reasoning, which led to an argument.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She lent the money under certain circumstances. The debt is part of their agreed terms. Even though she won money, it's her to do with as she pleases. The author's request might have felt like a betrayal of trust or a manipulation of her good fortune. Her harsh reaction might be due to feeling disrespected or that the author is taking her generosity for granted.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and communication. When the author borrowed the money, was it ever discussed that if she came into a windfall, the debt might be forgiven? If not, the author's assumption might be out of line. Additionally, the author's approach could have been better\u2014maybe a more gentle request instead of bringing up past sacrifices. The girlfriend's reaction, while harsh, could be due to feeling that the request was entitled or that the author didn't respect her financial boundaries.\n\nThe author might have thought the request was reasonable, but it's possible they didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective enough. The debt was a personal loan, and unless there was an agreement that it could be forgiven in such a scenario, the author might have overstepped. Also, the way the author framed their request, by comparing their own sacrifices, could have been perceived as guilt-tripping, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's upset.\n\nIn relationships, financial boundaries are crucial. If the author felt the need to ask, it's important to approach it with empathy and understanding of the other person's stance. The girlfriend's right to her money is valid, and the author's request might have crossed a line by implying that her financial gain should be used to erase the debt, especially without prior agreement.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might have been good, the approach and the underlying assumption could be seen as inconsiderate of the girlfriend's boundaries and the nature of the original loan. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
