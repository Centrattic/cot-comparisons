Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their significant other (SO) to forgive a \u20ac3000 debt after the SO won \u20ac100,000. \n\nFirst, the context: The user (m20) needed a car and a license to meet their GF (19), who didn't want to drive the 20-minute commute. He spent his savings on these, then had a car issue leading to a \u20ac3000 repair. Since he couldn't afford it, his GF lent him the money. He's been trying to repay her by cutting costs, even buying her small things when she refuses to spend her own money. Now, after her winning \u20ac100k, he asked if she could forgive the debt, but she reacted negatively, calling him out and leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He asked, not expecting, but he did ask. He felt he was making a reasonable request since the debt is a small percentage (3%) of her winnings. He also tried to explain his financial struggles and sacrifices to show that he's been giving a lot. He didn't mean to make her feel guilty but wanted her to understand his position.\n\nThe GF's perspective: She might feel that the debt was a loan, not a gift, and thus expects repayment. Her reaction could be about boundaries\u2014money vs. love. The comment \"I'm not someone like you\" suggests she feels he's using the financial angle in a way she's uncomfortable with, perhaps viewing it as transactional. The argument escalated when he tried to rationalize with numbers, which might have made her feel attacked.\n\nNow, considering the principles of relationships: Mutual respect, communication, and boundaries. The user did ask, which is okay, but the way he approached it (with numbers and comparison to his own sacrifices) might have been the issue. The GF had her own boundaries about money and felt disrespected. \n\nThe key points here are that the user didn't expect the money to be forgiven, but he asked. The GF had the right to say no, and the user's reaction of trying to justify his request by comparing sacrifices might have crossed a line. Relationships require respecting each other's values and boundaries, especially around money. The user's approach, while from a place of vulnerability, might have been insensitive to her boundaries, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong for making the request, but the way he handled the situation when it went south might not be. However, the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong for asking. Since he asked without expecting, it's not inherently wrong, but the subsequent argument was his fault in part. However, the initial request isn't the main issue. The GF's reaction is her choice, but the user isn't in the wrong for asking. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
