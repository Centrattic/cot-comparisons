Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (m20) who borrowed \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend (19) to fix his car. Now, after she won \u20ac100,000, he asked her (without expecting) if she could relieve him of the debt. She responded in an unexpected and hurtful way, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author had financial difficulties and his girlfriend helped him out. He's been trying to repay her, even going to extremes like only eating cheap dinners. Now, when she wins a large sum, he asks if she can forgive the debt. She's upset and ends up cutting him off.\n\nThe key points to consider: \n\n1. **Was the author's request reasonable?** The debt is 3% of her winnings. If she's willing to give it to her, it's a small part of her windfall. But does that make the request justified? The author didn't expect her to, but he asked. The question is whether he had the right to ask, even if it's a small amount relative to her win.\n\n2. **Communication issues:** The author didn't communicate his struggles to her before. He tried to rationalize by mentioning the numbers, which might have come off as confrontational. His approach might have been too abrupt or insensitive, especially if he didn't have prior discussions about this.\n\n3. **Her reaction:** She felt disrespected and called him an a**hole. Her response was harsh, but does that mean the author was in the wrong? Or was she overreacting? It's possible that she felt the question was a betrayal of trust, especially if they had an agreement when she lent the money that it had to be repaid regardless of future circumstances.\n\n4. **Expectations and boundaries:** When the girlfriend lent the money initially, were there any conditions? If it was a loan, then expecting repayment is standard. If it was a gift, then it's different. The author says she \"lent\" him the money, so he was supposed to pay it back. Asking for forgiveness after she wins money might seem like a breach of that agreement, especially if she didn't expect to be repaid when she made the loan.\n\n5. **Emotional aspect:** The author felt disrespected, and she felt that he was overstepping. Both might have valid points. The author's justification based on the percentage of her winnings is logical, but the girlfriend might see it as a personal issue, not a mathematical one.\n\n6. **Cultural context:** In some cultures, debt forgiveness after a windfall is common, but in others, loans are expected to be repaid regardless. The author's cultural background might influence his perspective.\n\n7. **Relationship dynamics:** The author was making sacrifices to repay her, but she didn't reciprocate in a way he felt was fair. However, the way he approached the request might have been insensitive, especially if he didn't discuss his feelings beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the initial agreement about the loan and how the request was phrased. If the loan was always intended to be repaid, then the author's request might be seen as reasonable, especially given the context of her windfall. However, if the way he approached it was confrontational or without prior discussion, that could be where he went wrong. The girlfriend's harsh reaction might be excessive, but it's her right to expect repayment if it was a loan. The key issue is whether the author had a right to ask for debt forgiveness, which he did, but the manner in which he did so might have contributed to the conflict. So, the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the request was reasonable given the circumstances, but communication could have been better.\n"
