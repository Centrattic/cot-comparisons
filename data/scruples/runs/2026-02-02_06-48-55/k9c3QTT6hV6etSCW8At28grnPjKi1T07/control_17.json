Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author, a 20-year-old guy, had no driver's license or car. His girlfriend, also 19, wanted him to get both so they could see each other more easily without relying on public transport, which wasn't convenient. He bought a car and got his license. Then later, when his car had a serious issue, he needed 3,000 Euros to fix it. He didn't have the money, so his girlfriend lent it to him. Now, he's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like eating cheap dinners or skipping them to save money. He mentions that he's grateful and doesn't mind doing this. \n\nThe problem arises when the girlfriend wins 100,000 Euros in a raffle. The author asks her if she can forgive the debt, or at least part of it. Her response is dismissive and hurtful. She laughs at him, says she loves him but draws the line at money, and that 3,000 is a lot. She also says she's sure he would do this for her anytime, implying he's more willing to spend for her than she is. The author feels disrespected, especially by the \"not somebody like you\" comment. When he explains his sacrifices and feels the need to rationalize his request, she gets angry, calls him an asshole, and ends the communication.\n\nHe's asking if he was in the wrong for making the request or trying to rationalize it. The key points here are about expectations in a relationship regarding money, communication styles, and whether the debt forgiveness was a reasonable ask.\n\nThe author didn't force her to help him initially; she lent him the money out of generosity. Now, he's asking her to forgive the debt after she won a large sum. The question is: is this a fair request? \n\nOn one hand, the author made a loan agreement and is trying to repay it. If the girlfriend had known that the debt might be forgiven if she won money, that could be different. But he didn't specify terms when she lent the money, so maybe he's now making a new request. It's possible that she expected the debt to be fully repaid, as loans typically are, especially since she had her own financial aversion and was struggling to spend money on small things. \n\nHowever, the situation is that he's been making significant personal sacrifices to repay her, and when she wins a substantial amount, he sees an opportunity to have the debt forgiven. He's comparing his sacrifices (spending a higher percentage of his savings on her gifts) to the 3% she could afford from her 100k. The author didn't communicate his struggles before, so when he brings them up, she might feel it's a manipulation tactic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is clearly harsh, but the author's approach might have been lacking in empathy. He might have made his request in a way that felt like he was keeping score or implying that his financial sacrifices outweigh hers. Even if he didn't mean to, bringing up the math and comparing percentages could come off as trying to make her feel guilty. \n\nIn relationships, financial expectations can be tricky. The author might not be wrong for asking, especially if he felt it was a fair request given the circumstances. However, the way he framed his argument\u2014by emphasizing his own sacrifices and the percentage of her winnings\u2014might have been offensive. It's possible that the girlfriend felt the debt was a personal sacrifice she made, and having it forgiven now after her win is unexpected and perhaps resented. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he had communicated his financial struggles earlier, maybe she would have considered forgiving the debt sooner. But since he didn't, and now the request is coming after a win which she might not have expected to be used for that purpose, maybe he's overstepping. However, the girlfriend's response was also very harsh and dismissive, which is probably more in the wrong. \n\nThe author's intention was to ask, not to guilt-trip her. But by bringing up the math, he might have made it seem transactional. The key is whether the request was made in a way that considered their mutual understanding. Since he felt she was upset because he didn't communicate his sacrifices before, that might have contributed to her defensive reaction. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making the request, but perhaps the way he followed up with the rationalization and comparison was what caused the conflict. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's response, which seems more extreme. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the perspective. If he had asked without the guilt-trip math, maybe she would have considered it. But given how he presented it, maybe he did cross a line. Still, the core of the problem is her reaction. I think the author's initial request wasn't wrong, but the follow-up might have been. However, the main fault is on her for reacting so negatively. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
