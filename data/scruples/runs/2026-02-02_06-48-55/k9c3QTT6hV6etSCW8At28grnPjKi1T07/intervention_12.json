Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author's SO lent them 3,000\u20ac, and after the SO won 100,000\u20ac, the author asked if she could forgive the debt. The SO reacted harshly, and now the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author borrowed money from their SO to fix a car. They've been trying to pay it back, even making sacrifices. Now, when the SO wins a lot of money, the author asks if the debt can be forgiven. The SO is upset, and the author is confused because they feel it's a small percentage of the winnings.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the debt and the expectations. When someone lends money, especially in a romantic relationship, there can be different understandings. If it was a formal loan with the expectation of repayment, then the author is within their rights to ask for forgiveness, but the SO is under no obligation. However, if the loan was more of a gesture of support, the author might be assuming a different dynamic.\n\nThe author's approach might have come off as transactional. By bringing up the debt after the SO won money and highlighting the percentage (3% of 100k), the author could be making the SO feel pressured or resented. The SO's reaction is strong, but it's also possible that the author didn't set clear expectations from the start. They might have implied that repayment wasn't necessary, or maybe they expected forgiveness as a gift.\n\nAlso, the author's history of sacrificing to repay the debt shows they take it seriously. However, when asking for forgiveness after the SO's windfall, they might not have considered the SO's perspective. The SO might feel that the debt was a personal sacrifice and not something to be waived just because she won money. The author's attempt to rationalize the request by comparing it to their own sacrifices could have come across as guilt-tripping, which is why the SO reacted angrily.\n\nIn relationships, money can be a sensitive topic. The author might not be in the wrong for asking, but their method of asking and the context could have been problematic. They didn't set boundaries initially and then tried to renegotiate the terms after the fact, which the SO found disrespectful. The SO's reaction is extreme, but the author's approach might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate clearly from the start and their method of asking for forgiveness after the fact could be seen as taking advantage of the SO's situation. Alternatively, if the debt was always intended to be repaid, the author isn't in the wrong for asking. It's a bit of a gray area, but the way they approached it might have crossed a line.\n"
