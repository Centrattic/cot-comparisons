Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The situation involves the author asking their girlfriend to forgive a 3000\u20ac debt after she won 100,000\u20ac, but she reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author borrowed the money from the girlfriend to fix their car, which was a significant expense. They've been trying to pay her back by cutting costs on their own, like cheap meals. The girlfriend, who is described as someone who hates spending money, has been buying small things for the author, which he pays for with his limited funds. \n\nWhen the girlfriend wins 100,000\u20ac, the author asks if she could forgive the debt. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, laughing at him, saying she drew a line at money, and implying that the author is different from her. The author felt disrespected and tried to explain his side, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't expect her to forgive the debt, just asked. Given that her winnings are a large sum, 3000\u20ac is a small percentage. The author's request seems reasonable from a financial standpoint. However, the girlfriend might feel that the debt was a personal loan, and she's within her rights to not forgive it. But the way she reacted\u2014mocking and disrespecting\u2014seems harsh. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to ask? The author was in a tough spot, had a history of financial support, and the request is a small fraction of her winnings. The girlfriend's response was unkind, which might not be the author's fault. The author's attempt to rationalize his request with numbers might have been unwise, but the core question is whether the request was unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend had a choice to forgive the debt, and the author's request was a legitimate one. The harsh response from her is the main issue here. The author's actions, while perhaps a bit defensive when explaining, were in response to feeling disrespected. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The main fault lies with the girlfriend's reaction rather than the initial request.\n"
