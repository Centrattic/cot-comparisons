Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to forgive a 3,000\u20ac debt after she won 100,000\u20ac. The main points here are about communication, expectations in a relationship, and how the request was made and received.\n\nFirst, the author didn't have the money for a car or driving license and the GF lent it to them. They've been trying to pay her back, cutting costs to the bone. Then, when the GF wins 100k, the author asks for debt relief, but the GF reacts harshly, laughing and calling the author an asshole. The author feels disrespected and is now unsure if they were wrong to ask and rationalize their request.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: was the request reasonable? The 3k is a small fraction of the 100k (3%), which seems like a lot. The author was in a tough spot, using their savings and struggling to repay. But the GF might see the debt as a boundary they set when lending the money, even if they later win money. The way the author approached the request is important. They mention they didn't expect her to forgive it but asked anyway. The GF's reaction is emotional and negative, which could stem from feeling that the author is taking advantage of her good fortune. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the GF didn't appreciate the justification, leading to a fight.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author might feel the debt is a burden and the GF's win provides an opportunity to alleviate that. However, the GF might see the debt as a personal sacrifice and resent the implication that she should use her windfall for his benefit. The author's method of bringing it up might have been too direct after the GF's positive news, leading to a defensive reaction. Also, the author's rationalization (comparing the debt to their monthly sacrifices) could have come off as trying to guilt her into forgiving the debt, which might be why she felt disrespected. The GF's response was certainly harsh, but the author's approach might have contributed to the conflict. So, the author's intentions were understandable, but the way they handled it and the rationalization could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with consideration that the approach had issues. However, the question is a strict A or B. Since the author's request was for a small portion of a windfall and they had been trying to repay, it's debatable if they're in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
