Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a guy (the author) who borrowed 3,000\u20ac from his girlfriend (GF) to fix his car after he spent his savings on a car and driving license. He's been repaying her bit by bit, even cutting back on expenses like cheap dinners. Now, she won 100,000\u20ac and he asked her to forgive his debt. She laughed at him, said no, and got angry when he tried to explain his reasoning, leading to a fight and her cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author borrowed money from his GF. Even though it was for their relationship's benefit (so they can meet more easily without public transport), it's still a loan. The GF lent it to him when he couldn't afford it. Now, after she got a large sum, he's asking her to write off the debt. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The loan was between the couple. Did they agree on terms when she lent it? If it was a loan, then the author might be expected to pay it back unless they had a prior agreement that it could be forgiven under certain circumstances. The GF might feel that he's being greedy or not respecting her financial boundaries.\n2. The author's approach to asking. He says he was \"asking\" not expecting, but the GF took it as a demand. How he framed the request could matter. If it's perceived as a demand, especially after months of repayment, it might come off as taking her generosity for granted.\n3. The GF's reaction. She laughed, said no, and then got angry when he tried to justify his request. Her tone and the comment \"I'm just not somebody like you\" could indicate that she feels he's exploiting her or not understanding her perspective. Her being upset might be because she feels he's attacking her values or implying she's stingy.\n4. The author's defense using percentages (3,000\u20ac is 3% of her win vs. his monthly sacrifices). This seems like he's trying to equate his sacrifices to her potential forgiveness, which might be seen as putting a price on their relationship. The GF might find that offensive, as she might believe that love shouldn't be transactional.\n5. The aftermath: The author tried to explain his side, leading to her anger. Now he's conflicted about apologizing because he still feels she was harsh, but he also wants to reconcile.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are crucial. The author might have been grateful initially for the loan, but when she was in a position to forgive it, he felt entitled. The GF might have felt that by not forgiving, he's being disrespectful, and when he brought up the percentages, it could have made her feel like he's calculating her love. \n\nThe author's mistake could be in how he approached the request. Even if it's not a financial obligation, the way he brought up the numbers might have made it seem like he's keeping track in a way that's hurtful. The GF's reaction was harsh, but the author's attempt to rationalize by comparing their financial contributions could have escalated the conflict. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for asking, but his method and the way he defended his request could be problematic. He didn't consider her feelings about the transaction and her boundaries. The GF's response was also harsh, but the initial request's tone and the subsequent justification might have crossed a line. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the core issue is about how he approached the forgiveness of a personal loan, possibly making it seem transactional and not respecting her initial agreement. However, there's nuance here. If there was no agreement on the loan terms, maybe the GF should have been more understanding. But the act of asking her to forgive a debt after she helped him, even if it's small compared to her windfall, could be seen as taking advantage or not respecting her initial support. The way he justified it by comparing percentages might have been the immediate trigger for her harsh reaction, which is why he's in the wrong in how he handled the situation.\n"
