Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic partner (SO) who won 100,000\u20ac and the writer is asking if their SO should forgive their 3,000\u20ac debt. The SO reacted negatively, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer took on the debt after buying a car and getting a license, which was necessary for their relationship. They were already struggling financially and couldn't afford to fix the car, so their SO lent them the money. Now, after the SO wins a large sum, the writer is asking for forgiveness of the debt.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The writer didn't explicitly ask for the debt to be forgiven before the SO won the money. They were paying it back, albeit with difficulty. When the opportunity arises for the SO to forgive the debt, the writer makes a request. The SO's reaction is harsh, which is the crux of the problem.\n\nBut is the writer in the wrong? Well, they didn't make the request as a demand, just an ask. However, the SO might feel that the debt was a loan that the writer was already repaying, so there's no obligation for the SO to forgive it, especially since they didn't agree beforehand. The writer's approach to rationalizing the request with percentages might have come off as calculating, which could have upset the SO. The line about \"not being someone like me\" suggests the SO felt disrespected, which is a valid reaction if the writer implied the SO wasn't generous enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer was in a tough spot, trying to manage their finances while maintaining the relationship. They were making sacrifices to repay the debt, so their request might be seen as a way to relieve some pressure. However, the way they framed the request, especially bringing up their sacrifices, could have been unbalanced and made the SO feel criticized.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The writer's request is understandable given their situation, but the way they communicated it and the timing might have been off. The SO's reaction is harsh, but they might have felt that the debt was a personal loan that wasn't supposed to be forgiven. The writer might have overstepped by implying the SO wasn't as generous as they were, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for how they approached the situation, even if their request was reasonable.\n"
