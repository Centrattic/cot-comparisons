Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their girlfriend to forgive a 3,000\u20ac debt after she won 100,000\u20ac. The girlfriend got upset and ended the conversation, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author borrowed money from their girlfriend to fix their car, which was necessary because they didn't have a car and needed it for their relationship. They've been making payments, sometimes sacrificing their own expenses. Now, after she wins a large sum, he asks to have the debt forgiven. The girlfriend felt disrespected and rejected the request, which led to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to ask for the debt to be forgiven? Was the way he approached it wrong? The author mentions they didn't expect the money but still asked. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, but was the author's request reasonable?\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, 3,000\u20ac is a small portion of 100,000\u20ac (3%). However, personal relationships add complexity. Even though it's a small percentage, the girlfriend might view the debt as a personal transaction rather than a gift. The author's reasoning is that he's been making sacrifices to pay her back, so when she has the means, he felt it was fair to ask for relief. \n\nBut the way he framed his request could be problematic. He compared their financial sacrifices, which might have come off as trying to guilt-trip her. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014laughing, saying she's not \"like me\"\u2014indicates she felt the request was manipulative. The author's defense about percentages and his own sacrifices might have been seen as justification rather than empathy for her feelings about the money.\n\nThe question is whether the request itself was wrong. While he had a valid reason for the debt, the timing and manner of the request could have been insensitive. People have different values about money, and the girlfriend's stance that she drew a line at money might mean she never intended to forgive the debt, regardless of her newfound wealth. The author might not have considered her boundaries and approached the request as if it were a given, leading to her feeling disrespected.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for asking, but the way he approached the request and the subsequent argument could have been handled better. However, based on the girlfriend's reaction and the fact that he tried to rationalize his request with his own sacrifices, it's possible the author overstepped, making him at least partially at fault. However, whether he's in the wrong entirely depends on whether the request itself was reasonable. Since he didn't expect the money but still asked, and the debt was a personal loan, the answer might lean towards the author not being entirely wrong, but his approach was flawed.\n"
