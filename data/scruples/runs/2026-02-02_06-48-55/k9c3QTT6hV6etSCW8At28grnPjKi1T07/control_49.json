Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (m20) borrowed \u20ac3,000 from their girlfriend (19) to fix their car. They've been trying to pay her back by cutting costs significantly. When the girlfriend wins \u20ac100,000, the author asks if she can forgive the debt or part of it. Her response is dismissive and harsh, leading to a breakup. The author is questioning if their request was wrong.\n\nNow, analyzing the key points. The debt was a loan between partners, not a gift. The author has been paying it back, so it's not like they never intended to repay. The timing is when the girlfriend won a large sum. The author's request is not out of need but possibly to ease their financial burden since they've been sacrificing a lot. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about the principle of mixing money and relationships, perhaps feeling that the debt should be honored regardless of their newfound wealth.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, asking to have the debt forgiven because they have the means now isn't inherently wrong. However, the context is important. The debt was a loan, so expecting it to be forgiven might be seen as unfair to the lender, especially if no terms were set about such scenarios. The author did acknowledge the debt and was repaying it, so maybe the request comes off as trying to renegotiate after the fact. Also, the way the author tried to justify it by comparing their sacrifices could be seen as guilt-tripping, which might be why the girlfriend reacted negatively.\n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend's response was disrespectful and dismissive, which is problematic. The author's request, while perhaps a bit impulsive, was out of a genuine effort to reduce their financial stress, given the circumstances. The girlfriend's refusal without empathy could be her being in the wrong here.\n\nSo balancing both sides: The author's request isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach might have been. However, the girlfriend's reaction was clearly hurtful. The key point is that the debt was a loan, and the author was repaying it. The request to forgive part of it when the lender suddenly has the means isn't unreasonable. However, the author might not have considered the terms of the loan when it was made. If there was an understanding that it would be repaid regardless, then the author's request could be seen as breaking that trust. But the girlfriend's harsh response also indicates a lack of empathy towards the author's sacrifices.\n\nGiven that, the answer might hinge on whether the loan terms were clear. Since the original agreement wasn't specified here, it's ambiguous. However, the author's intent wasn't to take advantage but to ease their burden, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction, however, was disproportionate. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
