Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (m20) and his girlfriend (19), who lent him \u20ac3,000 to fix his car. Now that she won \u20ac100,000, he asked to have the debt forgiven or at least part of it, but she reacted strongly negatively, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author took a significant financial risk by spending his savings on a car and license. He didn't mention family help, so it's clear he was on his own. The girlfriend lent him the money, which he's been trying to pay back, even going to the extent of cutting costs drastically. He's been giving her expensive gifts relative to his budget, which she might not realize the sacrifice it takes.\n\nWhen he asked her to forgive the debt after her windfall, he wasn't expecting it but felt it was a reasonable request. She, however, was clearly uncomfortable. Her reaction of laughing, then being dismissive and disrespectful, especially the \"I'm not someone like you\" comment, is problematic. Even if she felt the request was out of line, her response was harsh and unkind.\n\nThe author tried to explain his position by highlighting the financial sacrifices he made, which he never discussed before. This might have come off as accusatory or as trying to justify his request with numbers, rather than emotional reasoning. However, given that she was so dismissive, it's possible he felt justified in defending himself. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. When she lent the \u20ac3,000, there was an agreement, and the author didn't expect her to forgive it. After her win, he approached her with a request, which is reasonable. However, bringing up the financial sacrifices during an argument might have escalated things. The girlfriend's reaction was more about how she felt about the request and the way it was brought up, but her harshness is still an issue.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The author might have overstepped by using the windfall to question past financial decisions, but her response was equally, if not more, disrespectful. The phrase \"I'm not someone like you\" is particularly hurtful and suggests a lack of empathy or understanding.\n\nSo, while the author could have approached the request more sensitively, the primary issue is her reaction. She had the right to say no, but her delivery was cruel. The author isn't entirely in the wrong here because he had a legitimate request based on their previous arrangement and his sacrifices. However, the way he defended himself by listing his financial struggles might have made her feel attacked, which complicates the matter. Still, her response was the more egregious part.\n"
