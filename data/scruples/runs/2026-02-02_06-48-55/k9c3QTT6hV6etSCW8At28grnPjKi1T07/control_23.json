Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (m20) and their girlfriend (19) who won \u20ac100,000 in a raffle. The author had previously borrowed \u20ac3,000 from her to fix their car, and after she won the money, they asked if she could forgive the debt. The girlfriend reacted negatively, laughed at them, said the money was a lot, and called the author an a**hole, leading to a breakup-like situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had financial struggles, used savings to get a license and car, then had a car repair that they couldn't afford. The girlfriend lent the money, which the author is trying to pay back by cutting expenses. When the girlfriend wins a large sum, the author asks if the debt can be forgiven. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, and the author feels disrespected.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions of both parties.\n\nThe author's actions: They asked to have the debt forgiven after the girlfriend won a significant amount. The author didn't expect it but thought it was a possibility. They were trying to rationalize their request by mentioning their sacrifices, which might have come off as making her feel guilty. The author might have overstepped by bringing up past sacrifices when the girlfriend was already upset.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She lent money out of generosity, and when asked to forgive the debt, she felt disrespected by the request. Her reaction was abrupt and hurtful, which could indicate that she felt the request was ungrateful or taken advantage of. She also made a comment implying that the author is different from her in terms of handling money, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, when someone lends money, there's an implicit agreement that it's a loan to be repaid. The author is trying to renegotiate that agreement after a windfall, which is understandable but might be seen as taking advantage of her generosity. However, the author's financial situation and the context of the loan (helping with car repairs due to no other options) might mitigate that. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has the right to decide what to do with her windfall. Her reaction was harsh, but the request might have been a trigger for her not wanting to lose the money she worked hard to earn.\n\nThe author's attempt to rationalize by comparing their sacrifices could be seen as guilt-tripping, which can be offensive. The way the author presented their case might have focused more on their own struggles rather than respecting her autonomy in deciding how to use her winnings. This could have made her feel attacked, hence her defensive and angry response.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's request isn't inherently wrong\u2014people do sometimes ask for loan forgiveness in such situations. However, the way the request was framed and followed up might have crossed a line. The girlfriend's reaction was also harsh, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the author might be partly at fault for not considering the girlfriend's perspective and potentially using guilt-tripping tactics. However, the primary issue is the girlfriend's reaction. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. The key point is whether the author had the right to ask, and if their approach was respectful. Since the author didn't expect the forgiveness but still made the request, and then explained their sacrifices when she said no, which might have been the wrong move. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just whether they could have done better.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because asking for loan forgiveness after a windfall isn't inherently wrong, though their approach could have been more considerate. The main fault lies with the girlfriend's harsh reaction.\n"
