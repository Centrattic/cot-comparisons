Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person borrowed 3,000 euros from their girlfriend (SO) to fix their car. Now, the girlfriend won 100,000 euros in a raffle. The author asked if she could forgive the debt, maybe all or part of it. The girlfriend became upset, laughed, called the author an a**hole, and told him to f*** off. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author took on debt to fix their car, which was necessary because they needed a car to meet up with their girlfriend. They had no savings left and couldn't get help from family. The girlfriend lent them the money. Now, after winning a large sum, the author asked if she could forgive the debt. \n\nThe key points here are intent and communication. The author didn't expect an answer but asked. The girlfriend reacted very harshly. The author tried to explain their financial struggles, and when they brought up the math (3,000 out of 100k is 3%), the girlfriend was offended. The author felt disrespected because of her response, which included \"I'm just not somebody like you\" and the other harsh words.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The act of asking for debt forgiveness isn't inherently wrong. The context is that the debt was incurred to maintain their relationship (since the girlfriend wanted the car so they could meet). The author was trying to repay it through sacrifices, which the girlfriend was aware of. When the opportunity arose (her winning money), he asked for relief. \n\nHowever, the way the author approached it might be problematic. They mention that they asked but didn't expect an answer. But when they tried to rationalize their request by comparing their sacrifices to her 3%, maybe that came off as trying to guilt-trip her or make a comparison that she found offensive. The author's defense might have escalated the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was unkind, but her right to refuse the request is hers. The author's issue is that they felt disrespected, but the girlfriend's right to say no is valid. However, the author's attempt to justify their request by pointing out the percentage might have made it seem transactional. \n\nIn relationships, money can be a touchy subject. The author's actions were based on their need and gratitude, but their communication might have crossed a line by implying that the girlfriend wasn't as selfless as they were. The phrase \"I'm just not somebody like you\" suggests that the girlfriend felt the author was accusing her of being selfish, which could be a sensitive point. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? They asked a legitimate question, but their approach in defending their request might have been too logical or transactional, which hurt the girlfriend. The author's intention wasn't malicious, but their communication style might have been the issue. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the author not being entirely in the wrong, but their approach had flaws. But since the options are A (yes) or B (no), based on whether they are in the wrong. Given that the author's request was reasonable but their method of justifying it might have been hurtful, the answer is likely B (no), the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
