Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author, a 20-year-old male, took on a debt of \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend, who is 19, to buy a car and get his license. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like eating cheaply. Now, she won \u20ac100,000 in a raffle, and he asked her to forgive the debt. She snapped at him, laughed, and said she wouldn't do it, which hurt him. He tried to rationalize his request by pointing out the percentage (3% of her winnings), but she got angry and called him an a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. He asked her to forgive the debt after she won a large sum, but the article is called \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). The key here is whether his request was unreasonable.\n\nHe borrowed the money, so he has a debt. Even though she won money later, he's asking her to forgive it. Is that a reasonable request? Well, when someone lends money, the expectation is usually repayment unless agreed otherwise. However, if the lender has the means to forgive it, is the borrower in the wrong for asking? Or is the lender in the wrong for refusing in a disrespectful way?\n\nThe author mentions that he's been paying her back, but even after she won the prize, he asked for forgiveness. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh and disrespectful, which is a problem. But the question is whether the request itself is wrong. \n\nSome might argue that he shouldn't have expected her to forgive the debt, especially since he had agreed to pay her back. However, considering the context where he's been making sacrifices to repay her, and she's now in a position to help, maybe it's a bit more nuanced. However, forgiveness of debt isn't a right; it's a choice of the lender. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asking, but he might have approached it poorly. The way he rationalized it by comparing percentages might have come off as calculating or manipulative, which could have triggered her response.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is unkind and disrespectful, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to ask. However, the fact that he took out the loan in the first place for a car and license she wanted him to get could imply that the loan was partly for their relationship's benefit. But that's a stretch. The main issue is whether the request was unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers intentions and context. The author's intention was to seek forgiveness after the lender had the means. The lender's refusal, especially in a disrespectful manner, might make her the \"asshole,\" but the question is about the author. If the request itself is not inherently wrong, then the answer would be B (No). However, if the way he asked was inappropriate or if he shouldn't have expected forgiveness, then A (Yes).\n\nAnother angle: the author might have breached some emotional boundaries by bringing up the debt in a personal context. The girlfriend's anger could be because he reduced the emotional value of her help into a transactional exchange. But that's more about how he approached it rather than the request itself being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's request isn't inherently wrong, but his approach might have been. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is likely B (No). The main issue is the girlfriend's harsh reaction, not the request itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
