Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. So, the author's story is about asking their significant other (SO) to forgive a \u20ac3,000 debt after she won \u20ac100,000 in a raffle. The SO got angry and ended the conversation, and now the author is wondering if they were wrong to ask.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author borrowed \u20ac3,000 from their GF to fix their car. They've been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, like eating cheaply. Now, after the GF wins a large sum, the author asks if she can forgive the debt. The GF reacts harshly, saying no and making the author feel disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think about the factors here. Borrowing money from a partner is a common issue. The key points are: whether the author had a right to ask for forgiveness after the win, how they framed the request, and the GF's reaction.\n\nThe author didn't expect the GF to forgive the debt but still asked. They mentioned that the \u20ac3,000 is 3% of her winnings. The GF's response was disrespectful, but the author is now questioning if their approach was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, financial boundaries are important. If the initial loan was agreed upon, the author might have an obligation unless there was a prior agreement to forgive it. However, when the GF won money, the author thought it was a good opportunity to ask. But the way they presented it\u2014maybe by comparing their sacrifices to hers\u2014could come off as accusatory, which might have triggered the GF's defensiveness.\n\nThe GF's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. However, the author's approach to rationalizing their request with percentages and pointing out their sacrifices might have been perceived as guilt-tripping. Even if the request was reasonable, the delivery could have been a problem. Also, the author didn't mention discussing the loan terms from the start, so maybe there was an expectation that the debt would be repaid regardless of future windfalls.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for asking, especially if they were trying to manage their finances, but the way they approached the conversation could have been more considerate. However, the GF's response was clearly inappropriate. The question is whether the author's request was the root of the issue. If the loan was a mutual agreement, the author might have an obligation, but the timing and framing of the request after a windfall could be seen as taking advantage, even if unintentionally. Alternatively, the GF's reaction is more indicative of the problem in the relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone lends money, especially in a relationship, expectations can vary. If the GF was generous initially, the author might feel it's fair to ask for forgiveness when presented with the opportunity. However, the GF might see the debt as a past transaction that shouldn't be renegotiated now. The author's use of percentages and comparing their sacrifices might have crossed a line, making the request seem manipulative. The key is whether the request was framed as a selfish demand or a mutual discussion. The author's approach here might have been too transactional, leading the GF to feel disrespected. So, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, their method of rationalizing it might have been. Therefore, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that their approach could have been better.\n"
