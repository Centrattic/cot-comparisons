Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation: the author borrowed 3,000 euros from their girlfriend (now ex?) when they were in a tough spot because their car broke down. They were working on paying it back by cutting costs, like eating cheap dinners. Then, the girlfriend won 100,000 euros in a raffle. The author asked her to forgive the debt, at least partly. The girlfriend reacted harshly, laughed at them, said they were joking, and called the author an a**hole before breaking off contact. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to ask.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author did take a loan from their partner when they were in need. They made an effort to repay it, even sacrificing their own expenses. When the partner won a large sum, the author thought it might be a chance to get relief from the debt. The partner, however, was very defensive and upset.\n\nFirst, is the author in the wrong for asking? Well, the author didn't expect repayment initially, but after the girlfriend won money, they thought maybe it's possible. But was it reasonable to ask? The author had a legitimate debt, and when the partner had a windfall, it's not uncommon for people to consider if they can forgive debts. However, the context is a personal relationship, not a business transaction. So, the author might have thought it's a fair request, but the girlfriend might see it as a boundary issue.\n\nThe girlfriend had given the loan before, possibly expecting repayment. If she agreed to the loan terms, then the author's asking for forgiveness after a windfall could be seen as renegotiating the terms without prior agreement. However, in personal relationships, especially with partners, there's often flexibility. The problem here is communication. The author didn't discuss the potential of debt relief before the raffle win. The girlfriend might have felt that the debt was a personal responsibility the author took on, and the author's asking for forgiveness now is taking advantage of her good fortune.\n\nThe way the girlfriend reacted was harsh and disrespectful. The author's approach might have been too direct or caught her off guard. But the author's intention was to seek relief, not to pressure. The girlfriend's response of laughing and calling the author an a**hole is clearly inappropriate, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to ask. The author had a right to express their situation, especially since they were struggling to repay the debt through significant sacrifices.\n\nThe author tried to rationalize their request by comparing their own sacrifices to the 3% of the windfall, which could come off as trying to make the girlfriend feel guilty. That might have been a misstep in communication. Instead of focusing on percentages, maybe they should have approached it more emotionally, explaining their hardship without comparing it to the girlfriend's spending habits. However, the core issue is whether the request itself was wrong. Since the author was in a real financial struggle and the girlfriend had a means to help, it's not entirely unreasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from a strict view of personal financial boundaries. She might have felt that the debt was a personal loan she had to repay, and the author's request was crossing a line. The phrase \"I'm just not somebody like you\" suggests she might have felt the author was trying to manipulate the situation, which could be a defense mechanism. The author's attempt to explain their sacrifices might have been seen as an accusation, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: the author isn't in the wrong for asking for debt relief, especially after a windfall. However, the way they presented it (focusing on percentages and their own sacrifices) might have been tactless. The girlfriend's response was definitely disrespectful, but the author's initial request, while understandable, might have been inconsiderate of the girlfriend's perspective. The core issue is the lack of prior discussion about the debt and financial expectations in their relationship. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are elements of miscommunication and possibly setting unclear expectations. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the request itself was reasonable given the circumstances, even if the execution could have been better.\n"
