Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their significant other to forgive a 3,000\u20ac debt after the SO won 100,000\u20ac. The author provided a detailed backstory.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author (m20) borrowed 3,000\u20ac from their GF to fix their car. They've been paying her back by cutting costs, like eating cheap meals. The SO won 100k, and the author asked her to forgive the debt. The GF reacted harshly, leading to a breakup. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nLet's break it down. The key points are:\n\n1. The author borrowed money in a time of need, which the GF helped with. They've been trying to repay it.\n2. The author asked to have the debt forgiven after the GF won a large sum. The GF felt disrespected by the request and the author's attempt to explain their sacrifices.\n3. The GF's reaction was extreme, but the author's approach might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the debt was a loan, not a gift. When you lend money, there's an expectation of repayment unless agreed otherwise. The author did take the debt out, so they have a responsibility to pay it back. However, after the GF's windfall, the author is asking for forgiveness. The GF might feel that she was already generous by lending the money in the first place, and now the author is expecting her to give up 3% of her winnings. The author's framing of their sacrifices (spending cuts) might have come off as implying the GF isn't contributing enough, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe GF's reaction is certainly harsh, especially the \"I'm not like you\" comment, which is hurtful. However, the author's approach to asking might have been problematic. They might not have considered the GF's boundaries around money. The debt was a loan, and the author's request to forgive it after the fact could be seen as taking advantage, especially since the author didn't mention their sacrifices during the repayment period. The author's attempt to rationalize using percentages and comparing their contributions might have made the GF feel attacked, leading to her anger.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, but the way they approached it and their subsequent explanation could have been better. The expectation to have the debt forgiven, even partially, after the fact might be seen as expecting more than what was initially agreed. The GF's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions also contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author shares some responsibility, but it's not entirely their fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the debt terms and the context, the author might have overstepped by expecting forgiveness without prior agreement. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
