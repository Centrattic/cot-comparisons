Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's partner won 100,000 euros and he asked her to forgive his 3,000 euro debt. She reacted negatively, and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author borrowed 3,000 euros from his girlfriend to fix his car. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs, which he's been okay with. Then, when she wins money, he asks if she could relieve him of the debt. She's upset and says things that hurt him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't expect her to say yes, but he felt it was a reasonable request given her windfall. She, on the other hand, might feel that he's taking advantage of her good fortune. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for making the request.\n\nIn relationships, money can be a sensitive topic. The author had a prior agreement to pay her back, so he might believe that in light of her winning money, it's a way to ease the burden. However, she might see this as him expecting something from her luck, even though she already helped him before.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's been sacrificing a lot to pay her back, so using a small portion of her 100k to forgive the debt makes sense. But the way he brought up the sacrifices and compared it to her reaction might have come off as confrontational. When he tried to rationalize his request by mentioning his efforts, she got angry, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, by asking for a debt forgiveness, he's within his right if that's what they agreed upon. However, the manner in which he approached it and the comparison he made might have been disrespectful. The girlfriend had already helped him, and the author's approach could be seen as pushing for more, which she might not feel comfortable with. Additionally, bringing up the sacrifices to justify his request might have made her feel guilty or attacked, which escalated the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was harsh and dismissive. She laughed, called him an a**hole, and told him to f*** off, which is clearly hurtful. The author might have felt disrespected, but the question is about whether he was in the wrong for making the request. The debt was a mutual agreement, so he's not legally in the wrong. However, in a relationship, expecting a favor after a significant event (like winning money) can be subjective. The key is whether the request was reasonable given their relationship dynamics.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for asking, but the way he handled the conversation, especially bringing up the sacrifices, might have contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend's response was also inappropriate. However, the initial request itself isn't inherently wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
