Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author (m20) who borrowed \u20ac3,000 from his girlfriend after her help with buying a car and fixing it. Now, the girlfriend won \u20ac100,000, and the author asked her to forgive the debt. Her reaction was harsh, leading to a breakup-like situation. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline and actions. The author spent his savings on a car and license. When the car broke down, he couldn't afford repairs, so his girlfriend lent him \u20ac3,000. He's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs. Now, after she wins \u20ac100k, he asks her to waive the debt, which she refuses, and he tries to justify it by comparing their spending habits. She responds angrily, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The debt was a loan, not a gift. 2) The author is asking for forgiveness of a debt after a windfall. 3) His approach might have been too confrontational, bringing up past sacrifices. 4) The girlfriend might feel disrespected by the request and the way it was presented.\n\nLegally, if it was a loan, she's not obligated to forgive it. Emotionally, the author's request could be seen as pressuring her, especially after she had already agreed to the loan. The way he tried to rationalize his request by comparing their spending might have made her feel accused. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he could have approached the situation differently. Instead of framing it as a logical request after a windfall, maybe he should have had a more empathetic conversation, acknowledging her perspective first. Also, bringing up past sacrifices could come off as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was harsh. She shouldn't have laughed and dismissed the request so disrespectfully, especially after he had been trying to repay her. However, the author's approach might have triggered her defenses, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the question is whether the author had the right to ask for debt forgiveness. Since it was a loan, he's in a weaker position. His justification using percentages might not consider her financial priorities. But he wasn't expecting her to say yes, just asking. However, the way he presented it could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author had the right to make such a request given the context of a loan. If the debt was understood as a loan with repayment terms, then the author might be wrong to expect forgiveness. But if there was an implicit understanding that she might forgive it, maybe not. But since she didn't agree to that, his asking could be seen as crossing a line, especially with the confrontational approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he made a request for debt forgiveness that was a loan, possibly in a way that was disrespectful to her position, leading to conflict.\n"
