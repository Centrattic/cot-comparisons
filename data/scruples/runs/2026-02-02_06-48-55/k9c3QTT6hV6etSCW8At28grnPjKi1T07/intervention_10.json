Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend won 100,000\u20ac and he asked her to forgive the 3,000\u20ac debt he had from helping with his car and license. But her reaction was harsh, and now they're having issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author was in a financial situation where he needed help, and the girlfriend lent him the money. That was a kind gesture, and he's been trying to pay her back by cutting costs. Now, when she wins a large sum, he asks if she can forgive the debt. The key point is whether the author had the right to make that request.\n\nThe user says he didn't expect her to do it but still asked. The problem is how she reacted, but maybe the request itself is where the issue is. In relationships, money can be a touchy subject. When someone lends money, even if it's to a partner, it's still a loan. Asking for it to be forgiven after a while might come off as taking advantage, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand.\n\nThe author's argument is that since the debt is a small percentage (3%) of her winnings, it's reasonable. But from the girlfriend's perspective, she might see it as crossing a line. She might have lent it with the understanding that it would be repaid, and now he's asking her to take it back, which could feel like a betrayal. Plus, the way he approached it by bringing up all the sacrifices he's made could make her feel guilty or like he's keeping score, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the response from her was indeed harsh, but the author's approach might have contributed. Instead of just asking, he started justifying with numbers and comparing their financial sacrifices, which could come off as confrontational. Money discussions need to be handled carefully, and bringing up past sacrifices in the context of a new request might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's reaction was unkind, the author's request might have been a bit presumptuous. He asked for something that was given as a loan, not a gift, and then tried to justify it with a comparison that could seem like he's keeping track of favors. That could be why the girlfriend felt disrespected. The author might have been in the wrong by not respecting the initial agreement of the loan and by approaching the request in a way that focused on his own sacrifices rather than her feelings.\n"
