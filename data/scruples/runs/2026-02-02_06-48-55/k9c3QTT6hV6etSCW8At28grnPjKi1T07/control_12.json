Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about the author's girlfriend winning a large sum of money and them asking if she could forgive some debt. The debt was 3,000 euros that the girlfriend previously lent to the author to fix their car. The author has been making efforts to pay it back by cutting costs, even when it's hard. When the girlfriend wins 100,000 euros, the author asks if she can reduce or eliminate the debt, but she reacts angrily, calls them an asshole, and ignores them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author took on debt with the expectation to pay it back, and the girlfriend initially lent the money, so there was an agreement. The author is now in a situation where they've been sacrificing a lot to repay it, and when the opportunity arises (her winning money), they feel it's reasonable to ask for relief. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh and dismissive, which is a key point here. \n\nThe author didn't expect her to say yes, but felt it was worth asking. The girlfriend's response was disrespectful, laughing at them and saying they were joking. The phrase \"I'm just not somebody like you\" is a bit unclear, but maybe she's referring to their differing attitudes towards money. The author tried to explain their reasoning by showing the calculations (3k is 3% of her winnings), but the girlfriend was upset by this approach, possibly seeing it as transactional rather than emotional.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they had a debt they took on, and when a windfall happened, they asked if it could be forgiven. That's not inherently wrong, especially since they were upfront about their financial struggles. However, the way they might have framed the request could be seen as manipulative, especially bringing up the sacrifices they made. The girlfriend might feel that the author is treating the relationship as a balance sheet, which can be hurtful. \n\nBut the main issue here is the girlfriend's reaction. She agreed to lend the money initially, so the author was fulfilling their part by trying to repay it. When a situation arises where she can forgive the debt (without it affecting her significantly, since it's 3% of her winnings), the author's request is reasonable. Her response was disrespectful and unkind, which is a problem. The author's attempt to rationalize their request might have been a mistake if it came off as guilt-tripping, but the core of the request isn't wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the request was valid, and the girlfriend's reaction was the main issue here. The author's actions were about trying to maintain their part of the agreement and seeking some relief when an opportunity presented itself, which isn't unreasonable. The way they explained their reasoning might not have been the best, but the request itself isn't morally wrong.\n"
