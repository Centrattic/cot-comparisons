She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a step-parent who's taking care of their children, paying for everything, and the kids still see their biological mom as a hero. The author had a conversation with their daughter about the pageant question, where they expressed frustration about the mom being seen as an angel. The author is wondering if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The current step-parent is providing all the support, but the kids still idealize the biological mom. The author's response to the daughter was a bit harsh, pointing out the other parent's shortcomings. \n\nNow, the key points here are about communication with children. The author mentions they don't want to derogate the mother but are frustrated. The daughter is asking for advice on her hero question, and the author uses this opportunity to highlight their own role versus the ex's. \n\nI think the author's intention is to make the child appreciate their efforts. However, directly pointing out the mother's flaws in front of the child, even if not in a derogatory way, might be undermining the child's perspective. Kids often have a natural tendency to idealize their biological parents, especially when they're not living with them. The author might be projecting their own negative feelings onto the child's situation.\n\nThe author's approach could be seen as trying to shift the child's perception, which isn't fair. The children should be allowed to form their own opinions about both parents without being influenced negatively by the step-parent. Even if the author is frustrated, it's not the child's fault how they view their mother. The author is in a position of authority and should model healthy relationships, not badmouth the other parent, even indirectly.\n\nAlso, the author is providing for the children's needs, which is commendable, but that doesn't negate the child's right to maintain a relationship with their mother. The author's frustration is valid, but their method of expressing it in that conversation might have been inappropriate. They should focus on their own role as a supportive parent rather than trying to diminish the mother's image.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're discouraging the child from holding her mother in high regard, which isn't their place. Even if the mother has issues, the author shouldn't use the child as a medium to express those frustrations.\n"
