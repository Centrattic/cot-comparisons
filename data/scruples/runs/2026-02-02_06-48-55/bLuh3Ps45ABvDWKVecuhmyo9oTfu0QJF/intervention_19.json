She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his ex-wife's children since she was a \"perennial fuck up.\" He's providing for them financially and emotionally, and he's upset that his stepchildren still see their mother as a hero despite her issues.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's resentment and his response to his daughter's question about her hero. He was trying to explain the complexities of their mother's situation, pointing out the differences between visitation and full-time parenting. But did he overstep?\n\nFirst, the author mentions he's not derogatory towards the mother, which is a point in his favor. He doesn't want to hurt her, but he's frustrated. However, he did make a comparison that could be seen as undermining the mother's role. He highlighted the ease of being a parent for two weekends versus full-time, which might come across as belittling her attempts to be a good mother. Even if his intentions were to make the child aware of the situation, he might have inadvertently made the mother look bad in front of the child.\n\nChildren often idolize their parents, especially when the other parent isn't around as much. The author is trying to balance his own feelings of being unappreciated against the child's natural inclination to admire their biological mother. But by pointing out the mother's shortcomings, he's risking damaging the child's perception of her, even if he's trying not to. The line between educating the child and undermining the mother is thin here.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter is eight years old, her understanding of the situation might not be as nuanced. The author's response, while from a place of frustration, might not be the best way to handle it. It's possible he's right in his assessment of the mother's ability to care, but expressing it in that way could be harmful to the child's relationship with both parents.\n\nIn terms of the stepfather's role, it's important to foster a healthy relationship between the child and both parents, even if one parent isn't doing everything right. The stepfather's frustration is valid, but his approach here might not be the healthiest. He should consider other ways to address his feelings without involving the child in the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for his resentment, the way he expressed it was problematic. He's in the wrong because he's trying to influence the child's perception of the mother, which isn't his place. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
