She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a stepfather who's taking care of his stepchildren after their mom, the ex-wife, has a history of problematic behavior. The kids see their mom as a hero despite her issues, which is frustrating the stepfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather has taken on a lot, providing financial and emotional support, while the mother isn't contributing child support. He's trying to protect his wife and himself from resentment and is being direct when the daughter asks about who her hero should be. \n\nThe key points are: the stepfather's frustration is justified because he's doing a lot for the kids, yet they idolize a parent who hasn't been reliable. However, when he responds to his daughter's question, he's pointing out the reality without being disrespectful. He's not badmouthing the mother but explaining the differences in their living situations. \n\nBut wait, is it appropriate for him to bring up the mother's shortcomings in such a direct way? Even if he's not saying she's bad, he's contrasting his home with the mother's, which could make the daughter feel conflicted. However, he's also trying to help her understand the context, which might be necessary for her to form a balanced view. \n\nLegally, the mother isn't paying child support, which is a factor. Emotionally, the kids might be influenced by their time with her, even if it's less. The stepfather is trying to manage their perspective without being negative, which is tricky. \n\nThe question is whether his actions are wrong. If he's being honest without being malicious, perhaps it's not wrong. He's advocating for himself and his wife's efforts. But if he's trying to sway the kids' opinions, that could be problematic. However, in this case, he's answering a question factually, not forcing his views. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and the reality of their situations without attacking the mother. He's helping the daughter understand the context, which is important for her to have a realistic view.\n"
