She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The person is a stepfather who's asking if he's at fault for resenting that his kids see their mother (his ex-wife) as a hero. His ex had a lot of problems: jail, affairs, job issues, lives with her mom. He was a single dad for three years, took care of the kids, remarried, and now he and his wife provide everything for the kids. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. He's forgiven her but is frustrated that the kids idealize her.\n\nSo, he had a conversation with his daughter where she asked if she should say her mom is her hero. He explained that while their mom is part of the family, they provide for the kids and take care of their needs. He mentions that during visits, the mother doesn't have chores and uses food stamps, implying it's easier to be a parent part-time. He's trying not to hurt the kids' image of their mom but is frustrated they don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The ex is clearly not a good role model, but as a parent, children often have a positive view of their biological parents, especially if they're not around much. The stepfather might be feeling unappreciated and resentful because the kids don't see him as the hero they see their mom as. However, he's trying to manage the kids' perspective without being negative about the mother. He's not badmouthing her, which is good, but he's also trying to redirect the kids' understanding of what being a parent entails.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, children often maintain a positive image of their natural parents, especially when they're not the custodial parent. The stepfather's frustration is understandable, but his approach might be causing the kids to feel conflicted. He's trying to explain that being present and providing consistently is harder than part-time parenting. However, telling the daughter that her mother isn't the main caregiver might come across as undermining the mother's role, even if he's not directly badmouthing her.\n\nThe key points here are whether he overstepped in the conversation and if his resentment is justified. He didn't outright criticize the mother but pointed out the practicalities of full-time versus part-time parenting. This could be seen as trying to correct the child's perception, which might not be entirely fair to the child's emotional needs. The child might feel torn between two parents, even if one is more absent. The stepfather's role is to support the child while not devaluing the other parent, which he's trying to do, but his frustration might be clouding his judgment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's not in the wrong for feeling resentful, given the circumstances, but his approach in the conversation might be problematic. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expressing his feelings in that way. Since he wasn't directly negative about the mother but tried to highlight the differences in parental roles, it's a nuanced situation. However, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong because he's trying to foster a realistic understanding in the child, even if it's difficult.\n"
