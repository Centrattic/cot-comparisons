She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person, let's call them the author, is a single dad who has been raising three kids for three years after divorcing their ex-wife. The ex has a troubled history\u2014jail, affairs, job issues, and currently lives with her mom. The author remarried and now they and their new wife take care of the kids, providing healthcare, school help, activities, and even future plans like a car and braces. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. The author mentions forgiving the ex but feels resentful that the kids see their mom as a hero. \n\nThe key incident is when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out that the ex only sees the kids every other weekend and has it easier, while they and their stepmom do all the hard work. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze from different angles. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they aren't the custodial parent? Wait, the kids live with the author full-time. The ex has visitation rights every other weekend. So legally, the author has primary custody. \n\nEmotionally, the author is feeling unappreciated. They've taken on a lot, but the kids still have a positive image of their biological mom, which is common. Kids often have a complex relationship with their parents, especially if one parent is absent. The author's frustration is understandable, but their response to the daughter could be seen as trying to influence the child's perception of the ex. \n\nThe author doesn't want to badmouth the ex, which is good, but their comment might be trying to make the daughter question her admiration for the ex. It's possible that the daughter is just stating a fact about her mother, not necessarily being ungrateful to the stepmom and author. Maybe the daughter sees the ex as a hero for being her biological parent or other reasons. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they are trying to undermine the ex's image in front of the child. Even if they're not directly badmouthing, pointing out the ex's easier schedule and lack of responsibilities could be seen as subtly criticizing her. The daughter is young and might not realize that her mom's role is different. The author's frustration is valid, but their approach might be inappropriate. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because they are trying to make the child aware of the realities of their situation. They are providing for the kids, and it's reasonable to feel that they deserve recognition. However, the line is thin here. The author's response could be seen as manipulating the child's opinion, which is not healthy for the child's relationships with both parents.\n\nIn family dynamics, it's generally advised to maintain a positive image of the other parent unless there are serious issues. The author doesn't mention any current harm from the ex's actions, just past issues. The daughter's admiration of the ex isn't based on current actions but maybe on the bond they have during visits. The author's comment might be a way to express their own feelings but could harm the daughter's relationship with the ex. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they're trying to influence the child's perception of the ex, even if indirectly. It's important to validate the author's feelings of resentment but also recognize that undermining the other parent can be harmful. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be sure. Alternatively, if the author is justified in feeling unappreciated, maybe B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut the key point is whether the author's response was wrong. The author didn't directly attack the ex but pointed out the differences in parental roles. This could be seen as guiding the child's choice for the pageant, which is inappropriate. Parents should support each other and avoid such situations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
