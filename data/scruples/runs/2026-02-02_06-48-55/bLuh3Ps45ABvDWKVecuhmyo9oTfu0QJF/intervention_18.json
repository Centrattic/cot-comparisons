She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed scenario where the author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his stepchildren, while the biological mother has a troubled history. The author is frustrated because the kids still see their mom as a hero. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a stepfather who's doing a lot for the kids\u2014providing healthcare, activities, financial support, etc. He's not asking for child support because the mother can't support herself. He's even forgiven her. But he's upset when the daughter wants to name her mother as her hero in a pageant. The author's response to the daughter was to remind her of the support they provide and that being a parent part-time is easier.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate that. The author didn't call the mother names or badmouth her. He tried to explain the situation to his daughter, pointing out that the mother's role is part-time and the stepfamily's role is full-time. The daughter is only 8 years old, so maybe the author's response is a bit harsh, but is it wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help his daughter understand the reality of the situation, which could help her form a balanced view of both parents. On the other hand, pressuring an 8-year-old to choose a hero might not be fair, especially considering the child's emotional state. The author might be projecting his own frustrations onto the child, even if he's trying to do it respectfully.\n\nBut the author didn't attack the ex-wife directly. He's trying to guide the daughter's thinking without badmouthing the mother. The question is whether it's wrong to express his frustration in that way. It's a delicate situation because the child is being pulled between two parents. The author might be in the wrong if he's influencing the child's opinion too much, but since he's not overtly negative, maybe he's just being honest about the circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, the author is trying to make the daughter aware that the stepfamily's efforts should be recognized. However, children often idealize their biological parents, so the author might need to accept that. The key is whether his response was respectful and whether he overstepped. He didn't insult the mother, but he did highlight the mother's shortcomings indirectly. That could be seen as undermining the mother, even subtly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if his intention was to help the daughter think critically about her answer. However, maybe he should have let the child decide without the comparison. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But given that the author isn't being harsh or abusive, just expressing his feelings and the reality of the situation, it's a tricky call. I think he's not in the wrong because he's being honest and trying to protect his own role without being negative towards the mother.\n"
