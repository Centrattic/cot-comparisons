She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who posted the situation is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent has been a single dad for three years, took care of the kids full-time, learned skills like braiding hair, remarried, and now the stepmom and he provide everything for the children. The ex is described as having multiple issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mother. The parent isn't asking for child support because the ex can't support herself and they've forgiven her.\n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The parent responds by pointing out the stepmom and he provide for the kids, while the ex only sees them every other weekend and doesn't require chores, using food stamps. The parent is frustrated that the kids see the ex as a hero despite the stepmom's and his sacrifices.\n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The parent's response was direct but didn't derogate the ex. They explained the situation to the daughter, highlighting their own contributions versus the ex's limited role. This seems reasonable because the parent wants the daughter to understand the context without necessarily belittling the ex.\n\n2. The parent's intention is to help the daughter realize the reality of their situations without damaging her image of the ex. The frustration comes from the children not appreciating their stepmom and themselves despite their efforts. The parent isn't trying to manipulate the daughter's choice but is providing information to help her decide.\n\n3. The parent is not the one in direct conflict with the kids; they are the caregivers. The ex's actions (affairs, jail) have led to the current custody arrangement. The parent is addressing their own feelings of resentment, which is valid but needs to be managed.\n\nHowever, the parent is the one who is primarily responsible for the children's upbringing now. The stepmom is part of their current family structure. The parent's frustration is about the children not recognizing their efforts. The response to the daughter is educational rather than malicious. They didn't force the daughter to choose but explained their perspective. The parent is also respectful of the ex, not wanting to damage the daughter's image of her, which shows they are trying to balance their feelings with the daughter's relationship with her mom.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent is expressing valid emotions about their sacrifices and the children not acknowledging them. However, the parent's approach could be seen as trying to influence the daughter's perception of her mother, even if subtly. But since they're not directly attacking the ex and are explaining their own role, it's more about clarifying their contributions rather than being in the wrong. The parent's actions are within their rights to express their feelings, especially since they are the primary caregivers. The ex's actions have led to the current situation, so the parent's frustration is somewhat justified given their efforts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the parent is not in the wrong) because they are addressing their feelings in a respectful manner without attacking the ex, and their contributions are valid.\n"
