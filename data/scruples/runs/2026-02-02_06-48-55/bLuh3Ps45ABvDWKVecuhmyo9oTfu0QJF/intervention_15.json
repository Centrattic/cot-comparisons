She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mom as a hero, given the complicated family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author is a stepdad who's been providing a lot for the kids\u2014paying for healthcare, activities, even a car for the son. The ex has a history of issues, like jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author is frustrated that the kids idolize their mom despite her shortcomings, especially since they live with him full-time and he's doing all the work.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's frustration leading him to question the kids' hero choice. He tried to explain the differences between being a parent part-time versus full-time. Did he overstep? The key points are: he didn't badmouth the ex directly, but he did imply that the ex's parenting is easier because she's not around as much. That could make the kids feel conflicted or guilty about their feelings towards their mother.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't outright criticize the ex. He just highlighted the reality of their living situations. He also mentions he's forgiven her, which shows he's not trying to harm her image. However, the way he framed the conversation might have been a bit underhanded by pointing out that the kids get to go to their mom's every other weekend with no chores and food stamps. That could be seen as subtly putting down the mom's parenting, even if he didn't say it directly. \n\nThe daughter is preparing for a pageant question, so she's probably trying to please both parents. The author's response might make her feel like she's supposed to choose between them, which isn't healthy. The frustration is valid, but the approach could be problematic. It's possible that the author's intention was to make the kids appreciate their current situation, but he might have undermined the ex without realizing it. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions have consequences, and the author is doing his best to provide for the kids. The question is whether his frustration is justified and if his method of addressing it was wrong. Since he didn't directly denigrate the mom but pointed out the practical differences in their living arrangements, it's a gray area. But the fact that he's the one providing all the resources and the kids still idolize the mom could lead to resentment. However, the way he handled the conversation might have been a mistake, even if his intentions were good. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions could harm the kids' relationship with their mom, even if he didn't intend to. Alternatively, if the ex's behavior is indeed problematic, then the author isn't entirely at fault. Hmm. It's tricky. The key is whether his actions were appropriate. By pointing out the mom's shortcomings indirectly, he's influencing the kids' perception, which might not be right. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
