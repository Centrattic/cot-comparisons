She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his three children full-time after being a single dad for three years. He's now remarried, and he and his wife provide everything for the kids\u2014healthcare, school stuff, activities, even paying for their mom's car and braces even though the mom can't support herself. He doesn't ask for child support, which is a key point here.\n\nNow, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they take care of the kids full-time and that while the mother visits every other weekend, it's easier to be a parent part-time. He's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero and don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, legally, if he's not receiving child support, that's his choice, but maybe the ex should be contributing. However, the author claims she can't support herself, and he's forgiven her. So maybe that part is okay. But when he talks to the daughter about choosing her mom as a hero, he's essentially undermining the mother in front of the child. Even though he's not directly derogatory, he's comparing the two parents, suggesting that his role is harder. \n\nChildren often have complex feelings about parents, especially when they're split between two households. The stepfather is trying to assert that their current living situation and support is more substantial. But is it right to make the child question their mother's role? The mother might have her flaws, but the child still loves her. The stepfather's intention is to make the kids appreciate his efforts, but by implying their mother isn't doing her part, he might be damaging their relationship. \n\nAlso, the mother sees them every other weekend and doesn't give them chores, which could be positive from the child's perspective\u2014maybe more relaxed and fun. The stepfather is trying to highlight the difficulty of being a full-time parent, but the child might not equate that to being a better parent. \n\nThere's a difference between being a present, loving parent and being a hero. The stepfather is doing a lot, but the daughter's view of her mom as a hero could be due to idealization or the mother's efforts during her time, even if they're not consistent. The stepfather might be projecting his own negative feelings onto the child's perspective, which isn't fair. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's being dismissive of the child's feelings about the mother and is trying to belittle the mother's role, even if indirectly. It's important for the child to have a positive relationship with both parents, and the stepfather's approach could be harmful.\n"
