She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's a single parent, now remarried, supporting his children. He's upset that his kids still see their ex-mother as a hero despite her history of issues like jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. He doesn't take child support and forgives her, but he's frustrated when his daughter asks if she should say her birth mom is her hero for a pageant.\n\nHe responded by pointing out the contrast between the stepmom and him providing for the kids full-time versus the ex's inconsistent support. The key here is whether his response was inappropriate. The user wants to know if he's wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, consider the father's actions. He's providing for the kids, covering all expenses, and has a supportive stepmom. He's not cutting off contact but is frustrated with the kids' perception. His response to his daughter was direct but not derogatory, just trying to explain the practical aspects of full-time parenting. The ex-mother isn't a good parent, but he's not badmouthing her. The question is if his frustration is justified.\n\nCommon AITA threads often show that it's hard to be in the right when you're trying to correct a child's view of a parent, even if that parent isn't ideal. However, the father's response was to help his daughter think critically about her answer, not to disparage the mother. Since he's not attacking her directly but pointing out realities, some might argue he's justified. On the flip side, if the kids are still with the ex every other weekend, they have that time to form opinions. The father's frustration is valid, but maybe overstepping by influencing their choice of a hero.\n\nBut in AITA scenarios, the key is often about fairness. If he's not saying negative things about the ex but just highlighting his and the stepmom's role, maybe he's not in the wrong. The daughter's question might stem from positive experiences with the ex, even if short. The father's response is a teaching moment, not a malicious attack. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
