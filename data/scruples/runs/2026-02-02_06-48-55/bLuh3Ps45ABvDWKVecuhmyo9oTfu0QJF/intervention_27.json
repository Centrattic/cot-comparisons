She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author, a stepfather, is upset that his children still see their mother, who he describes as having a troubled history, as a hero. He's providing for the kids financially and emotionally, but feels they don't appreciate him and their stepmother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's ex-wife has a history of issues like jail time, affairs, and instability. He's taken on the role of a single father for three years, remarried, and is now supporting the kids. However, when his daughter asks about naming her mother as a hero for a pageant, he responds by pointing out the mother's lack of responsibility and the support they provide. He doesn't want to hurt the ex, but he's frustrated that the kids idealize her despite her shortcomings.\n\nThe key points here are the children's perception of their mother and the stepfather's influence on that. The author is a stepfather, not their biological parent. He's trying to assert his role and the effort they've put into their lives. But he's also criticizing the mother in front of the children, even if indirectly. The question is whether his approach is appropriate.\n\nI should think about how children process this. Even if the ex is problematic, the children might still have a positive view of their biological mother, which is natural. The stepfather's frustration is valid, but how he addressed it might be problematic. By framing the mother's care as easier because it's only two weekends a month, he's comparing his role to hers, which could undermine the kids' appreciation for the father and stepmother's efforts.\n\nBut the author claims he didn't derogate the mother; he just tried to explain the situation. However, his response might be making the kids feel conflicted or guilty about their feelings towards their mother. It's possible that he's overstepping as a stepfather by trying to influence their perception of their biological parent, even if the ex isn't a good role model. The kids might need to form their own opinions rather than being guided by the stepfather's criticisms.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepfather is providing for the children's needs and wants them to recognize that. But it's a delicate balance. The children's relationship with their mother is their own, and while the stepfather isn't obligated to support her, he might be in the wrong if he's trying to sway the children's views. The TOS (Terms of Service) for AITA usually consider intent. The author's intent is to correct their perception, not necessarily to be mean, but the effect could be harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite his good intentions, he's interfering in the children's relationship with their mother, which can lead to long-term emotional issues. Step-parents have a challenging role, but it's important to avoid undermining the biological parent, even if they're flawed. The children need to develop their own relationship with both parents without external pressure.\n"
