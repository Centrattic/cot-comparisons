She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepfather who's upset that his children idolize their mother despite her history of issues. He's taken care of the kids financially and emotionally, his ex is described as having multiple problems, and he's not asking for child support. The key moment is when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her mother as her hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that their current family provides for them more than the mother does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The stepfather is a stepmom, and he's trying to balance between not putting down the mother but also making the kids aware of the reality. The mother is absent and has a problematic history. The children see her as a hero, which the stepfather feels is unfair given her actions. \n\nIs it wrong for him to express that frustration? Well, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The stepfather didn't directly attack the mother, but he's highlighting the contrast between what the current family does and the mother's limited role. He's not making the kids hate their mother, but he's trying to get them to see the reality. \n\nIn co-parenting situations, especially with a difficult ex, it's important not to badmouth the other parent. But the stepfather isn't doing that; he's just pointing out the practical support they provide. The mother's actions (jail, affairs, etc.) are part of the children's knowledge, but maybe not the full context. The stepfather is trying to help the daughter understand that being a parent isn't just about the time spent, but the consistent support. \n\nIs the stepfather justified in his frustration? He's providing a lot, but the children still look up to their mother. It's possible that the mother, even with her flaws, is present during visits and might be more nurturing in those times, even if it's less consistently. The stepfather's comment might be valid in that it's hard to be a parent full-time, but the way he said it could be seen as undermining the mother's role. However, he didn't directly tell the daughter not to say her mother, just pointed out the contrast. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's trying to make the children aware of the reality without directly attacking the mother, maybe not. But if he's being overly critical or trying to shift their perception, that could be problematic. The line between encouraging the kids to see the truth and undermining the other parent is thin. The stepfather's approach might be reasonable given the mother's history, but he should avoid making the kids feel their affection for their mother is misplaced. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural views on co-parenting. In some perspectives, children should be allowed to have their own opinions about their parents, even if those opinions are influenced by the other parent's behavior. The stepfather's input is valid in terms of their support, but he might not have the right to dictate who the children should admire. However, he's not forcing them; he's just explaining his point of view. \n\nSo, considering all this, the stepfather isn't in the wrong. He's addressing his feelings of being unappreciated and trying to set realistic expectations, without attacking the mother directly. The answer would be B (No).\n"
