She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a stepfather who's providing a lot for his children but feels resentful when they idolize their mother, who has a history of bad behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex-wife has a problematic history: jail time, affairs, job instability, and living with her mom. The stepfather and his new wife are taking care of the kids financially and emotionally. The daughter is preparing for a pageant and when asked about her hero, the daughter considers her mom. The stepfather responds by pointing out that the mother only sees the kids part-time and the stepfamily provides everything.\n\nThe main question is whether the stepfather's reaction is wrong. On one hand, he's clearly frustrated and trying to make the kids aware of their mom's situation. On the other hand, he's trying not to badmouth her. The problem is, by highlighting the mother's shortcomings, even indirectly, he might be influencing the kids' perception. But does that make him in the wrong?\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to avoid putting kids in the middle of a custody battle or making them choose sides. The stepfather's approach might be seen as trying to correct the daughter's perception, but doing so could be harmful. However, he's also not directly putting down their mom, just pointing out the practical realities. \n\nThe stepfather is being honest about the effort they put into the kids' lives. But maybe he should address his feelings of resentment privately, rather than using the child as a medium. The daughter is eight, so she might not fully grasp the nuances of her parent's situation. It's possible that the stepfather is projecting his own frustrations rather than addressing the child's genuine admiration for her mother. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to express frustration in this way? Some might say yes, because the child is caught in the middle. Others might argue that it's reasonable to explain the situation so the child understands the context. The stepfather isn't badmouthing the mother, just stating facts. However, it's still a sensitive approach. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the stepfather is crossing a line by implying that the mother is a bad parent. If he's just being honest without being malicious, maybe not. But if he's trying to undermine the mother's image, even subtly, then he might be wrong. Since the user says he's forgiven her and doesn't want to hurt her, maybe his intentions are good. But the method might still be questionable. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), because he's trying to be honest without being derogatory. However, there's a fine line here. But given the context, he's not outright badmouthing, just explaining the situation. So the answer might be B.\n"
