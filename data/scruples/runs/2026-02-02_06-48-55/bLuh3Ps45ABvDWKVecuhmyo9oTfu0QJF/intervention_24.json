She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is a stepdad who's been taking care of his stepchildren since their mom was a single parent but now is a stepdad. The ex-wife, the kids' biological mom, has a history of problems\u2014jail, affairs, losing jobs, living with her mom. The stepdad and his wife provide everything for the kids, including healthcare, school activities, even buying a car for the son. He doesn't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself.\n\nNow, the daughter is going to a pageant and asked if she should say her mom is her hero. The stepdad responds by pointing out that they provide for the kids, they live with them, take care of them, and that their mom only sees them every other weekend with no chores. He's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero and don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the stepdad's actions: He's not denouncing the mom, but he's pointing out the reality of the situation. He's explaining the difference between the two households. The mom can't support herself, the kids have more time with the stepdad, and he's highlighting that. The stepdad's frustration is about the kids not recognizing his and his wife's efforts. \n\nBut is it wrong to express that frustration? Well, when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero, the stepdad's response is to contrast the two living situations. He's not directly criticizing the mom in front of the kids, but he's drawing a comparison. He's trying to get the daughter to consider the reality of the time and effort they put in versus the mom's role.\n\nHowever, maybe the stepdad's approach is problematic because he's influencing the daughter's choice in a way that might undermine the mother's relationship with the kids. Even though the mom has issues, the stepdad's comment could be seen as manipulating the daughter's perception. The daughter might feel conflicted about choosing her biological mother as a hero if the stepdad points out the differences in parenting styles and financial support.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepdad is being honest about the situation. The mom isn't providing the same level of care or financial support. The stepdad is trying to help the daughter understand where the support is coming from. The stepdad isn't outright badmouthing the mom, just stating facts. But he is trying to guide the daughter's answer, which might not be appropriate. The daughter might feel pressured to choose based on who is providing more, rather than her genuine feelings.\n\nThe key here is whether the stepdad's response was a fair way to address the daughter's question. By contrasting the two households, he's potentially invalidating the mother's role, even if she isn't as supportive. The daughter might have a natural affection for her mom, even if the mom isn't providing the same level of resources. The stepdad's frustration is understandable, but using the opportunity to highlight the differences might be a way of undermining the mother in front of the child, even if indirectly.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter's perspective, she's in a pageant and wants to give an answer that's acceptable. The stepdad's response might make her feel like she's supposed to choose based on who provides more resources, which isn't necessarily the reason someone would be a hero. Heroes are usually people you admire for their character, not just who gives you things. The stepdad's focus on material support might be missing the point of what a hero is.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the stepdad is in a position where he needs to respect the mother's relationship with the children, even if he disagrees with her actions. By steering the conversation towards the differences in their living situations, he might be overstepping his role. He's not forbidding the daughter from choosing her mom, but he's making her aware of the other side, which could be seen as trying to sway her opinion.\n\nSo, balancing all this, it's possible that the stepdad is in the wrong because he's using the situation to compare the two different parenting roles, which could be seen as undermining the mother and not respecting the daughter's autonomy in choosing her hero. Even if his intentions are to highlight the support they provide, the method might be inappropriate and could hurt the daughter's relationship with both parents.\n"
