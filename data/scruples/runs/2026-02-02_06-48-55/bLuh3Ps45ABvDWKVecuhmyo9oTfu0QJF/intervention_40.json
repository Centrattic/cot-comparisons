She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children since their mother, his ex-wife, is considered problematic. The kids still see their mother as a hero, and the author is frustrated because he and his wife provide everything for the kids. He had a conversation with his daughter where he expressed his feelings about their mother not being the ideal parent, but he also says he doesn't want to badmouth her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is doing a lot for the kids, providing financially and emotionally. The mother has a history of issues, but the kids have limited time with her. The author's frustration is understandable, but how did he express it? He didn't directly criticize the mother, but he did point out the reality of her situation compared to their current living arrangement. The daughter is trying to decide who to name as her hero, and the author's response was to highlight the differences in parenting roles.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's approach was appropriate. He didn't tell the daughter what to say but made a point about the mother's role versus their own. The author claims he doesn't want to hurt the mother but is frustrated by the kids' perceptions. Is it wrong for him to express his feelings in a way that might subtly influence the kids' view? On one hand, the kids have a right to their own opinions about their mother. On the other hand, the author is trying to make his own contributions acknowledged.\n\nI think the author's intention wasn't to put down the ex-wife but to make his daughter aware of the realities. However, by pointing out that the mother doesn't do chores and has food stamps, he might be indirectly influencing the daughter's perception. Even though he's not directly criticizing the mother, the message is that the stepmother and he are the real parents. That could be seen as undermining the mother's role in the daughter's eyes, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut the author also mentions he's forgiven the mother and doesn't want to hurt her. So maybe he's trying to balance his feelings. The daughter's hero question is a trigger for the author's resentment. The answer might depend on whether the author's response was appropriate given the context. Since he's the one providing care and the mother isn't, maybe he's justified in explaining the differences. However, the fact that the kids still admire the mother despite her issues could be a sign that the author's efforts to show his own role aren't being recognized, which is valid.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? The author didn't attack the mother directly, but his comments might have been a subtle way of highlighting her shortcomings. The daughter is trying to navigate who to admire, and the author's input might be influencing her decision, even if it's not overtly negative. It's a gray area. The author's frustration is real, but the way he addressed it could be seen as trying to correct the daughter's admiration, which might not be fair to the mother. So, depending on the approach, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's using the daughter's pageant question as a way to express his dissatisfaction, which could affect the daughter's perception of her mother.\n"
