She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for resenting that their kids see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex-wife has a troubled history with jail, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author was a single dad for three years, learned to braid hair for his daughter, remarried, and now provides everything for the kids. They pay for healthcare, school activities, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. They don't ask for child support since the ex can't support herself and have forgiven her.\n\nThe issue came up when the daughter was preparing for a pageant and considered naming her mom as a hero. The author questioned her about this, pointing out that they provide for her daily, while the mom only sees the kids two weekends a month with no chores, using food stamps. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is frustrated that the kids see her as an angel and not appreciate their stepmom and him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the dynamics. The author is trying to guide the daughter to be honest about her living situations, pointing out the practical support they provide versus the ex's more limited role. It's about helping the daughter understand the reality of her parents' roles. However, the author is doing this in a way that might be making the daughter choose sides. There's a conflict between the stepmom's efforts and the ex's history. The author's frustration is understandable, but should they influence the daughter's perception of her mother?\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong since they're not forcing the daughter's choice. Emotionally, the author is trying to balance fairness and their own feelings. However, the daughter might be caught in the middle, which isn't ideal. The key is whether the author is being disrespectful or manipulative. The author says they don't derogate the mother, just point out facts. But by highlighting the mother's limitations and their own sacrifices, they might be subtly undermining the mother's image in the daughter's eyes, even if not directly. The daughter is allowed to choose her hero, and it's possible she values the time and freedom with her mom despite her issues. The author's response could be seen as steering the daughter's perspective, which might not be in the child's best interest. So, is the author wrong? It's a nuanced situation. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to be honest with their child about their situation, but there's a line about not causing the child to feel divided. However, since the author isn't being overtly negative and is providing context, maybe it's not their fault. But some might argue that they shouldn't compare the two mothers in that way. Hmm.\n"
