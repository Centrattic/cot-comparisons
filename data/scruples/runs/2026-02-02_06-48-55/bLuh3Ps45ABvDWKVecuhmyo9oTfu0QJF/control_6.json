She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who's upset that his children see their mother as a hero despite her problematic behavior, and he's frustrated because his stepmother and he provide for them. He got upset when his daughter considered naming her mother as her hero and explained why their mother's parenting is easier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The stepmom and the dad are the ones handling most of the parenting, financial responsibilities, and daily care. The daughter is asking about choosing her mother as a hero, and the dad responds by pointing out the reality of the mother's limited involvement and the stepmom's contributions.\n\nThe key points here are whether the father's reaction is justified. The father is trying to balance not putting down the mother (he mentions he's forgiven her) while also wanting his children to recognize their stepmom's efforts. His response to the daughter seems to be explaining the practical aspects of parenting and how their stepmom is the one providing consistently. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, they might still look up to their birth mother despite the circumstances, especially if they see her as the \"real\" mom, even if she isn't involved as much. The father's frustration is understandable because he's taking on the bulk of the parenting load. However, the way he expressed his feelings might come across as comparing the two mothers, which could be confusing for the child. \n\nBut according to the situation, he didn't directly put down the mother; he focused on the practical aspects of parenting. He's also being honest about the stepmom's role. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to guide his daughter to recognize the stepmom's contributions without badmouthing the mother, that's a valid approach. However, if he's making the daughter feel guilty for considering her mother as a hero, that's a problem. But based on the description, he's explaining the reality rather than criticizing the mother personally. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether his approach is appropriate. Since he's not belittling the mother but explaining the effort involved in full-time parenting, it's more about the daughter understanding the context. However, he's also trying to manage the daughter's perception, which is a bit of a balancing act. \n\nIn terms of child psychology, it's important for children to maintain a positive relationship with both parents, even if one is not a good role model. The father might be trying to protect the daughter from potential heartbreak later if the mother's behavior changes. But the father's right to feel frustrated is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the father is not in the wrong because he's addressing the daughter's question honestly while highlighting the stepmom's contributions. He's not attacking the mother but explaining the reality. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
