She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. Let's break down the details. The person is a guy who was in a marriage that ended, and his ex-wife has a lot of issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and now living with her mom. He was a single dad for three years, taking care of their three kids, even learning to braid hair for his daughter. He's since remarried, and his new wife is helping out a lot. They take care of the kids' needs\u2014healthcare, school work, activities, and even big expenses like a car for his son and braces for his daughter. He doesn't ask for child support because his ex can't support herself, and he's forgiven her.\n\nThe issue comes up when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The guy responds by pointing out that the kids live with him and his wife, who provide everything, while the ex only has them two weekends a month with no chores and uses food stamps. He's frustrated that the kids see their mother as an angel and don't appreciate what he and his stepmom do.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my take. Let's consider the key points here.\n\nFirst, the ex is clearly having a lot of problems. From the description, she's not in a stable position to care for the kids, and the author has taken over custody. He's providing for the kids, which is a significant responsibility. However, the problem arises in how he's addressing the kids' perception of their mother. He's trying to make them realize that their stepmom and he are the ones providing, but he's not directly attacking the ex. He's just pointing out the differences in the lifestyles and the responsibilities each parent has. \n\nBut is this the right approach? The daughter is asking for advice on who to name as her hero. The author's response might be seen as undermining the mother's role, even if he's not derogatory. Kids need to maintain a relationship with both parents, even if one isn't as present. The author might be projecting his own resentment onto the kids, making them choose sides. Even though he's not being cruel, the underlying message is that their mother isn't contributing as much, which could affect the kids' feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in feeling frustrated because he's the one providing all the resources. But the way he's handling the situation might be inappropriate. He's essentially trying to influence the kids' perception of their mother, which isn't his role. The ex is still their mother, and the kids have a right to have a relationship with her unless there's abuse or neglect. Since the author is the custodial parent, he's responsible for the kids' well-being, but he should also encourage a healthy relationship with the non-custodial parent unless it's harmful. \n\nSo, even if the ex is problematic, the author's response might be seen as undermining her in front of the kids. The key here is whether the author is respecting the kids' relationship with their mother or trying to manipulate their views. The fact that he's trying to make them see the difference in parenting roles could lead to the kids feeling conflicted or torn between parents. The author might be in the wrong because he's not allowing the kids to have their own opinions about their mother without his influence. Even though he's not being harsh, his comments could be damaging to the kids' perception of their mother, which isn't their place to dictate unless the mother is abusive. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's interfering with the kids' relationship with their mother and not respecting their autonomy in choosing their hero, instead inserting his own grievances into their decision.\n"
