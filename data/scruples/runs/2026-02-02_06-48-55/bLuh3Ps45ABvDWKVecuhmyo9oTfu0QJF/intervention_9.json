She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being resentful that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex has a troubled history\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The AITA has stepped up as a single dad, remarried, and provides everything for the kids. He's not asking for child support because the ex can't support herself. The conflict comes when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her mother as a hero. The father responds with frustration, pointing out all they do for the kids.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's resentment is justified. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to assess both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: he's providing for the kids, not holding the ex accountable for child support, and trying to be fair. He's not badmouthing the ex. However, when his daughter asks about her mother being a hero, he brings up the contrast between the ex's limited involvement and his own. This might make the daughter feel conflicted or pressured. \n\nFrom the daughter's perspective, she's trying to answer a question for a pageant. She might have a positive relationship with her mom during visits, even if it's not the same as her stepmom and father. The father's response could come off as dismissive of her feelings or the positive aspects she sees in her mom. Even though the father is frustrated, he might be projecting his resentment onto his daughter's choice. \n\nThe key here is whether the father crossed a line. He didn't directly tell the daughter not to say her mom, but he highlighted the differences in their living situations. The father's frustration is understandable, but the way he addressed it might not be. He might be trying to make the daughter appreciate his efforts, but it could be seen as undermining her mother's role, even if indirectly. \n\nThe ex is not present in their daily lives, so the daughter might idealize her for not being involved in the responsibilities. The father's response might be an overreaction because he's trying to validate his own efforts while the daughter is navigating her feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's resentment is a natural emotion given the circumstances, but how he expressed it might not be appropriate. He didn't\u8fb1\u9a82 or insult the ex, but he did highlight her shortcomings in front of the daughter. The daughter might feel caught in the middle. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the father had simply said, \"You can choose whoever you feel is your hero,\" without bringing up the comparison, that would be better. But by contrasting the two, he might be influencing her choice. However, he's also trying to protect his daughter from false perceptions. \n\nIn the end, the father's intention isn't malicious\u2014he's trying to be fair and has a valid reason to feel frustrated. However, the way he handled the situation could be seen as wrong because it's imposing his views on his daughter's personal feelings. The answer might depend on cultural or situational factors, but generally, the father's approach might be considered in the wrong because he's not allowing the daughter to form her own opinion freely.\n"
