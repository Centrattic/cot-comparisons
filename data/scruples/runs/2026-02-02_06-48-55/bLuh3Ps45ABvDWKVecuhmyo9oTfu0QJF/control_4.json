She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mom as a hero. The situation is that the ex-wife has a lot of issues\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The current stepmom and the dad are providing for the kids, paying for everything, and they don't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself. Now, the daughter is entering a pageant and was asked who her hero is. The daughter considered saying her mom, so the dad responded to her questioning the choice, pointing out that they provide for her and that the mom only sees the kids every other weekend with easier parenting.\n\nSo, the key question is: is the dad in the wrong for feeling resentful and expressing that to his daughter? The dad says he hasn't derogated the mom but is frustrated the kids don't appreciate what they do. \n\nFirst, the dad is a single parent who's worked hard, remarried, and provided for the kids. He's done a lot, so his frustration might be understandable. However, when he talked to his daughter, he brought up the mother's lack of support and the other parent's easier schedule. Even though he didn't directly insult the mom, he's contrasting his stepmom's and his own sacrifices against the mother's. That could make the daughter feel pressured to not consider her mom as a hero, which might be unfair. The daughter is trying to make her own choice, and the dad's response could be seen as undermining the mother's role in the daughter's eyes. \n\nAlso, the dad is the one providing financially and taking care of the kids daily, but the children still have a relationship with their mom. Even if the mom isn't perfect, the children might admire her for other reasons. The dad's resentment could affect the kids' perception of their mom, even if indirectly. The dad's intention wasn't to hurt, but his actions might still be influencing the kids' views. \n\nIs it wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the dad has a right to feel unappreciated. On the other, he's possibly manipulating the situation to make the daughter question her admiration for her mom. The line is thin here. The dad's approach might not be the best way to handle his feelings and could damage the kids' relationships with their mother. So, maybe the answer is A, the dad is in the wrong for how he addressed his resentment, even if the feelings themselves are understandable.\n"
