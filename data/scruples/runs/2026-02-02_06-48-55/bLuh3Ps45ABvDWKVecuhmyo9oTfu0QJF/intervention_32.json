She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for resenting their kids seeing their ex as a hero. The ex has a troubled history with jail, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author is a single dad who took care of three kids for three years, remarried, and now provides everything for them. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. \n\nThe issue arises when their daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that the kids live with them full-time, have chores, attend activities, and that the ex visits every other weekend with no chores and uses food stamps. The author is frustrated because they feel the kids don't appreciate their efforts and still see the ex as an angel.\n\nNow, the key points here are the ex's behavior versus the author's actions. The ex's history is problematic, but the author is now in a stable situation with a new wife. The author's response to the daughter might be seen as trying to undermine the ex's image in front of the kids, even if they claim not to derogate her. The author is expressing frustration but is this right?\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to avoid badmouthing an ex in front of children, even if the ex has done wrong. The author might be projecting their own resentment onto the children, making them feel conflicted. The kids are caught between two parents, and the author's reaction could damage their relationship with the ex, even if the ex isn't a good role model. However, the ex's actions are indeed problematic, but the author's approach might not be the healthiest way to address this.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but the way they handled the situation might not be appropriate. They should perhaps guide the daughter to think critically about what a hero is, rather than directly comparing the parents. So, while the ex's actions are questionable, the author's method of addressing the daughter's question is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
