She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children since their mother, his ex-wife, left. The ex is described as having a problematic history: jail time, affairs, job issues, and living with her mom. The author and his new wife have been providing for the kids\u2014healthcare, activities, school help, even a car for the son. They refuse to take child support because the mother can't support herself. The author feels resentful that the kids see their mother as a hero despite her flaws. In a recent conversation about a pageant, the daughter asks if she should choose her mother as her hero. The author responds by pointing out the stepfamily's efforts and the easier time the mother has during limited visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Hmm. Let me break this down. The author's actions seem driven by frustration. He's not directly criticizing the mother but is highlighting the contrast between the stepfamily's support and the mother's lack of it. The key question is whether his response to the daughter was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the author didn't denigrate the mother, which is a point in his favor. He's trying to make the daughter aware of the realities without badmouthing her mom. However, using a child's question about a hero to subtly undermine the mother's image might be problematic. The daughter is in a position where she has to choose, and the father's response could be seen as manipulative. He's not just explaining his side but is making the daughter question her mother's role, which might be unfair. The daughter is eight, and her ability to understand the complexities of her parents' situation might be limited. The father's approach could breed resentment or confusion in the child, making her feel conflicted about her choices.\n\nAlso, the author's resentment is understandable given the ex-wife's behavior, but projecting that onto the child's perception might not be healthy. The focus should be on the child's best interests rather than the father's frustrations. The stepfamily's contributions are significant, but the way the father is addressing the daughter's question might not be the right approach. He should perhaps model gratitude and respect for the mother while affirming his own family's support, rather than pointing out the differences in effort. So, while the author's intentions are to protect the child from an idealized view of the mother, the method used could be harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his response could damage the child's trust and perception of both parents.\n"
