She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) who is a stepfather and stepmother to three children. The ex-wife, their biological mother, has a problematic history\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The author and their new wife have been the primary caregivers for the kids, providing everything from healthcare to activities, and even buying a car for the son. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. However, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out the stepfamily's efforts versus the biological mom's limited involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is trying to highlight the imbalance in the kids' perception of their mothers. The ex is a biological parent, and kids might naturally look up to her despite her flaws. The author feels resentful that their stepfamily's efforts aren't recognized, but they don't want to tarnish the kids' view of their mom. However, the author's response to the daughter seems to be trying to influence her answer to the pageant question, which might come off as manipulative or undermining the biological mother even if the author isn't directly badmouthing her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider co-parenting dynamics and the children's well-being. The ex might have limited involvement due to her circumstances, but she's still the biological mother, and the kids might have a bond with her. The author and stepmom providing for the kids is commendable, but the way the author addresses the daughter's question might be problematic. The author didn't directly criticize the mother but pointed out the differences in parenting roles, which could influence the daughter's perception. The daughter is trying to navigate her own feelings and might be conflicted. The author's frustration is understandable, but they need to balance their feelings without alienating the kids or the ex. \n\nThe key here is whether the author crossed a line. They didn't outright insult the ex, but they did highlight her shortcomings in a way that might make the daughter question her hero choice. The AITA community often considers intentions and actions. The author's goal was to make the daughter aware of the support they provide, but the method might be seen as unfair or manipulative. The answer might lean towards A (author is wrong) because they tried to steer the daughter's answer, which could be seen as undermining the mother, even if indirectly. Alternatively, B (not wrong) if the author is justified in feeling unappreciated and their response was a reasonable attempt to correct the daughter's perspective. \n\nI need to determine the balance here. The author has a right to feel frustrated but should approach the situation more carefully. The answer might be A because the author is trying to influence the daughter's answer to the pageant question, which could be seen as interfering with the child's autonomy and perception of her mother. Even though the author isn't directly negative, they are subtly undermining the mother's role. In co-parenting situations, it's usually advised to avoid putting kids in the middle. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for involving the daughter in their resentment.\n"
