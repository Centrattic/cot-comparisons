She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The author is a stepdad who's had to step in as a single parent for three years, providing for the kids financially and emotionally. The ex-wife has a history of problematic behavior but the children still idolize her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is frustrated because the kids don't recognize the stepmom's and his efforts. He doesn't want to badmouth the ex, but he's hurt that they don't see her flaws. The key point is whether his reaction is justified. \n\nHe did have a conversation with his daughter about her hero question. He pointed out the family structure, their support, and the fact that the kids live with them. He didn't directly insult the ex, but he did contrast the stepmom's and his role versus the ex's. That might come off as undermining the ex in the kids' eyes, even if he's not doing it intentionally.\n\nBut the author's main issue is resentment. He's providing everything, yet the kids still look up to their biological mom despite her shortcomings. Is it fair for him to feel this way? Well, it's natural to want recognition for one's efforts. However, the way he addressed the daughter's question might be subtly critical of the ex, which could affect the kids' perspective. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's expressing his feelings of being underappreciated without attacking the ex directly, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's trying to sway the kids to not see their mom as a hero, that's problematic. The line between expressing frustration and manipulating the children's opinions is thin here.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's remarried and stepmom is involved adds another layer. The stepmom is providing all these things, but the kids might still have a natural bond with their biological mother. The author's resentment might stem from feeling unappreciated, but the children's feelings towards their birth mother are complex and may not be his to control.\n\nIn the end, the author might be in the right to feel frustrated, but the way he's handling it could be harmful if it's meant to diminish the ex in the kids' eyes. However, since he's not outright badmouthing her, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is whether he's trying to actively influence the kids' hero choice. Since he's pointing out the facts of their living situation, it's more about clarifying reality rather than devaluing the ex. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
