She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent, step-parent, and the children's views of their mother.\n\nFirst, the father is a single parent for three years, handling a lot on his own. He's remarried, and the stepmom is providing everything the kids need. They pay for healthcare, activities, school stuff, even a car for the son. They also don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. The father says he's forgiven her.\n\nNow, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out that they have family over there, they provide for her, and that the ex only sees the kids every other weekend with no chores. He's trying to explain the reality but is frustrated that the kids see the ex as an angel.\n\nThe key points here are the father's frustration and his response. He's not denigrating the ex, but he's making a comparison to highlight the stepmom's role. The question is whether his response is wrong.\n\nLegally, the father isn't required to provide for the children if he's remarried, but he is. Emotionally, he's trying to balance between not wanting to hurt the kids' view of their mom and feeling unappreciated. His response to the daughter might be seen as trying to explain the situation, but he's also expressing frustration. However, he didn't directly criticize the mother; he just highlighted the stepmom's contributions.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, if he's trying to make the daughter question her choice, maybe he's overstepping. But considering the context of his sacrifices, it's a common issue in blended families. The line between expressing frustration and being unfair might be thin here. The father's intentions are to make the daughter aware of the stepmom's role, but the method could be problematic. However, given the circumstances, it might not be entirely his fault. The answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
