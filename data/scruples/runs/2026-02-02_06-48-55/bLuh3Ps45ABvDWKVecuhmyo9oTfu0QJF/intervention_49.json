She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a stepfather who's providing a lot for his stepchildren, but the kids still see their mother (the author's ex-wife) as a hero. The author expressed frustration to his daughter about this during a pageant preparation, pointing out the differences in their living situations and the efforts he and his wife make.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a single dad for three years, learned to braid hair, remarried, provides for the kids, pays for activities, healthcare, etc. The mother is described as problematic\u2014jail, affairs, can't support herself. The author doesn't ask for child support. The daughter is considering naming her mother as a hero and the author responds by highlighting the stepfamily's efforts versus the mother's limited involvement.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't directly criticize the mother but tried to explain the disparity. He wants the kids to appreciate their stepfamily but doesn't want to damage the mother's image. The question is whether his approach is wrong. \n\nPossible angles: He's trying to correct the kids' perception by pointing out the reality, which might be fair. However, even if the mother is problematic, the kids still have a relationship with her, and the stepfather's role is to support the children without undermining the mother, especially if they have visitation. The author's frustration is valid but how he expresses it might cross a line. By highlighting the mother's shortcomings (food stamps, no chores, etc.), he's indirectly criticizing her, which could affect the kids' perception. The kids might feel conflicted or pressured not to admire their mother. \n\nIn family dynamics, it's often advised to avoid speaking negatively about the other parent, regardless of the circumstances. The stepfather's intention is to make the kids appreciate his efforts, but doing so by contrasting with the mother's lack of effort could be seen as undermining her, even if it's indirect. The author might not be in the wrong if he's just stating facts, but if it's meant to sway the child's opinion, that's where it could be problematic. \n\nThe daughter's question is about who her hero is, and the stepfather's response might be an attempt to guide her towards recognizing his and his wife's support. However, the kids should have the freedom to choose their heroes without pressure. The stepfather's tone might come off as dismissive or invalidating of the mother's role, even if he's not outright badmouthing her. \n\nIn conclusion, while the stepfather's frustration is understandable, his approach in this conversation might be inappropriate. He's using the child's potential pageant answer as a way to critique the mother's parenting, which could harm the child's relationship with her mother. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's undermining the mother's image through the child, even if subtly, which isn't advisable.\n"
