She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a stepfather who's taking care of his children full-time, providing everything they need, while the mother has a history of issues like jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The stepdad and his wife don't ask for child support, and they've even covered the costs for the daughter's pageant. However, when the daughter asks if she should name her mom as her hero, the stepdad responds by pointing out the mother's lack of responsibility and the differences in their living situations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the stepdad's actions. He's providing for the kids' needs without expecting child support, which shows responsibility. But when the daughter questions if the mom is her hero, his response seems to highlight the mother's shortcomings. Is it right for him to bring up the mother's issues in front of the child, even if he's not directly criticizing her? The stepdad mentions he doesn't want to hurt the mother and has forgiven her, yet he's frustrated that the kids see her as a hero despite her problems.\n\nThe key point here is whether the stepdad overstepped by mentioning the mother's situation. Even though he's not directly badmouthing her, he's pointing out the contrast between his full-time parenting and the mother's part-time role. This could potentially influence the child's perception of her mother, even if indirectly. The daughter is trying to choose a hero, and the stepdad's response might be steering her thoughts. \n\nAlso, the mother's rights as a parent come into play. Even if she's not a great parent, the children have a relationship with her, and the stepdad's comments could affect that bond. The stepdad's frustration is understandable, but the way he addressed the daughter's question might be inappropriate. It's possible that the daughter is just trying to please her biological mother by choosing her as a hero, and the stepdad's reaction might be seen as undermining her choice without the child's understanding of the full context.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepdad is providing a lot of support and might feel unappreciated. However, the best approach in co-parenting situations is usually to avoid speaking negatively about the other parent, even when there are valid reasons. The stepdad's response could be seen as crossing a line by influencing the child's perception, even if his intentions are to highlight his own efforts. So, while his feelings are valid, his method of addressing the situation might be wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
