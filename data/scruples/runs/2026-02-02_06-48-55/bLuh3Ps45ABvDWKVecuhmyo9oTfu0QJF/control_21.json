She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a step-parent who's providing a lot for the kids, but the kids still see their biological mom as a hero, which the author finds frustrating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex-wife has a troubled history\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The current step-parent and their spouse are taking care of the kids, covering all expenses, and providing support. The author feels resentful that the kids don't appreciate their efforts and still idolize the mother.\n\nThe key moment is when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out the family's contributions and the contrast with the mother's limited involvement. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex, but feels frustrated that the kids don't recognize their care.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's step-parent is clearly doing a lot for the kids, but the kids' perception is influenced by their limited time with the biological mom. The author's reaction was to highlight their own efforts, which might be seen as a way to address the imbalance in the kids' perspectives. However, the author did not directly criticize the ex-wife, just emphasized their own role.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author is expressing frustration and trying to guide the daughter's thinking. It's a common issue in step-parenting where the biological parent's negative actions don't align with the child's view. The author isn't belittling the ex-wife but is trying to help the daughter see the reality. While it's natural to feel hurt, the approach taken here is about explaining their situation without attacking the mother. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to address their feelings without being malicious. They're advocating for their role as caregivers, which is valid. The frustration is there, but the response was measured and focused on their own contributions rather than tearing down the ex-wife.\n"
