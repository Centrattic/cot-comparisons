She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepfather who feels resentful that his children still see their mother as a hero, even though she has a history of problems. The stepfather has taken on a lot as a single dad for three years, providing for the kids after remarriage, while the mother isn't contributing and has a troubled background.\n\nThe key moment is when the daughter asks about who to say is her hero for a pageant, and the stepfather responds by pointing out the mother's inconsistent parenting and the stepfamily's support. The question is whether his response was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother has a history of issues\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The stepfather has stepped in to provide everything, including healthcare, activities, and even future plans like a car and braces. He's given up child support to avoid hurting her but is now frustrated because the kids still idolize their mother.\n\nThe stepfather's response to the daughter was direct. He mentioned the family's contributions and contrasted it with the mother's limited role. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if his approach was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the stepfather is expressing legitimate frustration. He's doing a lot for the kids, and it's natural to feel overlooked. However, he's the one providing care now, and the mother's role, though problematic, isn't entirely absent. The stepfather's response might be seen as undermining the mother in front of the child, even if he doesn't outright criticize her. This could damage the child's perception of both parents, especially since the mother isn't present full-time.\n\nBut wait, the stepfather says he's not derogatory towards the mother. He wants the kids to have a positive image of her. However, by highlighting the mother's lack of support and the stepfamily's efforts, he's indirectly making a comparison. The daughter might feel conflicted, torn between acknowledging the stepfamily's support and the mother's role. \n\nIn child custody situations, it's often advised for parents to maintain a respectful image of each other to avoid confusing or alienating the children. The stepfather's response could be seen as pushing the child to value the stepfamily over the mother, even if he's not outright badmouthing her. This might not be in the child's best interest, as it could create loyalty conflicts or make the child feel they have to choose between parents.\n\nHowever, the mother's actions (like living with her mom, using food stamps, not supporting the kids financially) do contribute to the situation. The stepfather isn't forcing the kids to not see their mother; they visit her every other weekend. But the way he's handling the daughter's question might be overstepping, as he's using it to highlight the stepfamily's role rather than letting the child form her own opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the stepfather's feelings are understandable, his response might be inappropriate because it's using the child's question to express his own frustrations, potentially influencing the child's perception. This could lead to the child feeling pressured to favor the stepfamily, even if it's not intentional. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his response could be harmful to the child's relationship with her mother and is using a personal moment to assert his role rather than allowing the child to explore her own feelings.\n"
