She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mom as a hero, given the context of her being a \"perennial fuck up\" and the stepmom and him providing for the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is a stepfather who's been taking care of the kids after the mother, who has multiple issues (jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom), didn't provide support. The kids live with him full-time, and he's been covering all their needs. Now, the daughter is asking if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant question. The author responds by pointing out the stepfamily's support versus the mother's limited involvement. \n\nThe key points here are the author's resentment and his response to the daughter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author's response does seem to imply a comparison between the stepmom's and biological mother's roles, highlighting the mother's lack of responsibility. However, he says he doesn't want to derogate the mother, but his words might be influencing the kids to not admire her. \n\nIs it wrong to feel resentful in this situation? Resentment is a natural emotion when you feel unappreciated. However, expressing that to a child in a way that undermines their relationship with their biological parent could be problematic. The author is trying to make the child aware of the realities, which might be valid, but the approach could be leading the child to question her admiration of her mother. \n\nAlso, the mother isn't present full-time, so the child's limited exposure might lead to an idolized view. The author is trying to balance that, but there's a line between guiding a child's perspective and invalidating their feelings. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for his reaction. If he's being honest about the mother's shortcomings to help the child form a realistic view, maybe not. But if he's trying to sabotage the child's perception of the mother, then yes. The author mentions he's forgiven her but is frustrated by the children's lack of appreciation for him and the stepmom. \n\nIn family dynamics, especially in custody situations, it's important to avoid badmouthing the other parent, even if justified. The author might be trying to protect the child from being influenced by a problematic parent, but his method might be too direct. The answer hinges on whether his intent was to genuinely guide the child or to express his own resentment. The response he gave the daughter could be seen as steering her away from choosing her mother as a hero, which might not be entirely fair. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he's addressing a real issue where the mother isn't contributing much. However, the way he's doing it could be better handled. But based on the scenario, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about the circumstances while trying to make the child aware of the stepfamily's role. However, there's a counterargument that he's still influencing the child's perception negatively, which could make him in the wrong. \n\nI need to decide: Is honesty and transparency about the mother's situation acceptable, or is it wrong to sway a child's opinion? If the latter, then A. If the former, then B. The line here is thin. Since the author is not directly badmouthing but pointing out facts (like chores and food stamps), maybe B is more accurate. However, the context of the mother being a \"fuck up\" in his narrative might color his perception. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate objectively. The author's actions might be justified if he's trying to help the child understand the reality, but if he's projecting his resentment onto the child, it's wrong. The answer likely depends on whether the intent was to help the child or express personal frustration. Given the author's statement that he doesn't want to cripple her image but is frustrated, it's a mix, but the response he gave could be seen as steering her, hence A. Wait, but the mother isn't present full-time, so the child's perception is based on limited interaction. The author is trying to balance that. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about the mother's limitations and the stepfamily's contributions, which is necessary for the child to have a balanced view. However, the way he communicates it might be harsh, but the intent isn't malicious. Alternatively, if the intent is to make the child choose between the mother and the stepfamily, then A. But the author's goal seems to be making the child aware of the realities, not to badmouth. So, B is more accurate.\n"
