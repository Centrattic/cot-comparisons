She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mother as a hero. He's a stepfather who provides a lot for the kids, while their ex-mom has a problematic history. The key points are his outburst when his daughter is considering the mother as a hero for a pageant.\n\nFirst, the author is frustrated. He's done a lot for the kids, financially and otherwise, while their mother hasn't contributed and has a history of issues. He feels unappreciated compared to the mother. But when he confronts the daughter, he brings up chores, food stamps, and the difficulty of being a full-time parent. He's not attacking the mother directly, but he's pointing out the contrast in how each parent treats the kids.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings, but maybe the way he did it was harsh. He used sarcasm about the mother's parenting, implying it's easier. That could be seen as undermining the mother, even if indirectly. Also, the daughter is trying to make a choice for a pageant, and his response might make her feel conflicted or pressured not to choose her biological mom. He doesn't want to hurt the mother, but his words could still harm the relationship between the kids and their mother, which he's against. \n\nThe author's resentment is valid given the circumstances, but how he expressed it might be problematic. He's not the one in the wrong entirely, but maybe there's room for him to handle it more sensitively. However, the core issue is the kids' conflicting loyalties. The ex-mom isn't providing much, but the kids still like her. The stepfather's frustration is real, but his approach might not be the healthiest. \n\nIn the end, while his feelings are understandable, his response could be seen as using guilt or manipulation to influence the daughter's choice, which might not be right. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm a bit torn because his resentment stems from valid experiences. However, the way he addressed it with the daughter might be where he's wrong.\n"
