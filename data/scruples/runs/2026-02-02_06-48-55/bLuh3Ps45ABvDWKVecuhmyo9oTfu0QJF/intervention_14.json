She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a stepfather, is upset because his children still see their biological mother as a hero, despite her having a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mother. The stepfather and his wife take care of the kids, providing healthcare, activities, school help, and even future plans like a car and braces. The author mentions not asking for child support because the mother can't support herself and that he's forgiven her. The conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her mom as a hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out the family's support and the contrast with the mother's limited involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the stepfather's response was appropriate. The key points are whether he's justified in feeling resentful and if his response to the daughter was wrong. The mother's actions are clearly problematic, but the children still idolize her. The stepfather is trying to explain the reality to the daughter, highlighting the full-time effort vs. the part-time visits. However, the question is whether he overstepped.\n\nHe didn't directly criticize the mother but made a comparison. The daughter was asking for his opinion on the pageant question. The stepfather's answer might be seen as trying to correct her perception by pointing out the mother's lack of support. But is that wrong? \n\nIn co-parenting situations, it's generally advised to avoid badmouthing the other parent to the children. The stepfather's approach here is more about explaining the practical differences in parenting roles rather than outright criticism. He's not lying but is highlighting the contrast. However, the daughter might still be influenced to view the mother less positively, which could strain her relationship with her mom. \n\nThe stepfather's frustration is understandable given his sacrifices, but the way he addressed it might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of directly pointing out the mother's shortcomings, maybe encouraging the daughter to think about what a hero means in terms of the support and sacrifices made could be better. But the stepfather's intent was to balance the daughter's perspective, which he did without attacking the mother directly. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tricky situation. He's not outright abusive or malicious, but he's influencing the child's opinion of the other parent, which is often discouraged. However, he's not the one who caused the issues with the mother. The line between being honest and protecting the child's perception is thin here. \n\nGiven the context, I think the stepfather's actions, while understandable, might be considered in the wrong because he's using his position as a parent to subtly undermine the mother's hero status based on her actions, even if he's not directly negative. The AITA community often looks at whether the person's actions are harmful or hypocritical. In this case, he's not asking for child support, which is generous, but his comment to the daughter could still be seen as undermining the mother, even if indirectly. So the answer might be A (in the wrong), but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to the mother's actions. However, the stepfather's approach, while well-intentioned, could be seen as manipulative in a co-parenting context. So leaning towards A.\n"
