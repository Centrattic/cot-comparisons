She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their ex-wife, who they describe as having a problematic history\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, etc. The author is a stepfather who's providing for the kids now, and they feel resentful that the kids still see their biological mother as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions they have forgiven their ex and don't want to hurt her, but the kids spend time with her every other weekend. The daughter in the story is preparing for a pageant and considering naming her biological mom as a hero. The author's response is to point out the contrast between the stepfamily's constant support and the ex's inconsistent care. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to express frustration? Well, the author did not directly criticize the ex in front of the child, but they did highlight the differences between the two family situations. The daughter might pick up on this, possibly leading to guilt or confusion. The key issue is whether the author should have handled the situation differently. \n\nThe author's actions here seem to stem from a place of wanting to be fair and realistic but might inadvertently be undermining the mother's influence without the ex's knowledge. The stepmom and the author are the ones providing for the children's needs, yet the kids still idolize the biological mother. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of questioning the daughter's choice in the context given might be seen as manipulating the child's perception. \n\nIn family situations, especially with custody arrangements, it's generally advised not to speak negatively about the other parent in front of the children. The author didn't outright insult the ex, but by contrasting their own sacrifices with the ex's easier parenting schedule, they might be influencing the child's view. This could be considered wrong, as it's not the child's fault their mother is problematic, and the author's stepmom is the one providing care now. The author might be overstepping by framing the mother's parenting as easier, which could cause the child to feel conflicted or guilty.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings of resentment are valid and their sacrifices are significant, the way they addressed the daughter's question could be seen as inappropriate. They might be in the wrong for trying to sway the child's opinion of her mother, even indirectly. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shouldn't have used that moment to highlight the differences between their parenting and the ex's, potentially manipulating the child's feelings.\n"
