She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a stepfather who is a single dad for three years, taking care of three kids. He's remarried, and he and his wife provide everything for the kids. The kids see their biological mom as a hero, even though she has a troubled history with jail, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author feels resentful because the kids don't appreciate what he and his wife do for them.\n\nHe talks about a specific incident where his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. He responds by pointing out that they provide for the kids, take care of them, and that their mom only sees them every other weekend. He doesn't want to hurt the ex-wife but is frustrated that the kids idolize her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, on one hand, the author is clearly putting a lot of effort into providing for the kids and feels unappreciated. On the other hand, the kids are still young and their biological mom is their mother, so they might naturally look up to her even if she's not a good parent. The author's response to his daughter seems a bit harsh, maybe trying to make her realize the reality of the situation. But is it wrong to feel that way?\n\nI think the key points here are about how the author expressed his feelings. He didn't outright say negative things about the ex-wife, but he did imply that being a parent part-time is easier. He also mentioned that the ex doesn't contribute financially, but he's the one providing everything. However, he's the one who's supposed to take care of the kids now. The fact that the kids still admire their biological mom might be natural, and the author's frustration is valid, but his approach might not be the healthiest. Maybe he should focus on building their appreciation for what he and his wife do instead of trying to undermine their perception of the mom. But is he technically in the wrong? Or is it just a matter of perspective?\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's doing a lot for the kids and feels unappreciated. However, his method of addressing his daughter's question might not be appropriate. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a mix. The author's resentment is justified, but expressing it in that way could be problematic. However, he didn't directly criticize the mom, just explained the situation. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
