She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who was a single dad for three years, then remarried, providing for their children financially and emotionally. The ex-wife is described as having multiple issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mother. The author pays for everything the kids need, doesn't ask for child support, and is frustrated that the children still see their mother as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is a step-parent who's taking care of the kids and is upset that the kids still idolize their problematic biological mother. The daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero, prompting the author's response pointing out the other parent's shortcomings. \n\nThe author claims they don't want to hurt the mother or derogate her but are frustrated the kids don't appreciate what they and their stepmother are doing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing these feelings to the daughter in that context.\n\nPossible angles: The author is the one providing care and financial support, yet the children still have a positive image of their absent mother. The author's frustration is valid, but how they expressed it might be the issue. When the daughter asked if she should cite her mom as a hero, the author's response lists the mother's shortcomings and contrasts it with their own efforts. This could be seen as undermining the mother in front of the child, even if done with good intentions. \n\nBut the author also mentions they don't want to derogate the mother, so maybe they're trying to balance honesty with protecting the child's feelings. However, the mother's actions are factual (e.g., food stamps, lack of jobs), so pointing those out might not be entirely unfair. Yet, doing so when the child is preparing for a pageant and specifically asking about a hero could be seen as a moment to guide the child's perception, which might cross into manipulation.\n\nOn the flip side, the author has done a lot for the kids and isn't receiving appreciation. The ex-wife isn't contributing financially, and the author isn't asking for support. The frustration might be justified, but the way they're expressing it to the child could be problematic. The child is in a position where they have to choose between two parental figures, and the author is trying to influence that choice by pointing out the mother's flaws. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have forgiven the ex-wife, which suggests they're not acting out of spite but frustration. However, using the child's pageant preparation as a moment to critique the mother's parenting could be seen as using the child to vent personal feelings. It's possible the author's actions are in the wrong because they're influencing the child's perception of their mother, even if indirectly. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be justified in feeling overlooked and trying to make the child aware of the reality of the mother's situation. The answer might depend on cultural norms around parent-child relationships and step-parent dynamics. In some views, it's wrong to critique the biological parent in front of the child, even if the parent has issues. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using the child's question to express their frustration and possibly manipulate the child's view of their mother. Even if the author's intentions are to highlight their contributions, doing so in the context of a pageant interview could be seen as taking advantage of the situation to steer the child's answer. Alternatively, if the mother's actions are as problematic as described, the author's response is factual, but the method of delivery could still be wrong. \n\nI think the key is whether the author had the right to bring up the mother's shortcomings in that specific context. Even if the facts are true, using the child's question as a platform to critique the mother might be inappropriate. The author should focus on their own role without undermining the other parent, especially in front of the child. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
