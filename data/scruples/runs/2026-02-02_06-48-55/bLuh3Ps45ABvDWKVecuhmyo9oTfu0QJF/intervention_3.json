She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the father, his ex-wife who has a troubled history, and his current wife taking care of their kids. The daughter is in a pageant and asked if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out the ex's shortcomings, even though he's being supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the father's actions. He's a stepdad who's doing a lot for the kids\u2014paying for everything, providing care, etc. He's not directly attacking the ex but is trying to explain the difference in their lives. His goal is to correct the daughter's skewed perception of her biological mom. However, he's frustrated because the kids idolize the ex despite her issues. \n\nThe key points here are whether his response was appropriate. He didn't insult the ex directly but used logic to highlight that she's only a part-time parent. This could be seen as trying to influence the daughter's viewpoint, which might be harmful. Kids should have the freedom to form their own opinions about their parents. The father might be trying to undermine the ex's image to make his stepfamily look better, even if he's not doing it maliciously. \n\nOn the other hand, he's raising a valid concern about the ex's inability to support herself and the children. However, the way he responded could make the daughter question her choices and potentially feel guilty for liking her mom. This might not be healthy for the child's emotional development. The father's intention is to highlight the real-life circumstances, but the method might be inappropriate. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not directly abusive or threatening, but he's manipulating the daughter's perspective. Since he's in a position of authority as a parent, his influence could be significant. The fact that he says he doesn't want to hurt the ex but is still trying to shape the daughter's opinion might tip the balance. So, perhaps the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's trying to control the daughter's answer and undermine the ex, even if indirectly.\n"
