She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the stepfather, who is the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post, is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mother as a hero, despite her history of issues and him providing for them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex-wife has a problematic history\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The stepfather has been a single dad for three years, taking care of their three kids. He's remarried, and he and his new wife take care of the kids' needs: healthcare, activities, school projects, even buying a car for the 16-year-old son and braces for the daughter. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself and he's forgiven her.\n\nThe key event is his daughter asking if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. The stepfather responds by pointing out that they provide for her full-time, while the mom only sees the kids every other weekend and has it easier. He's frustrated that the kids don't appreciate their stepmom and him, but he hasn't derogated the mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the elements. He's expressing his feelings of being unappreciated, which is a common issue in blended families. He's not directly harming the kids or their relationship with their mom, but he's voicing his frustration. The problem might be that he's using the daughter's pageant question to subtly undermine the mother's image, which could affect the child's perception. However, he's also trying to make the daughter aware of the realities of both parents' situations.\n\nHe states he hasn't derogated the mother, but his comment about the mother's easier parenting (no chores, food stamps) might be seen as undermining her. However, he's also being honest about the mother's circumstances. The stepfather's frustration is valid given his sacrifices, but he's not necessarily in the wrong because he's not directly harming the kids' relationship with their mother. He's just expressing his feelings and giving a perspective.\n\nHowever, there's a line between expressing feelings and undermining the other parent. Even if the mother isn't a good parent, the stepfather should consider the child's emotional needs. The daughter is eight, so she might not fully grasp the context of her mother's situation. The stepfather's response might be seen as manipulating the child's perception, which could be harmful in the long run.\n\nBut the stepfather's main point is about his own feelings of resentment and the lack of appreciation. He's not directly attacking the mother but is highlighting the contrast between the two parenting scenarios. It's a delicate balance. In co-parenting situations, it's important to maintain the child's relationship with both parents, even if one parent isn't contributing financially. The stepfather's approach here might be seen as a way to make the child aware of the realities, but it could also be seen as pushing his own agenda.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, from a child's perspective, having both parents (biological and step) support and validate each other's roles is important. The stepfather's frustration is valid, but the way he addresses it might not be the healthiest approach for the child's emotional well-being. Therefore, while his feelings are understandable, his method of expressing them could be considered wrong because it's using the child as a messenger to compare and potentially diminish the mother's role, even if indirectly.\n\nBut wait, he's also being honest about the facts. The mother's circumstances are what they are, and the stepfather is pointing out the disparity in effort. However, the daughter's perspective might not align with that, especially if the mother is affectionate during visitation. The stepfather's frustration is about not being seen as the hero, which is a common issue in step-parenting. But he's not in the wrong because he's advocating for his own family's contributions. It's a complex situation where both parents are doing their best under different circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the stepfather's resentment is valid, but the way he's handling it might not be the healthiest. However, he's not directly in the wrong for expressing his feelings, especially since he's providing for the kids. The mother's lack of support is a given, and his frustration stems from the kids' lack of appreciation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's not actively harming the kids' relationship with their mother, and his actions are a result of his sacrifices and the mother's circumstances.\n"
