She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mother as a hero, despite the mother's history of issues.\n\nFirst, the author's ex-wife has a problematic past: jail, affairs, job issues, and dependency. The author took on single parenting, then remarried, and the stepmom is very involved. They provide for the kids financially and emotionally. The ex doesn't pay child support because she can't support herself. The author doesn't want to hurt her and has forgiven her.\n\nNow, the daughter is doing a pageant where she's asked about her hero. The daughter asks if she should say \"my mom.\" The author responds by pointing out that the mother isn't the primary caregiver, highlighting the stepmom's role. The author says they don't want to denigrate the mother but feel frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what they do.\n\nThe key points here: The author's frustration is about the children idolizing the mother despite her shortcomings, while the stepmom and they handle the parenting. The author's response to the daughter includes some subtle comparisons, like mentioning the mother's lack of chores and food stamps, implying that the stepmom is more involved. But the author says they don't derogate the mother.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether it's wrong to feel resentful about the kids idolizing the mother. The author is not directly belittling the mother, just expressing frustration. However, the response to the daughter might be influencing her perception. The author might be projecting their own resentment onto the child, which could affect the child's relationship with her mother. Even if the author's intentions are good, they might be undermining the mother's relationship with the kids, which the mother is allowed to have, even if she's not perfect.\n\nIn family dynamics, maintaining relationships between children and both parents is important, even if one parent is flawed. The author might be right to feel underappreciated, but the way they expressed it could be seen as inappropriate. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're influencing the child's view of the mother, even if indirectly. Alternatively, B if they're justified in their feelings. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong for their actions, not just the feelings, the answer might be A.\n"
