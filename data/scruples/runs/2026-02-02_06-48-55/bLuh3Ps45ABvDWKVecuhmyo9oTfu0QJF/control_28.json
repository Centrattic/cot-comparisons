She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-wife has a troubled history\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The father stepped in as a single dad, took care of the kids, remarried, and now provides everything. He doesn't want child support because she can't support herself. The conflict arises when his daughter, who lives with him full-time, asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. He responds by pointing out that they provide for her and that the mom only sees the kids every other weekend with fewer responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the morality and ethics here. The father is clearly providing a lot for the kids, but he's upset that they idolize their ex-mom who isn't as involved. The key here is whether his response was wrong. He didn't directly attack the ex-wife but pointed out the reality of their living situation. The daughter is just trying to prepare for a pageant question, so maybe she's confused about which mom to choose. The father's frustration is valid, but was his response inappropriate?\n\nHe didn't force her to choose, just explained the situation. It's possible that he's projecting his own feelings onto the kids, but he's trying to be fair and not hurt the ex-wife. The kids might have a positive relationship with their mom despite her flaws. The father's response might be seen as trying to correct their perspective, but is that wrong? He's not forbidding them from loving their mom, just reminding them of the circumstances. \n\nSome might argue that it's wrong to influence the kids' opinions about their mother, even if she's problematic. Others might say he's justified in wanting them to appreciate his and his wife's efforts. The line between being a concerned parent and undermining the ex-wife's role is thin here. The father isn't badmouthing her, just stating facts. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no hidden wrongdoing. He's not taking away visitation or anything, just expressing frustration. The daughter's question is innocent, but the father's response is honest about the reality. So, he's not the asshole here.\n"
