She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author resenting that his children see their mother as a hero despite her history of issues. The author has been a single dad for three years, remarried, and provides for the kids, while the ex-mother has a troubled background and can't support herself. The daughter is asking about putting her mom as her hero for a pageant, and the author responds by pointing out the ex's shortcomings and the stepfamily's support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is clearly struggling with the children's idealized view of their mother, given the mother's history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mother. The author's stepfamily supports the kids financially and emotionally. The author didn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself and claims to have forgiven her. However, the frustration comes out when talking to the daughter about the pageant question.\n\nThe critical moment is when the author responds to his daughter's question about who to name as her hero. The author brings up the mother's failings and contrasts it with the stepfamily's support. Even though the author says he's not derogatory towards the ex, this conversation might be planting seeds of doubt in the children's minds about their mother. The author is worried about the kids not appreciating what their stepmother and he do for them, but is it right to use this approach?\n\nFrom a child's perspective, they have two parents, even if one is absent or problematic. The mother, despite her flaws, is still a parent, and the children might naturally have a positive image of her, especially if they spend time with her. The author's response could make the children feel conflicted about their feelings, possibly feeling they should be grateful to the stepfamily but also have a relationship with their biological mother. This might harm the children's emotional well-being, creating loyalty conflicts or resentment towards the mother. \n\nMoreover, the author's approach might be undermining the mother without her being present to defend herself, which isn't fair to her. Even if the mother has issues, the children should be allowed to form their own opinions and relationships with her unless there's immediate harm. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he's addressing it could be harmful. Instead of criticizing the mother in front of the children, he might consider discussing his feelings with the ex-wife or a counselor to find a way to balance the children's relationships without damaging their views of either parent.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect the children from an unreliable parent, his method of subtly discrediting the mother in a private conversation with the daughter could be considered wrong because it may harm the children's relationship with their mother and create unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
