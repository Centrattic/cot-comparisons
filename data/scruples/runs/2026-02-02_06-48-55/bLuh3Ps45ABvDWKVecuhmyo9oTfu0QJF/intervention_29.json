She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a parent who's a step-parent, trying to raise their children after the mother has a history of issues. The step-parent is frustrated that the kids still see their biological mom as a hero, despite the step-parent and their spouse providing all the financial and emotional support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The ex-wife has a problematic history\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The step-parent and their partner have taken over full care, even not asking for child support. The daughter is about to enter a pageant where she might say her mom is her hero. The step-parent responds by pointing out that they are the ones providing everything, while her mom only sees the kids part-time and doesn't have chores, etc.\n\nThe author is upset that the kids don't recognize their efforts and still idolize the mother. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing frustration in that conversation.\n\nI need to consider child custody dynamics, co-parenting responsibilities, and the impact of the step-parent's response on the children. The step-parent isn't directly attacking the mother but is trying to highlight their own contributions. However, the way they framed it might be making the child feel conflicted or pressured to choose sides. \n\nIn co-parenting situations, it's generally advised to avoid undermining the other parent, even if they're not a good parent. The step-parent's role is to support the children without replacing the biological parent. By pointing out the mother's shortcomings, even indirectly, they might be creating tension between the child and the mother, which could harm the child's relationship with both parents.\n\nAlso, the step-parent's frustration is valid, but the approach might be problematic. Instead of highlighting the mother's lack of contributions, maybe focusing on their own role and expressing feelings without belittling the other parent would be better. The step-parent isn't the biological parent, so their emotional labor and sacrifices are significant, but they can't control the children's perceptions, especially if the mother is still an active, if flawed, figure in their lives.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They aren't directly abusive or malicious, but their response could be seen as manipulating the child's perspective. The answer might lean towards A (wrong) because they're trying to influence the child's view of the mother negatively, even if it's through facts. However, some might argue that the step-parent is justified in their frustration. But generally, in co-parenting, it's better to let the child form their own opinions without pressure. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for trying to sway the child's hero choice rather than supporting the child's autonomy.\n"
