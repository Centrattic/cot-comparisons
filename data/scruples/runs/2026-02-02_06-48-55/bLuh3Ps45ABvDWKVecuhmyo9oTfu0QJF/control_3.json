She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children view their mother as a hero. The author's ex-wife has a history of negative behaviors, and the stepmom and the father are providing for the kids. The key point is the father's response to his daughter's question about the pageant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's perspective. He's been a single dad, provided everything for the kids, and resents the fact that the kids still see their mother positively despite her flaws. His response to his daughter was a bit direct, pointing out the other parent's shortcomings. But he hasn't derogated her and wants to maintain a positive image. \n\nLegally, the ex-wife might not be paying child support, but the father isn't asking for it. The emotional aspect is tricky. Children often have a natural bond with their biological parent, which might make them view the mother as a hero regardless of her actions. The father's frustration is understandable, but his approach could be seen as trying to undermine the ex-wife's influence. However, he's not directly badmouthing her, just highlighting the contrast in how the kids are treated by both parents.\n\nThe main issue is whether the father overstepped. He's expressing his feelings to his daughter about the disparity in how the ex is perceived versus their current care. But in a custody situation, especially where the kids see the mother only part-time, it's common for children to still have a strong emotional connection. The father's frustration is valid, but his approach might be problematic if it's making the daughter feel conflicted about her choices.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, it's important for children to have both parents in their lives, even with a flawed parent. The father's role is to support the kids without denouncing the other parent, even if he disagrees with their admiration. However, he's not outright criticizing the mother, just explaining the differences in responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's actions stem from a place of feeling undervalued despite his efforts. The question is whether he's justified in expressing his frustration. While it's natural to feel resentful, the way he addressed it with his daughter might be causing unintended pressure on her to choose sides. The answer likely leans towards the father not being in the wrong because he's not actively harming the mother's image but is expressing his feelings. However, there's a need to balance this with the children's emotional well-being.\n"
