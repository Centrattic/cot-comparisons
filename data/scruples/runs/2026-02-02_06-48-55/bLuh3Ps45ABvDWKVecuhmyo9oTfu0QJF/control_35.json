She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is a stepfather who's been taking care of his ex's kids. The ex is described as having a lot of problems: jail, affairs, job issues, and now living with her mom. The stepfather and his wife have been providing for the kids financially and emotionally, doing all sorts of things like paying for healthcare, activities, school projects, even a car for the son and braces for the daughter. The dad doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself, and he says he's forgiven her.\n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom (the ex) is her hero. The dad responds by pointing out that the kids live with them full-time, that they provide everything, and that their mom only sees them every other weekend with no chores and food stamps. He's frustrated that the kids see the ex as an angel and don't appreciate what their stepfamily does.\n\nSo the question is, is the dad in the wrong here? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad's actions: he's been taking care of the children, providing for their needs, not asking for support from the ex, and trying to be understanding. But when the daughter questions if she should say the ex is her hero, he brings up the comparison between the time and resources each parent provides. He doesn't directly badmouth the ex, but he's highlighting the differences in their parenting styles and the support they offer.\n\nFrom the dad's perspective, he's trying to make the kids aware of the reality of their mother's situation and the sacrifices he and his wife have made. He doesn't want to hurt the ex or the kids' perception of her, but he's frustrated because he feels unappreciated. The key here is whether his response is appropriate.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n- Parental rights and responsibilities. The dad isn't the legal parent, but he's the one providing day-to-day care. The ex has visitation rights, but her time with the kids might be more about bonding rather than care. The dad might feel that his efforts are being overshadowed by the ex's presence in their lives, even if it's limited.\n- The daughter's question is about choosing a hero. The dad's response might be seen as trying to influence her choice by pointing out the practical aspects of parenting. But is that fair? He's not directly telling her not to choose her mom, but he's bringing up the reality that their stepfamily is the one providing the care.\n- The ex's behavior: if she's been negligent (as described), but still has a positive image with the kids, the dad might feel justified in pointing out that discrepancy. However, it's important for the kids to have a relationship with both parents, even if one is problematic.\n- The dad's approach: He's not attacking the ex directly but is highlighting the contrast. This could be seen as a way to encourage the kids to appreciate what they have without necessarily discrediting the other parent. However, it's possible that the kids are still young and might not fully understand the nuances.\n\nLegally, the ex is still the mother, and the dad's role as a stepfather, even though he's the primary caregiver, might not have the same legal standing. However, the emotional aspect is about the kids' perception and the dad's feelings of being undervalued.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the dad is trying to protect the kids' relationship with their mother but also wants them to recognize the support they receive. The response he gave is a bit of a gentle push towards acknowledging their stepfamily's role. It's possible that the daughter might still choose her mom as her hero, but the dad is trying to balance the reality of the situation.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the dad could have expressed his feelings of being unappreciated without contrasting the two parents so directly. But he's not belittling the ex; he's just pointing out the facts of their living situations.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether the dad is justified in his frustration and if his response was a fair way to address it. Since he didn't outright discourage the daughter from choosing her mom but instead explained the situation, it might be seen as a valid expression of his feelings without being in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
