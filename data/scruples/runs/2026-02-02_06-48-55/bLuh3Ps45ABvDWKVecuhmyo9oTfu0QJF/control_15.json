She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who's a stepfather to three kids from his ex-wife. The ex has a bad track record: jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, taking care of them, and now he's remarried. His new wife and he provide for all the kids' needs, including healthcare, activities, school help, even buying a car for the son and braces for the daughter.\n\nThe issue comes up when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that they live with him and his wife, they pay for everything, and that visiting their mom every other weekend is easier since she doesn't have chores and gets food stamps. He doesn't want to hurt their mom's image, but he's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero without appreciating what he and his wife do.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, first, he's not directly criticizing the mother in front of the kids, but he's pointing out the reality of the situation. He's trying to correct their daughter's perception, maybe to help her understand the actual situation. He's been generous and supportive, so maybe he feels his efforts aren't recognized. But he also wants the kids to see the mother's shortcomings, even if he's trying not to be derogatory.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the kids are still influenced by their time with their mom, and the author's response could make the daughter feel conflicted or confused. It's possible that the author's frustration is valid, but the way he addressed it might not be the best. However, he's not outright badmouthing the mother, just explaining the practical aspects.\n\nThe key here is whether he's in the wrong for expressing his feelings and trying to set a realistic perspective. Since he's not attacking the mother directly but highlighting the contrast between the two households, maybe it's justified. The kids are in his care, so he's trying to foster appreciation for their current caregivers. However, there's a risk of making the daughter feel like she should side with them over her mom, which could be harmful.\n\nBut considering the mother's history and the stepfamily's support, the author's frustration is understandable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), as he's trying to balance the kids' perceptions without being negative, while providing for them. However, some might argue that the children should form their own opinions about their mother, and the stepfather shouldn't influence that. It's a tricky situation, but given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
