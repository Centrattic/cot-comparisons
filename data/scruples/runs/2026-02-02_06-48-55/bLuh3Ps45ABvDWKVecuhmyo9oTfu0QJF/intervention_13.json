She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who was a single dad for three years, then remarried. He's providing for his kids, covering all expenses, and he doesn't ask for child support from his ex, who has a history of legal issues, affairs, job instability, and lives with her mom. \n\nThe key point is the conflict over his daughter seeing her mom as a hero. The author had a conversation with his daughter where he pointed out that she lives with him and his wife, who take care of her, while her mom only sees her every other weekend and has an easier time. The author is frustrated that the kids idealize the mother without recognizing the stepmom and him.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't directly criticized the mother in front of the kids. He's trying to make his daughter aware of the different living situations and the effort his wife and he put in. The author mentions he's forgiven the mother, so it's not about revenge but about the kids' perception.\n\nThe ex is clearly not a good role model, but the kids have limited time with her. The author's approach is to explain the reality without badmouthing the mother. He's trying to help the daughter understand the context. \n\nIs it wrong to gently point out the truth to the child? Since the kids are minors, the custodial parent (the author) is responsible for their upbringing. It's reasonable for him to guide their understanding of their family dynamics. However, he should avoid putting the mother down, which he hasn't done. The frustration is valid, but his method seems appropriate\u2014encouraging the daughter to consider the facts rather than just idolizing her mom without context.\n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to balance honesty and protection. He's not attacking the mother but helping the child see the reality of their living arrangements. The key is whether he's being fair, and it seems he is. The author is in a tough spot, handling the situation without negativity, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
