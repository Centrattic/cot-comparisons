She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a single dad who raised his kids for three years, then remarried. He's providing everything for his children, while their mother, who has a troubled history, gets them every other weekend. The stepmom and he don't ask for child support because she can't support herself.\n\nNow, the key part is when the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for the pageant. The father responds by pointing out that the kids live with them full-time, get all their needs met, and that their mother only sees them two weekends a month. He's frustrated because the kids see their mom as a hero despite her issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father wants the kids to recognize the support they receive from him and his wife. However, he's a stepfather, and the kids still have a biological mother who they visit. The question is whether the father's frustration and his response to the daughter are justified.\n\nOn one hand, the father has done a lot for the kids, providing for their needs, and it's reasonable for him to feel unappreciated. On the other hand, the kids are influenced by their time with their mother, who, despite her flaws, is still their mom. The father's comment about the mother's situation (food stamps, not working) might come off as harsh, even if his intention is to highlight the contrast in their support.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? The father didn't directly insult the mother but tried to explain the reality to his daughter. However, by pointing out the mother's shortcomings, he might be undermining the child's perception of her. The daughter is trying to prepare for a question, and the father's response could be seen as guiding her to choose him and his wife over their biological mom, which might not be fair to the daughter's relationship with her mother.\n\nAlso, the father mentions he's never derogated the mother, but his comparison could still be affecting the daughter's view. The daughter's admiration for her mother might be genuine, even if the mother isn't perfect. The father's frustration is understandable, but his approach might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe he should focus on fostering a positive relationship between the children and both parents, rather than emphasizing the comparison.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father's feelings are valid, his response may not be entirely appropriate. It's possible that he's in the wrong (A) because he's influencing the daughter's perception of her mother, even if indirectly. Alternatively, if the mother's actions are as problematic as described, maybe the father isn't in the wrong (B) for trying to highlight the support they provide. This is a tough call. The key is whether the father overstepped by making the comparison. I think the answer leans towards A because he's undermining the daughter's choice and potentially the mother's image, even if with good intentions.\n"
