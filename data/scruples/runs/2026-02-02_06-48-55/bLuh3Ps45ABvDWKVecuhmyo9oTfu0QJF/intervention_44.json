She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's a single dad for three years, providing for his kids after his ex-wife, who has a history of issues, doesn't contribute. Now, the stepmom and he are taking care of the kids, but the kids still see their biological mom as a hero. The father expressed frustration in a conversation with his daughter, pointing out that they live with him and the stepmom, who provide everything, while the ex only sees them every other weekend and has it easier.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know the opinion. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's perspective. He's trying to make the kids aware of the reality of their mother's situation and the effort their stepmom and he put in. He's not directly criticizing the ex but explaining the situation. However, the daughter might feel conflicted if she's trying to choose her hero. The father's response could be seen as subtly undermining the mother's image, even if he's not directly derogatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the children being young might idealize their biological mother, especially if they see her as a positive figure during their visits. The father's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it might be problematic. He's not forcing the daughter to say her stepmom, but he's highlighting the contrast. The key here is whether his comments were undermining the mother or just explaining the facts. If he's being condescending or trying to make the daughter feel guilty for considering her mom, that's an issue. But if he's just pointing out the reality, it's more about guiding her to consider all factors.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person overstepped. The father's intention was to help the daughter consider all aspects, but he might have been dismissive of the mother's role. Even if the mother isn't a good role model, the children's feelings matter. The father's approach could be seen as manipulating the daughter's perception, which is wrong. Alternatively, he's just being honest about the care they receive.\n\nI think the line is thin here. Since he's not outright badmouthing the mother but is pointing out the practicalities, maybe he's in the right. However, the fact that the children still see her as a hero despite her flaws might be a sign that the father's approach is needed. But if he's trying to make the daughter feel that the mother is less of a parent, that's a problem. The answer might depend on the community's view on parental influence over children's perceptions of the other parent.\n"
