She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The author has a pretty negative view of the ex-wife, mentioning her jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. The author and their new wife have been the primary caregivers, providing for the kids' needs, and they don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself.\n\nThe key event here is when the daughter asks if she should say her mother is her hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out the contrast between their full-time care and the ex's part-time visits, implying that the ex's parenting is easier. The author feels frustrated that the kids don't recognize their efforts.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't directly criticize the ex-wife but highlighted their own sacrifices. However, the question is whether that's wrong. The author might be projecting their own feelings onto the daughter, maybe trying to influence her perception of her mother. Even if the author isn't outright badmouthing the ex, they're still setting up a comparison that could make the daughter feel conflicted about her real mom. The author's frustration is understandable, but trying to redirect the daughter's hero status might be inappropriate. It's about the children's right to have their own opinions about their parents, even if the parents have issues. The author's role is to support the kids without undermining the other parent, especially given the legal and co-parenting context. So, the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
