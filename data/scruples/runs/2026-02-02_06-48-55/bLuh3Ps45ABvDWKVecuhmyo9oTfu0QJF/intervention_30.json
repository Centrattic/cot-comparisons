She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is a single dad who had a difficult time with his ex-wife. She has a history of jail, affairs, job issues, and now lives with her mom. The author has been taking care of the kids for three years, worked hard, even learned to braid hair. He remarried, and his new wife helps provide everything for the kids. They pay for healthcare, school, activities, projects, and even future expenses like a car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself and he's forgiven her.\n\nThen, when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero, he responds by pointing out that they provide for her, have her every day, and that it's easier to be a parent part-time. He's frustrated because the kids see their mom as an angel and don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is the stepfather who's providing a lot of support. The kids still have a relationship with their mom, even if she's not a great parent. The author's response to his daughter's question might come off as harsh or dismissive, even if his intentions are to set the record straight. The daughter was asking for advice on her answer, and he pointed out the facts about their mom's situation, which could make her feel conflicted or like she can't honor her mom without undermining the stepfather's efforts. \n\nBut he isn't actively badmouthing the mother. He's just pointing out the reality of her not being around and not contributing. However, the kids might still look at their mom in a positive light because they see her as their biological parent, especially when she's available and maybe more lenient. The author is trying to balance his role as a caring stepfather while also being honest about the mother's shortcomings. \n\nThe key issue here is whether it's wrong for him to express frustration about the kids idolizing their mom when he's the one providing the support. The ex-wife's behavior is clearly problematic, but the kids are still in a position to see her as a hero perhaps because they have a bond, even if it's not perfect. The author's response might be seen as undermining the mother's role, but he's not forbidding the daughter from choosing her mom. He's just highlighting the differences in their caregiving roles. \n\nIn the context of the situation, the author is not being cruel. He's stating facts about their living arrangements and support. However, the daughter is 8 years old, and the way he phrased it might be confusing or hurtful. But the main point is whether he's in the wrong for resenting the kids' perception. Since he's the one providing the bulk of the care and resources, it's reasonable for him to feel that the kids should recognize his efforts. At the same time, he's not forcing the daughter to not honor her mother; he's just explaining the differences. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) context is important here. The community often considers intent and impact. His intent was to clarify the situation, but the impact might be making the daughter feel like her mom is not a hero. However, the mother's actual behavior (jail, affairs, instability) might make it a valid point. The author isn't badmouthing her, just providing a realistic perspective. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong. He's being honest about the mother's lack of support and his own role. The kids can still have their own views, but it's the stepfather's right to feel that they should acknowledge his contributions without dismissing the mother outright.\n"
