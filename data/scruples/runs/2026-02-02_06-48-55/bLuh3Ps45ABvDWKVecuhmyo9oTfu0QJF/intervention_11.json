She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who is frustrated that his children see their mother, their ex-stepmom, as a hero despite her history of issues. The stepmom's current husband is providing for the kids financially and otherwise but feels unappreciated. The key event is when the daughter asks about choosing her biological mother as her hero, and the stepdad responds by pointing out the ex's shortcomings and their own sacrifices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother has a troubled past and isn't providing much support, yet the kids still idealize her. The stepdad is frustrated because he's covering all the costs and the kids don't seem to recognize that. His response to the daughter was to highlight the ex's failings and contrast it with their own efforts. \n\nThe question is whether that response is wrong. From a parenting perspective, it's important not to badmouth the other parent, even if they're not doing their part. The stepdad's intention might be to correct the daughter's skewed perception, but the method could be problematic. He's pointing out the ex's lack of support and the mother's benefits without chores. This could make the daughter feel conflicted or even resentful towards her mother, which might not be healthy. Also, the stepdad mentions he's forgiven the mother, so his tone might be more about his own frustration than the daughter's best interest.\n\nHowever, the stepdad is also trying to validate his own role and sacrifices. The daughter is getting mixed messages: she lives with the stepdad and stepmom, they pay for everything, yet she might feel drawn to her mother's less demanding environment. The stepdad's response could be seen as an attempt to help her see the reality of the situation, but it's done in a way that compares the two parents unfavorably. \n\nIn family counseling, it's often advised to avoid badmouthing the other parent to children, as it can create guilt or loyalty conflicts. The stepdad's approach might be well-intentioned, but the method is questionable. He's not directly discouraging her from choosing her mother but is pointing out the inconsistencies. However, by bringing up the mother's shortcomings, he's indirectly criticizing her, which could hurt the child's feelings or create tension.\n\nSo, considering all this, the stepdad is in the wrong (Answer A) because even though his frustration is understandable, the way he addressed the daughter's question was inappropriate. He should have focused on affirming his own role without denigrating the other parent, even if he believes the mother is less capable. The key is to model respect for all family members, even in the face of disagreement or dissatisfaction.\n"
