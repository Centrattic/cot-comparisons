She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for feeling resentful that their children view their ex-wife as a hero.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The ex-wife has a history of multiple issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The author was a single dad for three years, taking on a lot of responsibilities, including caring for his daughter by braiding her hair. He's remarried, and his new wife and he provide for the kids' needs: healthcare, school projects, activities, even buying a car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself, showing forgiveness.\n\nThen, the daughter asks if she should say her mom is her hero for a pageant. The author responds by pointing out that they provide for her, live with them, and that the mother only sees the kids every other weekend with no chores, implying that being a parent part-time is easier. He doesn't derogate the mother but expresses frustration.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his response was inappropriate. He's not directly criticizing the mother in front of the child, but he's expressing his feelings about the situation. He might be trying to make the child aware of the reality of their circumstances, but there's a risk that the child could take the message to not respect the mother, even if that's not his intent.\n\nHowever, he's also trying to ensure the child appreciates what he and his wife do. The line is thin here. In many cases, experts advise against making children choose between parents or undermining the other parent, even if the parent has issues. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might inadvertently harm the child's relationship with the mother. Even if he's not directly badmouthing her, the implication that the mother doesn't do as much could affect the child's perception.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons for feeling resentful given the mother's actions. He's doing a lot for the kids, and it's natural to feel undervalued. But the way he addressed the daughter's question might not be the best approach. Instead of explaining the contrast between the two parenting situations, it might be better to focus on the daughter's own relationship with each parent rather than comparing their efforts.\n\nSo, considering the potential impact on the child's view of both parents and the advice often given in such situations, the author might be in the wrong for his response, even if his intentions are good. The answer could lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. However, the options are A or B. Given that he didn't directly insult the mother but tried to explain the situation, maybe the answer is B (No). But the risk is that the child might internalize the comparison. Hmm. I think the consensus would be that the author is in the wrong because he's subtly undermining the mother even if he didn't intend to. So Answer A.\n"
