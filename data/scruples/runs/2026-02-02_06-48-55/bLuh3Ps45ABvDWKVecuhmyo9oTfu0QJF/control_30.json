She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a step-parent who's feeling resentful because the kids see their mother (the ex-wife) as a hero, even though she's been problematic. The step-parent has been providing a lot for the kids, while the mother has a history of issues.\n\nFirst, the step-parent's perspective: They've been the primary caregiver, paying for everything, supporting the kids' activities, healthcare, and even future plans like a car and braces. They don't take child support because the mother can't support herself. The step-parent feels frustrated that the kids idolize the mother despite her flaws.\n\nIn the specific incident, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should name her mother as a hero. The step-parent responds by pointing out that the mother is only in their lives a couple of weekends a month and that being a parent full-time is harder. The step-parent doesn't want to badmouth the mother but feels the kids don't appreciate their efforts.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a parenting perspective, the step-parent is trying to manage the child's expectations and highlight the reality of the mother's limited presence. However, they might be undermining the child's ability to form their own opinion. The key here is whether the step-parent overstepped by implying the mother isn't a good parent just because she's not present as much. \n\nChildren often idealize a parent who is perceived as more \"available\" or less strict, even if that parent isn't providing as much in terms of resources. The step-parent's frustration is valid because they're shouldering most of the responsibilities. But the way they addressed the daughter's question might come off as dismissive of the child's feelings or perspective. The step-parent didn't directly criticize the mother, but they did contrast their own role with the mother's, which could make the child feel conflicted or pressured to choose between parents.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The step-parent's efforts to explain the situation could be seen as trying to be honest, but they might not be considering the child's emotional need to have both parents in a positive light. The step-parent's approach might lead to the child feeling torn or confused. However, they also have a right to feel resentful if their contributions aren't recognized. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and how the child perceives the situation. If the step-parent's goal was to help the child understand the reality of the mother's role without being negative, then maybe it's okay. But if the child is just expressing her feelings towards her mother, the step-parent's response might be too critical. So, the step-parent is not necessarily in the wrong, but they need to be more sensitive to the child's emotional needs. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note about communication style.\n"
