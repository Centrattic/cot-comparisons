She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a stepfather, is upset that his children still see their biological mother as a hero despite her problematic behavior. He's taken care of the kids for three years as a single dad, and now he's remarried. His wife and he provide everything for the kids, but the kids still idolize the mother. The author expressed his frustration when his daughter asked if she should name her mother as her hero in a pageant.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author mentions that the ex-wife has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mother. The author and his wife are providing all for the children, even paying for expensive things like a car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself. When the daughter asks about naming her mother as a hero, the author responds by pointing out that the mother only sees them every other weekend and it's easier to be a parent part-time.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible issue here is that the author is trying to influence the child's perception of their mother. Even though he's frustrated, he's essentially comparing his own parenting (full-time, financially) to the mother's part-time involvement. However, the mother is their biological parent, and children often naturally look up to their parents regardless of the circumstances. The author might be projecting his resentment by pointing out the mother's lack of effort, which could be seen as undermining her in front of the child.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior. If she's not providing stability and has a history of being unreliable, the author's frustration is understandable. He's tried to be forgiving and not derogatory, but he's clearly upset that the kids don't acknowledge the stepmother's and his efforts. However, the children's perspective is important here. They might not be comparing the two parents because they see their mother as a parental figure regardless of the situation. The author might be in a position where he's trying to assert his role as a primary caregiver, but the way he's doing it could be seen as belittling the mother in front of the child, which is generally not advised.\n\nLegally, the mother still has parental rights, and the children have a biological connection to her. The author's response, while coming from a place of frustration, could be seen as trying to diminish the mother's role in the child's eyes. This might not be appropriate, as it could affect the child's relationship with both parents. Even if the mother isn't a good parent, the author shouldn't necessarily be the one to point that out to the child, especially in a situation where the child is trying to form their own opinions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in feeling unappreciated, especially since he's the one providing all the resources. But he's not the biological parent, so the children's attachment to their birth mother might be natural. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be problematic. It's a delicate balance between being a supportive stepfather and addressing the child's perception of their other parent.\n\nIn terms of whether he's \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a grey area. However, from a parenting perspective, it's generally advised not to badmouth the other parent in front of the children. The author's response, while trying to highlight his own contributions, could be damaging to the child's relationship with the mother. So even if the mother isn't a good parent, the author shouldn't undermine her in the child's eyes. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A) because he's interfering with the child's natural attachment, even if his feelings are valid. But some might argue that B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so problematic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and his actions here could be seen as crossing a line.\n"
