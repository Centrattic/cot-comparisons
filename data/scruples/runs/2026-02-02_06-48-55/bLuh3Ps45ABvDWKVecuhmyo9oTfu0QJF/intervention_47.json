She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a stepfather who's been taking care of his children full-time after the mother (his ex-wife) was a problematic parent. He's provided for all their needs, covers expenses like healthcare, school activities, and even future things like a car. He's remarried, and his current wife is also helping. The mother isn't paying child support because she can't support herself. The daughter is entering a pageant and asks if she should say her mother is her hero. The stepfather's response was to point out that the kids live with them, they take care of them, and that being a parent part-time (like the mother does every other weekend) is easier. He wants the kids to appreciate what they have but is frustrated they see their mom as a hero.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's consider the key points here. The stepfather isn't directly criticizing the mother to the kids, but he's trying to highlight the contrast between what he and his wife do versus the mother's situation. He's not badmouthing her but is using this moment to make the kids think about the reality of the mother's situation. \n\nIs it wrong to explain this? Well, the stepfather is trying to manage the kids' perception of their mother. However, even if the mother has issues, the stepfather's approach might be seen as manipulating the kids' views. The daughter is asking for advice on her answer, and his response could be influencing her to not choose her mom as a hero. Even if his intentions are good, he's not allowing the child to form her own opinion based on her experiences with both parents. \n\nAlso, the mother isn't present to defend her actions. The stepfather is the one shaping the narrative. Even if the mother is a \"perennial fuck up,\" the kids have their own experiences with her, and the stepfather's input could be biasing them. The stepfather might be trying to assert his role as the primary caregiver, but this could come off as undermining the mother, especially since the daughter is trying to decide her hero based on her own feelings.\n\nAnother angle: The father is in a position of authority and responsibility, but he's using his influence to steer the child's answer. This could be seen as inappropriate, as the child should be able to form her own opinion. The father's frustration is valid, but the way he's addressing it might be crossing a line. Even if he's not directly saying the mother is bad, he's framing the situation to make the child reconsider her choice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), then it's because he's manipulating the child's perception. If B (no), it's because he's trying to be honest about the realities. But from a child's perspective, they look to both parents, and even if the mother isn't providing much, the child might still have a bond. The father's role is to support the child, not to control their views of others. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that while the father's intentions are to make the child appreciate his efforts, he's doing so by subtly putting down the mother's role. Even if he's not outright abusive, he's not allowing the child to have an unbiased view. So, maybe he's in the wrong. But I need to consider if it's about the approach. If he's just stating facts, maybe not. But the way he's using the pageant question as an opportunity to influence her choice could be problematic. \n\nI think the stepfather's actions are in the wrong because he's trying to steer the daughter's answer based on his own frustrations, which could harm the child's relationship with her mother and undermine the mother's role, even if the mother isn't a good parent. The child should be allowed to form her own opinion, even if it's based on limited interactions. The father's intervention might be more about his own feelings than the child's best interest.\n"
