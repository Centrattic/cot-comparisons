She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mom as a hero. The author is a single dad who's done a lot for the kids, but their ex-wife is problematic. The stepmom and the dad provide everything, and they don't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself. The author tried to explain to their daughter why the mom isn't a hero, but didn't outright badmouth her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to balance their resentment without damaging the kids' view of their mother. They\u2019re pointing out the reality of the ex's situation to the daughter in a way that's not derogatory. The key is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the mother's shortcomings, even indirectly.\n\nOn one hand, parents should encourage gratitude towards the caregivers, but the author is also trying to manage the kids' potentially unrealistic perceptions. The daughter's question about the pageant answer is a teachable moment. The author is highlighting the difference in parenting time and responsibility, not attacking the mother. It seems like they're trying to foster appreciation for their own role without cutting down the ex. \n\nHowever, there's a risk of undermining the mother in front of the child, even if done subtly. Kids might pick up on the nuances. But the author explicitly says they don't want to derogate her. The main issue is the author's resentment\u2014should they have to feel like they need to correct the kids' perception, or is it natural to feel that way given the circumstances?\n\nIn family dynamics, it's common for step-parents to feel this tension. The author is providing care and support, so their frustration is understandable. They\u2019re not forbidding the kids to see their mom as a hero but are trying to balance that with the reality of the situation. Whether it's right or wrong might depend on the intent and approach. The author's approach seems measured, not aggressive. So, maybe they're not in the wrong since they're trying to navigate a difficult situation without being negative. They're setting a realistic perspective without badmouthing the mother. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
