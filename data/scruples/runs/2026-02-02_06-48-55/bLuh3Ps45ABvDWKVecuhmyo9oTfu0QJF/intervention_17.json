She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling resentful that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex has a troubled history\u2014jail, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The author was a single dad, now remarried, and they provide everything for the kids, including healthcare, activities, braces, a future car, etc. They don't ask for child support. The daughter is preparing for a pageant and considered naming her mom as her hero. The author responds by pointing out their contributions and the easier situation at the ex's place.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is resentment over the kids idolizing the ex. They feel their efforts are unappreciated. The ex's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author wants the kids to see the stepmom as their parent and not idolize the ex. However, in the moment with the daughter, the author is trying to redirect her focus, maybe to highlight their own contributions. But the author says they don't want to hurt the ex or derogate her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing frustration, but they didn't come out and badmouth the ex. Instead, they're trying to get the daughter to think about the context\u2014like the other weekends with fewer responsibilities. The author is trying to manage the kids' perceptions but in a way that's honest about their own situation. However, the daughter is still young, and the author's frustration might come across as dismissive of the daughter's feelings or the ex's role in her life, even if it's problematic. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their feelings in that way. \n\nThe ex's actions are harmful, but the author's response might be seen as trying to undermine the daughter's relationship with her biological mom. Even if the ex isn't a good role model, the daughter has a right to have a relationship with both parents. The author's approach might be seen as manipulative or emotionally manipulative to shift the daughter's hero from the ex to them. But the author is also providing for the kids and feels their efforts aren't recognized. It's a complex situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's frustration is understandable, but the way they addressed the daughter's question might not be the healthiest approach. By contrasting the two parent figures, the author might be fostering a negative view of the ex, even if it's true. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for that. Since the author didn't directly insult the ex but tried to make the daughter aware of the differences in parental roles, it's a gray area. However, the author's intention to prevent the daughter from idolizing the ex could be seen as appropriate if the ex's behavior is harmful. But the method might be questionable. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions cross into undermining the ex unjustly. Since the ex has a history of issues and the author is trying to protect the kids' well-being, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is trying to belittle the ex's role for personal reasons, that's different. The key points are the ex's actions, the author's good intentions in providing for the kids, and the approach taken in the conversation with the daughter. The author's response might be seen as valid if it's about the kids' best interest, but it's a close call. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
