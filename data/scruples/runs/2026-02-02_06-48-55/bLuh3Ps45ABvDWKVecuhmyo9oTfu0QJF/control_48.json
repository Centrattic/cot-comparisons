She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a stepmother who's dealing with her stepchildren idolizing their biological mother, who has a history of problematic behavior\u2014jail time, affairs, job instability, and currently lives with her mother. The author and her husband have been providing for the kids for three years as single parents, covering healthcare, activities, school projects, and future expenses like a car and braces. They don't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. The author says she's forgiven the ex but feels resentful that the kids see their mom as a hero. \n\nIn the recent incident, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responds by pointing out that the kids live with them full-time and they provide for everything, while their mom only sees them every other weekend. She mentions that being a parent part-time is easier than doing it full-time. The author doesn't want to badmouth the ex but is frustrated that the kids don't appreciate their stepmother and husband's efforts.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author is trying to manage her resentment without directly criticizing the ex, which seems fair. She's not saying the ex is bad, just explaining the reality of their living situations. However, the way she responds to the daughter might be problematic. She's implying that the ex isn't a good parent because she only sees the kids part-time and they don't have chores there, suggesting that the ex is easier on them. This could be seen as undermining the ex's parenting in front of the child, even if it's not direct. \n\nThe daughter is eight years old, and the author's response might make her question her mom's parenting or feel conflicted about her feelings. Even though the stepmother is trying to highlight her own efforts, comparing the two parents in this context could be harmful. The stepmother is in a position of authority and is the primary caregiver, so her comments might influence the child's perspective. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author hasn't asked for child support shows she's being generous, but that doesn't negate the fact that the ex isn't providing any financial support. However, the stepmother's frustration is valid because she's shouldering all the responsibility. The challenge is in how she addresses that frustration. Instead of explaining the differences in parenting situations, maybe she should be encouraging the daughter to consider who her hero is without judgment, or address her own feelings without comparing the two parents.\n\nThe key point here is that while the author's feelings are understandable, her response might be manipulative or subtly devaluing the ex's role as a parent. Even if it's not overtly negative, framing the ex's part-time parenting as easier could make the child feel like there's something wrong with their mom's approach. The stepmother should focus on her own role and let the child form their own opinions without being influenced by comparisons. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how she handled the situation, even if her intentions were to highlight her own contributions.\n"
