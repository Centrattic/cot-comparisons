She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a father who's a single dad and now remarried. He's providing for his kids, but the kids still admire their mother despite her being a \"perennial fuck up.\" The stepmom and stepdad do everything for the kids, but the kids still see the mother as a hero. The father is frustrated and had a conversation with his daughter about her pageant question, explaining that their stepmom takes care of them more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the father's feelings of resentment and how he expressed that to his daughter. He didn't directly criticize the mother, but he did highlight the stepmom's role and the mother's lack of support. The question is whether he's wrong for feeling this way and acting on it.\n\nFirst, it's important to consider the father's perspective. He's providing a lot of support and feels unappreciated. The mother isn't contributing financially and has a problematic history. The father's frustration is understandable. However, the way he expressed his feelings to his daughter might be problematic. He's trying to influence her answer to the pageant question by pointing out the mother's shortcomings compared to the stepmom's efforts. Even though he didn't directly criticize the mother, he did imply that the mother isn't doing as much, which could affect the daughter's perception.\n\nChildren often have a natural bias toward their biological parents, which can be hard for stepparents to deal with. The father might be trying to balance that by emphasizing the stepmom's contributions. But is it right to do so in a way that could undermine the mother's image? The father mentions he doesn't want to hurt the mother, but he's still trying to correct the daughter's view. This could lead to the daughter feeling conflicted or confused about her real mom.\n\nAlso, the father is in a position where he's trying to manage the relationship between the children and their mother, especially since visitation is every other weekend. The mother's current situation (food stamps, living with her mom) probably means she can't provide as much as the stepdad and stepmom. However, the kids might see their mother as more available and attentive during their visits, even if it's not as structured or supportive.\n\nThe father's approach might be seen as trying to manipulate the daughter's answer, which could come across as trying to rewrite the daughter's perception. Even if his intentions are good, he's imposing his views on her. The daughter's question was genuine, and the father's response might be more about his own feelings of being undervalued rather than the daughter's actual needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The father has valid feelings of being underappreciated, but the way he expressed them might not be fair to the daughter or the mother. He's trying to balance the scales, but perhaps in a way that's not entirely constructive. The answer depends on whether the method of expressing his feelings (highlighting the stepmom's efforts and the mother's lack thereof) is appropriate.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No), because the father is just trying to address his feelings of being overlooked, even if the method is a bit heavy-handed. He isn't directly attacking the mother but is pointing out the reality of the situation. However, others might argue he's in the wrong for trying to influence the daughter's perception. But given the context, B seems more accurate.\n"
