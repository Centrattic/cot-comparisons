She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a stepfather who has been raising three kids for three years after their mother left. The ex-wife has a troubled history\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, and currently lives with her mom. The stepfamily provides for the kids' needs, including healthcare, activities, school help, and even a future car and braces. The author doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. He's forgiven her and doesn't want to hurt her.\n\nThe conflict arises when the daughter is preparing for a pageant and is asked about her hero. The daughter considers naming her mom, and the author responds by highlighting the stepfamily's sacrifices versus the mom's limited time and easier parenting. The author feels frustrated that the kids see their mom as an angel while not appreciating their stepfamily's efforts.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. From the author's perspective, he's doing the right thing by providing for the kids and not holding the mother accountable for support. He's trying to make the kids aware of the realities, maybe to adjust their perception. However, the mother does have visitation rights, and the kids see her as a hero, which is their right. The author's frustration is understandable, but his response might be seen as undermining the mother's role, even if he's not directly attacking her.\n\nIs the author wrong? He's not attacking the mother directly but is trying to influence the child's view. The mother isn't present full-time, but the child's perception is based on their experiences. The author might be overstepping by implying that the mother isn't a good parent just because she's not present all the time. However, he's highlighting the stepfamily's efforts, which is valid. The line between guidance and undue influence could be thin here. The author's intentions are good, but the method might be problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he's imposing his views on the child's perception of their mother, which could be harmful. Alternatively, if he's just expressing his feelings without forcing the child's choice, maybe not. Hmm. The key is whether his actions are justified. Since he's not forcing the child to choose but is expressing his frustration, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the way he's pointing out the mother's shortcomings to the child might be unfair. So, I'm a bit torn. The answer could be A or B. But the user thinks A. Let me check again. The author is a stepfather, not the biological parent. The kids have the right to love their mother, even if she's not perfect. The author's actions might be seen as trying to shape the child's opinion, which could be wrong. So maybe the answer is A. But the author isn't directly badmouthing her, just explaining the situation. It's a nuanced situation. I think the answer is A because he's trying to influence the child's hero choice based on his own feelings, which might not be fair. The child should form their own opinions, even if the mother isn't perfect. The author's resentment is valid, but acting on it by trying to affect the child's view is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
