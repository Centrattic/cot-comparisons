She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a father who's been a single dad for three years, taking care of his three kids, and now he's remarried. His ex-wife is described as having multiple issues\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. He's providing everything for the kids, including healthcare, activities, school projects, and even planning to buy his son a car and pay for his daughter's braces. He doesn't ask for child support because he knows she can't support herself and he's forgiven her. However, when his daughter asks if she should say her mother is her hero for a pageant, he responds by pointing out that the children live with him and his wife full-time, get to see their mom every other weekend with no chores and food stamps, making it easier to be a parent part-time. He's frustrated that they see their mom as an angel despite all he and his wife do.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The father is clearly invested in his children's well-being, providing for them financially and emotionally. He's taken on the role of a single parent, learned new skills like braiding hair, and has a stepmom who's also contributing. The ex-wife, on the other hand, has a troubled history, which might affect her ability to be a consistent parent. The father is trying to manage his resentment without being negative towards the ex, but the daughter's question pushes him to respond.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the father's response was appropriate. He didn't directly criticize the ex-wife but pointed out the differences in their living situations. He emphasized the full-time effort he and his stepmom put in versus the ex's part-time involvement. The question is if he crossed a line by highlighting these differences to the children, possibly undermining the ex's role as a mom in their eyes.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, they might not understand the complexities of their parents' divorce and the ex-wife's circumstances. The father is trying to balance his feelings without being harsh, but his response could be seen as trying to influence the daughter's perception of her mother. Even though he didn't directly insult the ex, he's contrasting the efforts of his family versus hers, which might make the children feel conflicted.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have a duty to not disparage the other parent in front of the children, as it can harm the child's relationship with both parents. The father's approach might be seen as subtly undermining the ex, even if it's not overtly negative. He's trying to correct the daughter's perception, but by pointing out the differences in parenting styles and responsibilities, he's creating a comparison that could lead the child to question her mother's role.\n\nOn the other hand, the father has every right to feel frustrated. He's providing all the necessary support, and the children's visits with the ex are limited. The ex's inability to support herself might make it challenging for her to be an active parent. The father's intention is not to hurt the ex but to make the children aware of the reality of their living situations. However, discussing this with the children, especially in the context of a pageant question, might not be the best approach.\n\nThe daughter's question is innocent, but the father's response could be seen as manipulating the situation to get the child to choose sides, even if indirectly. While he's not outright badmouthing the ex, he's framing the comparison in a way that could make the child feel conflicted. The line between explaining reality and creating a negative perception is thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intentions are understandable, his method of addressing the daughter's question might be inappropriate. He should focus on supporting his children without undermining the ex's role, even if he disagrees with how the children perceive her. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's influencing the children's perception of their mother, even if subtly.\n"
