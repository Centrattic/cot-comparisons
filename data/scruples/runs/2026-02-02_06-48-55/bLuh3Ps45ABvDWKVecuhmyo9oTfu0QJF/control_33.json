She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who is a stepfather, raising three kids after their mother was an absent, problematic ex-wife. The stepfather is providing a lot of support, paying for everything, and he's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero despite her issues. The key moment is when his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should say her mom is her hero. The father responds by pointing out the stepfamily's contributions and the mother's lack of responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the father's actions. He didn't directly criticize the mother but highlighted the contrast between the two parents' roles. He's not badmouthing her, which is a good point. However, he's expressing his frustration by making the child aware of the mother's shortcomings. The question is whether this approach is wrong.\n\nLegally, the father isn't obligated to provide for the kids since he's remarried and the mother isn't paying child support. But morally, he's taking responsibility. The kids might still be influenced by their mother's behavior during visitations, which could be easier for her. The father's frustration is understandable, but how did he handle it? He didn't force the daughter to choose, but he explained the situation. It's possible that the daughter is still young and her perception is shaped by limited time with her mom.\n\nThe father's main issue is resentment over the kids' positive view of their mother despite her failures. The problem here is that he's trying to influence the child's answer by pointing out the mother's lack of effort. Even though he's not overtly negative, he's trying to correct the child's perspective, which could be seen as undermining the mother's role in the child's life. The mother does have custody on weekends, and the child might not see the mother's shortcomings firsthand.\n\nIs it the father's place to influence the child's answer about their hero? The child has the right to idolize their mother, especially if that's part of their emotional connection. The father's frustration is valid, but his approach might be seen as attempting to control the child's perception, which could be harmful. It's about balancing the child's right to maintain a relationship with both parents versus the father's need to feel appreciated. The answer hinges on whether the father's response was manipulative or just an honest conversation. Since he didn't force her to say something, but rather explained his viewpoint, it's in a gray area. However, using the situation to highlight his own family's efforts might be seen as wrong because it's trying to redirect the child's admiration.\n"
