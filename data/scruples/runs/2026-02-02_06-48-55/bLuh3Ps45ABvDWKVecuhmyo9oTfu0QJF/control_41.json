She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for resenting that his children see their mother as a hero, given her history of problems.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a single dad who took care of his kids for three years while the ex-wife had multiple issues. Now, he's remarried, and they provide for the kids financially and emotionally. The ex isn't supporting them financially. The daughter is preparing for a pageant and wants to name her mother as her hero. The step-parent responds by pointing out their own efforts and the ex's lack of responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are the step-parent's frustration and their reaction. They didn't directly criticize the mother but highlighted their own contributions and the ex's shortcomings. The question is whether this response is wrong.\n\nLegally, the ex might not be obligated to pay child support, but the step-parent isn't required to support the kids either. The ex's past actions (jail, affairs, etc.) might contribute to the step-parent's feelings. However, the step-parent's approach might be seen as trying to influence the child's perception, even if they didn't outright badmouth the mother.\n\nThe daughter is young, so her hero choice could be influenced by the limited time she spends with her mom, who gives her food and freedom, versus the step-parent's structured but demanding environment. The step-parent's explanation is factual but might come off as manipulative. They're expressing frustration, which is understandable, but how they express it could affect the child's view.\n\nIs the step-parent in the wrong? They haven't said anything untrue, but they are using the situation to highlight their efforts and the mother's lack of support. This could be seen as undermining the mother's image to the child, even if subtly. However, they're also trying to make the child aware of reality. The line here is between expressing valid concerns and trying to control the child's opinion. The step-parent's goal might be to ensure the child appreciates their sacrifices, but the method might be inappropriate. The answer hinges on whether manipulating the child's hero choice is wrong, even if done gently. If the step-parent's intention is to correct the child's skewed perception based on limited exposure, it could be justified. But if they're trying to belittle the mother, then it's wrong. The step-parent claims they don't want to hurt the ex, but they might be indirectly doing so by influencing the child. So, the answer is a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the step-parent not being in the wrong because their comments are based on facts and they're trying to provide context, even if it's a sensitive topic.\n"
