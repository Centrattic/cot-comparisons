She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who's a stepfather, having taken care of his children after their mother, his ex-wife, had a lot of issues. The stepfather feels resentful because the kids still see their mother as a hero despite her negative history. He didn't mention this to his children when asked about the pageant question, instead questioning their mom's role as a parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The stepfather has stepped in as a primary caregiver, providing for the kids' needs financially and emotionally. He's not asking for child support, which shows he might be trying to be forgiving. However, when the daughter asked about her hero, he responded by pointing out the mother's shortcomings and the stepfamily's efforts. The stepfather says he doesn't want to derogate the mother, but his response seems to be doing that.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The stepfather's frustration is understandable given the mother's history. But he's in a position where he's the primary caregiver now, and the kids are living with him. He has a responsibility to maintain a positive relationship with the kids, and their biological mother, even if she's not a good parent. The way he responded could make the kids feel that their feelings about their mother are invalid. He didn't outright insult her but highlighted the contrast between the stepfamily's efforts and the mother's lack of it. That can create tension between the stepfamily and the children, especially since the kids are with the mother every other weekend. \n\nAlso, the stepfather's approach might be seen as undermining the mother's image in the kids' eyes, which can lead to the kids feeling conflicted or choosing sides. Even though he claims not to want to hurt her, the method of expressing his frustration might not be the healthiest. It's important for the kids to have a balanced view of both parents, especially if they have contact with both. The stepfather's actions could inadvertently make the kids resent the stepfamily for being critical of the mother, even if she's problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the stepfather has done a lot for the kids. He's not asking for anything in return, which is commendable. His frustration is valid, but the way he's expressing it might not be appropriate. The right approach might be to address the issue in a way that doesn't involve the kids. For example, discussing with his wife how to handle the situation or even speaking privately with the ex about the children's perceptions, but not using the kids as a medium to air his grievances.\n\nSo, considering all this, the stepfather's actions might be in the wrong because he's using the kids to convey his feelings about their mother. Even if his intentions are to correct their skewed perception, it's not the kids' role to mediate that. The correct answer here would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
