She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author of the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mother as a hero. The author is a stepdad who's taken full responsibility for the kids, providing everything, while the ex-wife is described as having a problematic history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is expressing frustration because the kids idealize their mother despite her issues. The author tried to explain the situation to his daughter, pointing out the contrast between their full-time support and the mother's limited involvement. He's not badmouthing her, just trying to help the child understand reality.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's not directly insulting the mother. He's being honest about the support they provide. However, kids often idealize a parent they don't live with, especially if they get more attention during visits. The author might be projecting his own feelings onto the child, expecting her to see things his way. \n\nAlso, the author is a stepdad, and the children's relationship with their biological mother is natural. The stepdad's role is supportive, and while he's doing a lot, the kids might still have a bond with their mother. It's possible he's trying to redirect the child's hero status to himself and his wife, which might not be fair to the child's emotional ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions (jail, affairs, etc.) are problematic, and the stepdad is trying to instill a sense of reality. But should he be the one to do that? Maybe the child is just forming her own opinions, and the stepdad's reaction is more about his own resentment than the child's answer. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's not outright badmouthing the mother, but he's expressing his frustration. The key point is whether he's justified in resenting the children's perception. While his actions are understandable, the child's perspective is valid too. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to be honest without being malicious, but there's a nuanced view here.\n"
