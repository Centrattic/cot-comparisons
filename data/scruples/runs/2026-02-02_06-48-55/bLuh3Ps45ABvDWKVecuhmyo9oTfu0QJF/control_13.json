She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) feeling resentful that their children see their mother (the ex-wife) as a hero, despite the ex's problematic behavior. The author has been a single dad for three years, took care of the kids, and now remarried. They provide everything for the children, even though the ex is struggling. The issue came up when the daughter was preparing for a pageant and asked if she should say her mom is her hero. The author responded by pointing out the contrast between the ex's limited parenting and their own efforts.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing frustration and explaining the situation to the daughter. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't directly insulted the ex. They're trying to explain the reality to the child, maybe to help her understand the difference in parenting roles. But the children still visit their mom, and the mother is doing her best given her circumstances. The author's response might be seen as undermining the mother's role, even if they're not actively badmouthing her. The children's perception is influenced by their time with each parent. The author might be trying to balance the child's admiration for the mother by highlighting their own contributions. However, the daughter is young, and the author's frustration could affect her view of the mother, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in feeling that their efforts are overlooked. They've taken on a lot and are providing for the kids. On the other hand, the children's relationship with their biological mother is important, and the author's response could be seen as trying to shift the child's perception. Even if the author isn't directly negative, pointing out the mother's shortcomings (like using food stamps, lack of chores) might be considered biased, especially since the mother isn't present to defend herself. The children might pick up on that and feel conflicted.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach is appropriate in guiding the child's answer. The author is trying to correct the child's perspective based on their own experiences. However, the child's feelings towards her mother might be legitimate, as she spends time with her and forms her own opinions. The author's frustration is valid, but the way it's expressed could be problematic. The answer likely depends on whether the author overstepped by critiquing the mother's parenting during a personal moment with the child. Since the author didn't outright insult the mother but tried to explain the situation, it's a gray area. However, because the author is the step-parent and the children's relationship with their birth mother is a sensitive topic, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for trying to influence the child's perception, even if with good intentions.\n"
