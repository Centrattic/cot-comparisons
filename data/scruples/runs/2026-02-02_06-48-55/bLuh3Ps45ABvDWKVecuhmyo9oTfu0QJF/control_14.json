She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for resenting that their kids see their mom as a hero, given the mother's problematic history.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The stepdad has been a single parent for three years, taking care of three kids, remarried, and provides everything. He's paying for healthcare, activities, braces, etc., and doesn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself. He's even forgiving her past issues like jail, affairs, job losses, and living with her mom. \n\nThen, the daughter is preparing for a pageant and wants to name her mom as a hero. The stepdad responds by pointing out the mother's lack of support and the stepdad's own sacrifices, but he's trying not to badmouth her. He's frustrated that the kids don't appreciate what they have with him and his wife.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's providing for the kids, and it's reasonable to feel resentful if they don't recognize his efforts. But on the other hand, he's not directly criticizing the mother but is highlighting the reality of her situation. However, he's still influencing the child's perspective by pointing out the mother's shortcomings during a conversation about the pageant question. \n\nBut the key here is that he's not actively denigrating her; he's just giving the child information to consider. The mother has a history of not being there, and the stepdad is trying to make the child aware of the context. The daughter might not have the full picture since she only sees the mother every other weekend. \n\nIs it wrong to express frustration in this situation? Maybe he's entitled to his feelings, as he's the one providing for the kids. However, the way he's approaching it might be a problem if it's undermining the mother's role. But since he's not directly criticizing her but explaining the reality, maybe it's not wrong. \n\nAlso, the mother's actions (using food stamps, not contributing) might justify the stepdad's perspective. The daughter might be naive in idolizing the mother without understanding the mother's limitations. So, the stepdad is trying to balance the child's view without being negative, which could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and providing context without directly belittling the mother, even though the situation is complex.\n"
