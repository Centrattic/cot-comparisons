She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex-wife has a history of issues: jail, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The author stepped in as a single dad, learned to care for his daughter, remarried, and now they provide everything for the kids. They pay for healthcare, activities, and even the car for the son. The ex can't support herself, so the author doesn't ask for child support. He's forgiven her but is frustrated when the daughter questions mentioning the ex as a hero. The author's response points out the reality that the ex doesn't provide as much as they do, but he avoids being derogatory.\n\nThe key here is the author's intent. He's not directly belittling the ex but is trying to explain the situation to his daughter. He wants the kids to appreciate what he and his wife do, which is understandable given the circumstances. However, he's concerned about their skewed perception of the ex. The daughter is in a position where she might be influenced by the ex's easier parenting during visits, which could affect her view of her mother as a hero. The author is trying to correct that by highlighting the actual contributions they make.\n\nBut is this the right approach? The author is trying to manage the child's perception without directly attacking the ex. He's providing a rationale for why they should consider his input. However, there's a risk of the child feeling pressured or conflicted. But given the ex's shortcomings and the author's dedication, his frustration is valid. He's not forcing the daughter to say anything, just explaining the situation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. The author is advocating for his own family's contributions and trying to balance the child's perspective. Since he's not being malicious but is addressing a real issue (the ex's inability to provide), his actions aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No), as he's not in the wrong.\n"
