She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for resenting that their children see their ex-wife as a hero. The ex-wife has a history of issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The writer is a stepfather who's been a single dad for three years, handling everything from childcare to paying for activities, healthcare, and future expenses like a car and braces. He doesn't ask for child support because the ex can't support herself. \n\nTonight, his daughter is preparing for a pageant and asks if she should list her mom as a hero. The stepfather responds by pointing out that they provide everything, she lives with them full-time, and that being a parent part-time (every other weekend) is easier than full-time. He doesn't want to hurt the ex's image but feels frustrated.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider the stepfather's perspective. He's invested a lot into the kids' lives, providing for their needs, and feels unappreciated. It's understandable to feel frustrated when the kids idealize the mother despite her shortcomings. However, the way he responded to the daughter might be problematic. He's essentially trying to influence her to not choose her mother as a hero, highlighting the mother's shortcomings and the stepfamily's sacrifices. That could come off as manipulative or undermining the mother, even if he's not directly negative. \n\nBut he does mention he hasn't derogated her and wants to keep the mother's image positive. However, his frustration is valid. The ex is getting credit for being a mom without the responsibility, and the kids see her as a hero despite her issues. The stepfather's role is crucial, but kids often idealize their birth parents regardless of circumstances, which can be painful for step-parents. \n\nOn the other hand, the stepfather's response might be seen as trying to control the child's perception. Even if his intentions are good, he's possibly making the child feel guilty about her feelings towards her biological mother. It's a delicate situation where the child is caught in the middle. The stepfather might not realize that the child's view of her mother isn't fully informed by the stepfather's efforts. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether the stepfather crossed a line. He didn't attack the mother directly but pointed out the realities of the situation. However, using the child's choice in a pageant as a way to subtly influence her could be seen as wrong. The child's well-being and the stepfather's need to express his feelings are both important. It's a tricky balance. \n\nI think the author's frustration is understandable, but the way he handled the situation might be inconsiderate. He should focus on expressing his feelings without trying to sway the child's opinion. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, according to the AITA framework, sometimes people are considered wrong if they're being manipulative or not respecting the child's perspective. So, the answer could be A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that he didn't directly attack the mother but tried to influence the child's choice, it's a close call. I might lean towards A because he's trying to control the child's hero choice, which isn't the child's fault, but the underlying frustration is valid. However, in the context of the question, the user thinks he's wrong. I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
