She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's resentful that his kids see their ex-mother as a hero, despite her problematic behaviors. He's a single dad now, remarried, and provides for the kids financially and emotionally. He's frustrated because the kids still idolize their mom, who has a history of jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom.\n\nThe key point is the father's response to his daughter's question about who to name as a hero in a pageant. He tells her that their stepmom and he take care of them, implying that their real mom isn't doing as much. He doesn't directly attack the ex-wife but points out the contrast in responsibilities and support.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The father is trying to make the kids aware of the stepmom's and his own contributions. However, he's not directly criticizing the mother, but he's highlighting the differences in how each parent is involved. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, he has a right to feel frustrated. He's providing for the kids while the ex isn't contributing. He's not badmouthing her, just stating facts about their living situations. On the other hand, the kids might be caught in the middle. The mother's time with them, though limited, might still be more appealing because she doesn't enforce chores or have the same structure. \n\nThe father's approach might be seen as trying to influence the kids' perception, even if indirectly. However, he's not outright lying or belittling their mother. He's pointing out the reality of their living arrangements. The stepmom is providing the care, so it's fair for the kids to recognize that. But the daughter is conflicted, seeing both parents in different lights.\n\nThe father's main issue is resentment, which he's expressing through a conversation with his daughter. He's not attacking the mother directly, but he's trying to make the daughter aware of the stepmom's role. Whether this is wrong depends on the approach. If he's trying to undermine the mother without valid reason, that's an issue. But here, he's stating facts about support and responsibilities. \n\nThe fact that he's not badmouthing her and is trying to be fair suggests he's not in the wrong. The problem might be the kids' exposure to their mother's behavior during visits, which the father can't control. Since he's being honest about the contributions he and the stepmom make, without attacking the ex-wife, it's more about the kids' natural inclination to admire the parent who's present during visits without the same demands. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong). He's addressing the reality of the situation without being malicious. The kids might still choose their mother as a hero due to the dynamics of visitation, but the father's intentions are valid.\n"
