She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a stepfather who's taking care of his kids, providing everything they need, and he's frustrated that his children see their biological mother as a hero, despite her history of issues. The stepfather didn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself, and he's just expressing his frustration when his daughter asks about choosing her mother as a hero in a pageant.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the stepfather is doing a lot for the kids, but they still look up to their mom, who has a problematic history. When the daughter asks if she should name her mother as a hero, the stepfather responds by pointing out that he and his wife are the ones providing for them and that being a parent part-time is easier. He's not trying to badmouth the mother but is frustrated.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, it's important to consider the dynamics here. The ex-wife is their biological mother, and kids often have a natural inclination to idealize their parents, even if the parent isn't perfect. The stepfather's frustration is understandable, especially since he's taking on a lot of responsibility. However, the way he responded to his daughter might be problematic. He's trying to make her aware of the other parent's shortcomings, which could influence her decision. But he's not directly putting down the mother; he's more highlighting the reality of the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the stepfather is being honest about the challenges of being a full-time parent and the support he and his wife provide. On the other hand, he might be trying to shift the daughter's perspective, which could be seen as undermining the mother's role, even if indirectly. However, since he's not outright derogatory and has forgiven the mother, his intentions might be more about fairness than malice.\n\nThe daughter is in a position where she has two caregivers, but one is her biological parent. It's possible that the daughter feels torn between the two, especially since the mother isn't providing the same level of support. The stepfather's response could be seen as valid in pointing out the effort they put in, but he might need to consider how to balance that without making the daughter feel guilty for her feelings.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's expressing his feelings and trying to make his daughter aware of the situation, which is understandable. However, the daughter might not be ready to grasp all that, and the stepfather's frustration might come across as trying to influence her choice. But since he's not doing it in a malicious way and is providing for the kids, it's more about the complexity of blended families rather than being in the wrong. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because he's acting from a place of frustration and wanting his contributions to be recognized, not out of spite.\n"
