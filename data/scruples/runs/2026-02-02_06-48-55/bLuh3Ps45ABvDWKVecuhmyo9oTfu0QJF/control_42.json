She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for resenting that his kids see their mom as a hero. The situation involves a divorced couple where the mother has a problematic history\u2014jail time, affairs, job losses, living with her mom. The father was a single dad for three years, now remarried, taking care of the kids fully, providing everything. He doesn't ask for child support because the mom can't support herself. He's forgiven her but feels frustrated when the kids still view their mom positively.\n\nIn the specific incident, the daughter is entering a pageant and asks if she should name her mom as her hero. The father responds by pointing out that they provide for her, take care of her daily, and that the mom only sees the kids every other weekend with easier parenting. He didn't directly criticize the mom but tried to make the daughter aware of the stepfamily's efforts.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The father is not badmouthing the mother but is expressing his feelings of being taken for granted. He's concerned about the kids appreciating what he and his wife do. However, he is the one providing all the support, and the mother isn't contributing. \n\nThe daughter's question is about choosing a hero, which is a personal choice. The father's response might be seen as trying to influence her perception, but he didn't attack the mother directly. He's highlighting the contrast in their living situations and the amount of care they receive from him and his wife versus the mother. \n\nIs it wrong to feel resentful in this situation? Well, resentment is a natural emotion when someone feels unappreciated. The father isn't acting out of malice but frustration. The mother's actions (not supporting herself, previous issues) might contribute to the kids' perception. \n\nBut the father's role is to model forgiveness and not to belittle the other parent. However, he's not badmouthing her; he's just pointing out the facts of their living situation. The daughter is old enough to understand these dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids should have the right to have a positive view of their birth mother if they choose, even if she's not a good parent. The father's frustration is valid, but is his response appropriate? He's not telling the daughter to hate her mom, just reminding her of the reality. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the father isn't doing something unethical like slandering the mother. He's expressing his feelings and the situation as he sees it. The core issue is the daughter's choice in a hero, which is subjective. The father's response is more about the daughter recognizing the stepfamily's efforts rather than invalidating the mom's role entirely. \n\nTherefore, the father isn't in the wrong. He's managing his own feelings and trying to ensure his stepfamily's contributions are acknowledged. The answer would be B (No).\n"
