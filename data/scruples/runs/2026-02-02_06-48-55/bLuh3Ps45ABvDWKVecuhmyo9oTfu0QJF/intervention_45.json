She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for resenting that their children see their mother (the ex-wife) as a hero. The situation is complex, involving a difficult divorce, the ex-wife's history of issues, and the current stepmother and stepfather stepping in to take care of the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a stepfather who has taken on the role of a full-time parent, providing financial and emotional support. The ex-wife has a problematic history, but the kids still see her as a hero. The author's frustration stems from feeling unappreciated, especially since they are the ones providing the majority of care and resources. The specific incident is when the daughter asks if she should name her mother as her hero in a pageant, and the author responds by pointing out the ex's limited involvement and the stepfamily's efforts.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author might feel justified in their frustration given the ex-wife's behavior and their own sacrifices. On the other hand, the author's response to the daughter could be seen as undermining the mother in front of the child, even if indirectly. It's important to consider the impact on the child's perception of both parents.\n\nFamily dynamics post-divorce are tricky. The stepfather's role is crucial, but he's also stepping into a role that's already complex. The ex-wife, despite her flaws, is still the biological mother, and the children might have a natural inclination to view her more favorably, especially if she's more permissive. However, the author's response to the daughter's question might come across as dismissive of the mother's role, which could confuse the child or create loyalty conflicts.\n\nThe author's intention wasn't to belittle the mother, but the way he expressed his feelings might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the daughter is comparing different parenting styles, finding the mother's more relaxed approach appealing, even if it's not in the best interest in the long term. The stepfather's frustration is valid, but how he addresses it matters.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key issue is whether the author's approach was appropriate. While his feelings are understandable, using the moment to highlight the mother's shortcomings might not be the healthiest way to handle it. The children need to feel they can have a positive relationship with both parents without pressure. The author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more diplomatically, even if his frustration is justified. The right approach would be to acknowledge the daughter's feelings without putting down the mother, perhaps guiding her to appreciate the different roles each parent plays without creating conflict.\n"
