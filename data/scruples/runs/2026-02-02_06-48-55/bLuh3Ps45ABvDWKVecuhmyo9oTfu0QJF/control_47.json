She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe user is a man who's divorced and has three kids. Their mom, the ex-wife, has a lot of issues: jail time, affairs, job losses, and lives with her mom. The user was a single dad for three years, then remarried. He and his wife take care of the kids, providing healthcare, school help, activities, etc. He doesn't ask for child support because she can't support herself. He's forgiven her.\n\nNow, the daughter is entering a pageant and asks if she should say her mom (the ex) is her hero. The user responds by pointing out that they (he and his wife) provide for the kids full-time, and that seeing the ex as a hero is frustrating. He doesn't want to hurt her image but is upset they don't appreciate what they do.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is wrong for feeling this way and responding that way. \n\nFirst, let me consider the dynamics here. The user is the stepfather, and the kids live with him and his wife full-time. The ex has limited visitation (every other weekend), and the user is covering all the expenses. The ex's behavior has been problematic, but he's chosen not to hold her accountable by not asking for child support, which shows some level of forgiveness or leniency.\n\nThe daughter's question is about choosing a hero, and the user's response is to point out the discrepancies between the two parents. He's trying to highlight the effort they put in versus the ex's lack of responsibility. However, he's not directly criticizing the ex, just explaining the situation.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's natural to want the kids to appreciate the support they provide. However, the user is the stepfather, and the kids' relationship with their biological mother might still be influenced by their time with her. The user's frustration is valid because the ex's inconsistent parenting might make her seem easier, hence the \"angel\" perception.\n\nBut is pointing this out to the daughter wrong? The user didn't attack the ex directly but explained the reality. However, he's in a position where he's the stepfather, and the kids are legally his ex's responsibility. Even though he's providing care, the kids might still have an emotional bond with their mother. The user's response might be seen as trying to undermine that bond, which could be harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to balance the kids' perception and ensure they understand the effort he and his wife put into their care. It's a delicate situation because the kids have a right to love both parents, but the user might be feeling undervalued.\n\nI need to consider if the user's response is appropriate. He didn't insult the ex, but he's trying to influence the daughter's opinion. The daughter is young (8 years old), but in the example, the daughter is entering a pageant, so maybe she's older. Wait, the daughter is 8, but the son is 16. Wait, the daughter is 8, so she's entering a pageant\u2014maybe that's a typo? Anyway, the key point is that the user is expressing frustration that the kids see the ex as a hero despite the ex's issues.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the user's actions might be seen as trying to manipulate the kids' perceptions, which could be harmful. However, he's also in a position where he's providing all the support and might feel overlooked. The question is whether his response was appropriate. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether it's right to compare the two parents in front of the child, even indirectly. The user's response is more of a factual comparison rather than an emotional attack. But kids can pick up on these things, and it's possible that the user is trying to shift the daughter's loyalty. \n\nBut he's also their stepfather, and the kids are under his care. He has a right to feel frustrated. However, it's not his role to compare himself to the ex. The daughter is choosing a hero, and it's her right to choose her mother, even if the mother isn't perfect. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If he's trying to correct her perception by pointing out the other parent's lack of effort, is that wrong? Or is it understandable for him to want the child to appreciate the support they receive from him and his wife?\n\nI think it's a bit of both. But in terms of right or wrong, the user's response might be seen as justified in his feelings, but the way he expressed it could be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not attacking the ex directly but trying to explain the reality, perhaps it's not wrong. But if the daughter's choice is her own, then maybe he's overstepping by influencing her. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's just stating facts about the situation. The daughter is old enough to understand, and the user is providing context. However, the daughter might not be ready for that level of comparison. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the user's frustration is valid. On the other, he's in a position of authority and might be overstepping by trying to influence the child's hero choice. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer is A (yes, in the wrong), it's because he's undermining the ex-mother's role. If it's B (no), it's because he's just stating facts and trying to balance the child's perception.\n\nI think the key here is that the user is not directly attacking the ex but is trying to help the daughter understand the context. Since he's the one providing the care, he might feel it's important for the daughter to recognize that. However, it's a sensitive issue. The daughter has the right to have a relationship with her mom, even if she's not perfect. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), because he's expressing his feelings and providing facts without attacking the ex. However, the appropriateness of his approach is debatable. But according to the question, the options are A or B, not a nuanced answer. Given that, I think the user is not in the wrong because he's not doing anything harmful like attacking the ex, just explaining the situation.\n"
