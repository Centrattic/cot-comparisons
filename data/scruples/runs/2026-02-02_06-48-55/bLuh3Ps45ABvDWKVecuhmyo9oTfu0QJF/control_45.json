She\u2019s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I\u2019ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I\u2019ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can\u2019t even support herself. I don\u2019t wish to hurt her. In fact, I\u2019ve forgiven her for who she is and what she\u2019s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We\u2019ve paid for the dress. We\u2019ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, \u201cWho is your hero and why?\u201d \nMy daughter says, \u201cDo you think I should say, \u2018my mom?\u2019\u201d\nI said, \u201c You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom\u2019s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it\u2019s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It\u2019s harder to be a parent all the time.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never derogated their mother. I don\u2019t want to cripple their image of her, but it\u2019s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don\u2019t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a stepfather who's taking care of his three children full-time. His ex-wife has a history of legal issues, affairs, job instability, and currently lives with her mom. He's been a single dad for three years, learning to braid hair, etc. Now he's remarried, and his wife and he provide for the kids: healthcare, school help, activities, future car for the son, braces for the daughter. He doesn't ask for child support because the mother can't support herself. He's forgiven her and doesn't want to hurt her. \n\nThe daughter is entering a pageant where she's asked about her hero. She asks if she should say \"my mom.\" The author responds by pointing out that they provide everything, take care of her, and that the mom only sees the kids every other weekend with no chores, and she uses food stamps. He's frustrated that the kids see their mom as a hero and don't appreciate what he and his wife do.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? AITA?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not the biological father, which adds complexity. He's taken on a significant role in the kids' lives, but he's not their parent biologically. The mother, while having a troubled history, is the biological parent. The kids see her as a hero despite her shortcomings.\n\nThe author's response to the daughter's question is direct, pointing out the practical realities. However, he's trying to influence her perception of her mother. Even though he's being honest, he's a stepfather and might not be the one to dictate the mother's image in the child's eyes. The mother has legal rights and a biological bond, even if she's not as involved.\n\nHe didn't want to hurt her, but by questioning the daughter's choice, he's indirectly criticizing the mother. He's also highlighting the mother's lack of responsibility compared to his own. The daughter's question is about who she should choose as a hero, and he's steering her towards seeing the reality, not just what's convenient.\n\nBut is that his role? As a stepfather, he's in a position where he needs to support the kids' relationship with their biological parent unless there's abuse or neglect. Since the mother is allowed visitation and the kids see her as a hero, maybe the author is overstepping by trying to influence that perception. He's not the parent, he's the caregiver.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's never derogated the mother, but his response is critical of her parenting style and situation. The daughter is old enough to have her own opinions, and the author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be too direct. He might need to model appreciation for the mother's efforts, even if he disagrees with her actions.\n\nIn terms of the children's well-being, it's important for them to have a positive relationship with both parents, even if one is not the biological father. Unless the mother is harmful, the stepfather should encourage that bond rather than undermine it, even if he's frustrated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's trying to influence the daughter's perception of her mother instead of respecting the biological parent's role. He's justified in his frustration but shouldn't be the one to dictate who the daughter's hero is. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not the mother and shouldn't be undermining her in front of the child, even if his intentions are to highlight reality.\n"
