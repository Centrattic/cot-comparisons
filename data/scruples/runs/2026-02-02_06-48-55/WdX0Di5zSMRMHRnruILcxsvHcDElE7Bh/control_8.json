We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship after finding out his girlfriend cheated on her ex. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: the girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) with Guy B for three years after a breakup, then got back with Guy A before finally breaking up with him. She's now in a relationship with the author. He's upset because he values fidelity and can't accept her past infidelity, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on. He's considering ending things.\n\nNow, the ethical analysis. The author isn't the one who was cheated on, so does he have a right to be upset? Well, in a current relationship, honesty and trust are important. The girlfriend was open about her past, but the author feels betrayed upon learning the details. He's a man who values fidelity, which is a valid personal boundary. However, the cheating occurred in a past relationship, not with him. \n\nBut here's the catch: in their current relationship, they've emphasized the importance of honesty. If she had concealed this information, that could be a different issue. However, she came forward and confessed, which shows she's being honest now. The author is upset because he can't accept her past behavior, even if it's in the past. The question is whether his reaction is justified. \n\nEthically, people have the right to set boundaries based on their values. If the author can't get over her past actions, even though they don't directly affect him, it's his prerogative to reassess the relationship. However, some might argue that holding past mistakes from a previous relationship against her is unfair, especially since she's being honest now. But others might support his decision because he's prioritizing his values of trust and fidelity.\n\nThe key factors here are: 1) The infidelity happened in the past, not in their current relationship. 2) The girlfriend is being transparent now. 3) The author's inability to accept her past is causing him to consider ending the relationship. \n\nIn ethical terms, it's about personal values versus the reality of past actions. Since the author isn't the one who was wronged in the previous relationship, his decision to end things might be seen as based on his personal boundaries rather than wrongdoing on her part in their current relationship. However, if the author's main issue is the lack of trust or the nature of her past behavior, that's his issue to work through. But if he can't move past it, he's within his rights to prioritize his needs. \n\nSo, technically, is he in the wrong? If he's choosing to end the relationship because he can't accept her past (which she's honest about), he isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's acting on his values. However, some might argue that it's unfair to hold past relationships against her if they don't affect the current one. But given the context, the author is not the one she cheated on, so his decision is about his comfort and values in the current relationship. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for choosing to end things based on his inability to accept her past.\n"
