We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who's in a relationship with his current girlfriend, and he found out she cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with her previous co-worker (Guy B). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. She was with Guy A for three years, found out he cheated, broke up, then dated Guy B briefly, broke up with him because she felt he wasn't invested and she still loved Guy A. Then she got back with Guy A, they lasted another three years, he proposed, but she left him after a year because he wasn't committed. Now, she's with the author here.\n\nThe key issue is that after breaking up with Guy B, she continued having sex with him while still in a relationship with Guy A. She did this for three years as a form of revenge because Guy A cheated on her. Now the author is conflicted about whether to end the relationship because he values fidelity, even though she didn't cheat on him.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually asks if the person is at fault in the situation. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept his girlfriend's past cheating, even though it was with an ex. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally seen as wrong, but it's in the past and she confessed. The author is upset because he values fidelity, but he wasn't the one she cheated on. However, he's now in a relationship with her and feels betrayed by her past actions. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. If he can't get over her past, maybe he's being reasonable in seeking someone who values fidelity. On the other hand, some might argue that he's being too harsh because she's already confessed and they aren't the ones she cheated on. \n\nBut the fact that she cheated for three years, even as revenge, might make the author justified in his decision. Since he values fidelity, and she has a history of not being faithful in a past relationship, he might feel it's a dealbreaker. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out if they're being unreasonable. Here, the author is honest about his values and is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past. Since she's the one who cheated, the author isn't at fault for being hurt or wanting to end things. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
