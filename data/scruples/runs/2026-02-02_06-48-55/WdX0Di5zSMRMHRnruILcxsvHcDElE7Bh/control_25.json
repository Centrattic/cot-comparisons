We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the writer is in a current relationship with their girlfriend. They've been open about past relationships and both value honesty. Her story about her ex is that she had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then broke up because he cheated. She had a brief fling with Guy B, broke it off because she still loved Guy A, got back with him for another three years, and eventually broke up again. Now, the twist is that after breaking up with Guy B, she continued to have a sexual relationship with him for three years, getting back at Guy A for cheating. She only stopped when Guy A proposed, and then she ended things with him again. Now the writer is upset about this because he values fidelity and is considering ending their current relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the writer is in the wrong. The key point here is whether the current girlfriend cheated on her ex, not on the current partner. The writer is not the one she cheated on. The user is asking if the writer is wrong for being upset about this past infidelity.\n\nThe writer is considering ending the relationship because they can't accept that she cheated on her ex. But since the cheating was in the past and not involving the current partner, is the writer justified in ending the relationship? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people might have different opinions. Some might say that cheating on a past partner doesn't affect the current relationship, so the writer is overreacting. Others might argue that if someone is not capable of fidelity in past relationships, it could indicate issues in future relationships. However, since the current partner wasn't involved, the writer isn't technically wrong for being upset, but they might be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on someone else's past actions.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the writer) is in the wrong. The situation is complicated by the fact that the girlfriend was honest and confessed. The writer is reassessing the relationship, which is their right. However, the cheating was in the past and not against the current partner. So, the answer might depend on whether the writer's reaction is reasonable.\n\nIn some views, the writer isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be with someone who has issues with fidelity, even if it was in the past. But others might say that since the current partner isn't the one she cheated on, the writer is being unfair. However, given the writer's emphasis on fidelity and their belief that they wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance, it's their personal choice to decide their standards for a relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the writer isn't in the wrong for being upset about her past actions, especially since they value honesty and fidelity. The cheating was in the past, but it's affecting their current relationship, so it's their decision to reassess. They aren't wrong for choosing to end things if they feel they can't trust her or accept her past actions.\n"
