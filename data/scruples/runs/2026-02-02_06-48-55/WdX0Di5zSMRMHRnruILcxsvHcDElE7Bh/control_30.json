We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) with another guy (Guy B) over three years. The author is upset about this and considering breaking up because of it, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend was in a past relationship with Guy A, who cheated on her. She broke up with him, then briefly dated Guy B but ended that because she still had feelings for Guy A. Then she got back with Guy A, and during that time, she cheated on him with Guy B again for three years. Now, the author is her current boyfriend and found out about this past infidelity.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He values fidelity and feels that he wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance if he had known. He's considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that his girlfriend cheated on her ex, even though it's in the past. The main question is whether the author is at fault for wanting to end the relationship over this.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Cheating is generally considered a serious betrayal. Even if it's in the past, some people might find it hard to move past. The girlfriend confessed willingly, which is a good sign, but the author is still struggling with it. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not accepting her past actions.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if someone has cheated in a past relationship, does that disqualify them from being in a future relationship with someone else? Not necessarily. People can grow and change, and past mistakes don't always define a person. However, the author's feelings are valid because he values fidelity highly. It's his right to decide what he can and cannot accept in a partner. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were part of her past. She was in a different relationship situation, and she made a choice that she now regrets. She's owning up to it and being honest. The author's issue is with her past behavior, not with him personally. But he's considering ending the current relationship because of her past actions, which some might argue isn't his fault since he's not the one who was cheated on. However, others might say that it's reasonable for him to have boundaries about fidelity, even in a previous relationship.\n\nThe problem is that the author is not the one who was wronged in the past infidelity. He's the current partner, and he's reacting to her past. So, is it fair for him to hold that against her? It depends on their values. If fidelity is a core value for him, then his reaction is justified. However, if someone judges another person for past infidelity without being the affected party, some might argue that's not fair.\n\nBut in this case, the author isn't just judging; he's considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past actions. Since he's the one who has to live with her in the current relationship, his feelings matter. The fact that she cheated in the past, even if it was with someone else, could affect trust and compatibility. So, from the author's perspective, he's not in the wrong for needing to reassess the relationship based on his values.\n\nHowever, some might say that holding a past infidelity against someone when you're not the one they cheated on is overly harsh. The girlfriend has already taken responsibility, and the author is making a decision based on his own standards. It's a personal choice, and whether it's right or wrong can be subjective. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author is making a decision that aligns with his values, so he's not necessarily at fault.\n"
