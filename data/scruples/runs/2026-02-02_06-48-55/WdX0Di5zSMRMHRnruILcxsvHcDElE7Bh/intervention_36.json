We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend cheating on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after getting back together with him. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past infidelity, even though it was with a previous partner, not him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Cheating is generally considered wrong in relationships because it breaches trust and commitment. However, the key here is that the cheating occurred in a past relationship. The author isn't the one she cheated on; he's the new partner. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship over her past actions.\n\nThe author values fidelity, which is understandable. He's honest about his stance and has communicated that he wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance. Now, he's struggling with the fact that his current girlfriend had a history of cheating in her past, even if she's confessed and is open about it. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, people have the right to set boundaries based on their values. If the author cannot accept someone with a history of cheating, even if it's in the past and not directed at him, that's his personal boundary. On the other hand, the girlfriend is being transparent and has taken responsibility by confessing. \n\nThe debate here is whether the author is overstepping by ending the relationship over her past. Some might argue that past relationships are just that\u2014past\u2014and that forgiveness and moving forward are essential. Others might say that if someone values fidelity so highly, it's reasonable to reassess a relationship where the partner has cheated in the past, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nHowever, the author isn't the one who was cheated on. He's reacting to her past actions, not current ones. This could be seen as holding a past mistake against her, which might not be fair. But if his values are non-negotiable, then his decision is based on his own principles. \n\nIt's also important to consider that relationships require mutual understanding. If the author can't empathize with her reasons (even if he doesn't agree), that might be an issue in the relationship. However, it's not necessarily his fault if he feels this way. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether holding past infidelity against a current partner is justifiable. Since the cheating wasn't against him, and he's choosing to end the relationship based on his values, it's a matter of personal ethics. However, some might argue that he's being unfair by ending the relationship over her past, especially since she's taken responsibility and is open about it. So, the answer could swing either way, but given the context, it's more about his personal values than being inherently in the wrong.\n"
