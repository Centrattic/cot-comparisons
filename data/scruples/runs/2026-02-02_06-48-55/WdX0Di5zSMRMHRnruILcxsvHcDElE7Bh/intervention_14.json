We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after they broke up, and now the author is considering ending their relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The girlfriend had a three-year relationship with Guy A, who cheated on her. She broke up with him when he was in a long-distance situation. Then she briefly dated Guy B, broke it off because she felt Guy B wasn't invested, and then got back with Guy A. After another three years, she ended things with Guy A, then met the author. But here's the key part: after breaking up with Guy B and reuniting with Guy A, she continued having a sexual relationship with Guy B for three years, even after they had technically broken up. She did this as a form of revenge because Guy A cheated on her.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he values fidelity and now is considering ending his current relationship even though he wasn't the one cheated on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nSo, is the author justified in his feelings? From a moral standpoint, the girlfriend did engage in infidelity during her past relationship with Guy A, even if it was after their breakup. The act of cheating, even as revenge, might be seen as wrong. However, it's in the past, and she confided in the author. The author is now reevaluating the relationship because he values fidelity, which is a common and reasonable stance. \n\nBut does the author have the right to be upset about something that happened in her past, especially since she's not his ex? Some might say that the author is overreacting because he wasn't the one betrayed. Others might argue that since he values fidelity, knowing that his current partner has a history of cheating (even if justified in her eyes) could impact the trust in their current relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, while in the past, could be seen as hypocritical, especially since she and the author emphasized honesty. If she was cheating on her ex, maybe her commitment to fidelity is questionable. But the author's decision to reassess the relationship is based on his values. It's not necessarily about being in the wrong, but about whether the author's reaction is reasonable. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and harm. The author isn't at fault for feeling hurt by his partner's past actions, especially if those actions contradict the values they both thought they shared. The girlfriend is in the wrong for cheating, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for considering ending the relationship because of it. He's acting on his own values and the breach of trust in their current relationship, given her history.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
