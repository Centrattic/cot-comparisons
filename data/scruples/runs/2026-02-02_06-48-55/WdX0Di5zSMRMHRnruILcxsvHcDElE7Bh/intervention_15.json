We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is from a guy who's dating his current girlfriend, but he found out that she cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with her previous ex (Guy B). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the timeline: She had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then broke up because he cheated. She then had a brief relationship with Guy B, broke up with him because he wasn't invested, got back with Guy A, and they stayed together for another three years, leading to an engagement. After the engagement ended, she met the author. Now, she confessed that after getting back with Guy A, she continued having a relationship with Guy B for three years as revenge because Guy A had cheated. \n\nThe author is upset because he values fidelity and can't accept that she cheated on her ex. He's considering ending the relationship now. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset about her past infidelity, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nHmm. Well, fidelity is generally a key component in relationships. If someone cheats on a past partner, it's their past, but the fact that it's come up in her current relationship might affect how the current partner feels. The author is concerned because he values honesty and fidelity, which he's already mentioned as important. She brought up the confession herself, so it's not like he found out through something else. \n\nBut is he in the wrong for not wanting to be with someone who cheated in the past? I think it's a matter of perspective. Some people might say that she's grown from that experience and it's in the past, so it's not fair for him to hold it against her. Others might argue that if someone can't be trusted to be faithful in a past relationship, there's a risk they might do it again. \n\nAlso, the context of her cheating as revenge is important. She wasn't in love with Guy B and wasn't satisfied with him, but she continued the affair as a way to get back at Guy A. That adds a layer of emotional manipulation. However, the author is now trying to reassess the relationship because he can't accept it. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If someone has a history of infidelity, even in the past, it might make the current partner uneasy. The author is being honest about his values and is considering ending things because of this. On the other hand, she is being honest by confessing and taking responsibility. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not. He has the right to his values and to decide whether he can be in a relationship with someone who cheated in the past. People have different standards, and if fidelity is important to him, he's not obligated to overlook that. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
