We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (who is the boyfriend in this situation) is in the wrong. The main issue is that his girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after initially breaking up with him, then getting back together. The author is considering ending their relationship because he can't accept her past cheating, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girlfriend was in a relationship with Guy A, found out he cheated, broke up, then briefly dated Guy B before getting back with Guy A. After getting back together, she continued having sex with Guy B for three years as a way to get back at Guy A for cheating. She stopped when Guy A proposed. Now she's with the author and confessed this. The author is struggling with whether he's at fault for ending the relationship because he values fidelity highly and can't reconcile with her past actions.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's right to feel this way. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not accepting her past cheating. Since he's not the one she cheated on, does that mean it's not his place to be upset? Or is it reasonable for him to have boundaries about past infidelity, even if it's not directed at him?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a new relationship where trust and honesty are valued. His girlfriend's actions involved cheating on her ex, which she admits was vindictive. Even though it's in the past, the author feels it's a deal-breaker because he can't accept someone who has cheated. The girlfriend is being honest now, which is good, but the author's stance is about his own values.\n\nThe question is whether it's fair for him to end the relationship over her past with another person. Since he's not the one she wronged directly, some might argue he's overstepping. However, if fidelity is a core value for him, and he can't reconcile with her past behavior, then it's his right to make that decision. People have different standards, and if her past actions conflict with his values, it's not necessarily his fault for choosing to end the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that her cheating was in the past and with her ex, so the author shouldn't hold it against her. But others might argue that someone's past behavior can be indicative of their character, and if someone is willing to cheat before, there might be concerns about future behavior.\n\nSo, considering that the author is up front about valuing fidelity and is acting on his own principles, even though the cheating wasn't against him, he might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if someone else's past infidelity isn't relevant to the current relationship, then he could be overreacting. But given that he's clear about his values and she's aware of them, it's a matter of whether he's being reasonable.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at whether the person's reaction is justified. If the author's main issue is that she cheated in the past, and he's clear about his stance on fidelity, then his decision to end the relationship might be seen as his right. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
