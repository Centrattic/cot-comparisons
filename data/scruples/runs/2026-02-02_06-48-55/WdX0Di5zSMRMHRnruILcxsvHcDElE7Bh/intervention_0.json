We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after a breakup, and now the author is considering ending their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The girlfriend was in a three-year relationship with Guy A, who cheated. She left him, had a brief fling with Guy B, then got back with Guy A, who proposed. But then she cheated on him with Guy B again for three years, even after the proposal, until she finally left him when she met the author.\n\nThe author is upset because the girlfriend cheated on her ex, even though it was in the past. He's trying to understand her reasons, like she was seeking revenge for being cheated on. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he values fidelity and is upset that his girlfriend had a long-term affair with someone else. Even though she's not cheating on him, he feels it's a red flag because it shows a pattern of dishonesty or lack of commitment. On the other hand, some might argue that past relationships don't affect the current one, especially if she's honest now and not cheating on him.\n\nBut the author is re-evaluating the relationship because of her past actions. The key points are: 1) She cheated on her ex for three years. 2) She was honest with the author about it. 3) The author is conflicted because he values fidelity, and this might influence his trust now.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, people have different standards. If the author is a person who can't accept that his partner had a long-term affair with someone else, even if it's in the past, he's not wrong for feeling that way. But if he's ending the relationship because of past actions that don't affect their current relationship, some might say he's overreacting. However, it's his right to set boundaries based on his values.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions in the past could be seen as a sign of immaturity or poor judgment, which the author is now considering. Since the author is the one who values fidelity, and the girlfriend's past behavior might make him doubt her current commitment, even if she's honest now, his decision to reassess isn't necessarily wrong. He's not the one she cheated on, but her past actions might affect his trust and future with her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on his own values and the importance of trust and fidelity in the relationship. Even though she's not cheating on him, the pattern of behavior might be a deal-breaker for him, and he's entitled to that feeling.\n"
