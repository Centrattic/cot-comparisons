We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girl he's dating cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after a breakup with another guy (Guy B). The author finds out and is considering ending their relationship because he values fidelity. He's asking if he's in the wrong for being upset even though he's not the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. She was with Guy A for three years but he cheated. She broke up, had a brief fling with Guy B, then got back with Guy A. After he proposed, she ended it again. But in between, she continued sleeping with Guy B during her time with Guy A, even after rekindling their relationship. She did this for three years as a form of revenge because he cheated on her. She confessed to the author after they started dating.\n\nThe author is upset because he values fidelity and can't accept that she cheated, even though it was in the past. He's thinking of ending the relationship. The key issue here is whether he's wrong to feel that way.\n\nOn one hand, he's not the one she cheated on, so maybe he shouldn't be angry. But he's in a relationship now and values honesty and loyalty. He's trying to understand her reasoning, but it's hard for him to empathize. She admitted her past, but he can't move past it. \n\nThe question is whether his reaction is justified. If fidelity is important to him, then his feelings are valid. Even though he's not the one wronged, he's in a relationship with her and her past actions might affect trust. However, some might argue that past relationships shouldn't matter if she's honest now. But others might say that cheating is a red flag, regardless of the context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's choosing to end the relationship because of her past actions, but she's honest about it and it's in the past, maybe he's overreacting. However, if fidelity is a non-negotiable for him, then his decision is his own. The problem is whether his reaction is unfair. \n\nI think the answer depends on how much weight to give past actions in a current relationship. If she's being transparent and the cheating wasn't directed at him, he might be the one in the wrong for ending it. But if he values fidelity highly, then it's his choice. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his feelings are valid and he's choosing to end the relationship based on his values. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the past cheating isn't relevant now. Hmm.\n"
