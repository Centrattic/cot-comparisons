We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with him but before getting back together with him. The author is upset about this and considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The key points here are that the girlfriend cheated on her ex three years ago, after breaking up with him but before getting back together. She's confessed this to the author, and he's struggling with it. The main question is whether the author is at fault for being upset about something that happened in her past, especially since he's not the one she cheated on.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he values fidelity and has mentioned that he wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance. He's now considering breaking up because he can't accept her past actions. However, since he's not the one who was cheated on, the direct betrayal isn't towards him. Still, trust and comfort in a relationship are important. If the girlfriend's past actions make him feel uncomfortable or question her ability to be faithful, that's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is being honest about her past, which is a positive step. She's taking responsibility, and the cheating happened in a previous relationship. The author might be projecting his own values onto her past, but it's also about whether he can trust her moving forward. The fact that she cheated for three years shows a significant lapse in judgment, which might affect his confidence in her fidelity now.\n\nThe community often has mixed views on these things. Some might say that past actions shouldn't affect current relationships unless they directly impact the current partner. Others argue that past behavior can indicate future behavior, so it's reasonable to be concerned. The author isn't in the wrong for having concerns, especially if her past affects his trust. However, ending the relationship over someone else's infidelity might be a personal choice, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author is struggling to reconcile his values with her past, it's his right to decide if he can move forward. Since she cheated on someone else, not him, maybe he isn't at fault. But if he's using this as a reason to end the relationship now, perhaps it's a matter of his own priorities. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's allowed to have boundaries about fidelity. However, some might argue that he's overreacting to a past issue. But since he's clear about his values and she knew about them before they started dating, he's justified in reassessing. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
