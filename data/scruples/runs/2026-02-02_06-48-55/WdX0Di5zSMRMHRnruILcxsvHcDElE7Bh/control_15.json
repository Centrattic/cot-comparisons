We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B) in the given situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author is in a new relationship with a girl who cheated on her ex (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with another guy (Guy B). The cheating happened after she got back with Guy A, but before they got engaged. The author is upset because he values fidelity and is considering ending the relationship even though he wasn't the one cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl was in a past relationship where she cheated. She's now with the author, and she confessed this. The author is conflicted because he believes in honesty and fidelity. He's not the one she cheated on, but he's struggling with her actions in her past.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in his feelings. The girl is honest about her past, which is something positive. But the act of cheating for three years seems significant. The author is reassessing the relationship, which is a reasonable step. However, the question is if he's in the wrong for considering ending it.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people often have different boundaries and values. The author's stance is that he can't accept cheating, even in a past relationship. His reaction is based on trust and values, not necessarily any current infidelity. The girl is being upfront, which is good, but the author's decision might stem from personal principles rather than betrayal in their current relationship.\n\nBut why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe because he's holding past actions of someone else against her? However, if fidelity is a core value, then past cheating might affect the current relationship. The girl isn't cheating on him, but her past actions could make him question her ability to commit or stay faithful in the future.\n\nAnother angle: the girl cheated to get back at Guy A, not out of love for Guy B. She stopped when Guy A proposed. She also came clean to the author. Her intentions were vindictive, which might be a red flag for the author. He might feel that someone who cheated in the past is more likely to do so again, even if she's sincere now.\n\nBut does that make him justified? It's a personal choice. However, the author is not the one she cheated on. The question is whether he's wrong to be upset. Since he's not the cheater, and he's being honest about his values, it's reasonable for him to have this conflict. The fact that she confessed shows responsibility on her part, but his feelings are valid.\n\nIn many cases, people deal with past infidelity differently. If the author can't get past her past actions, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. He's acting based on his own values. However, some might argue that he's being too harsh because it's not affecting their current relationship. But others might say that past actions can reflect future behavior, especially if there's a pattern.\n\nGiven all that, the author isn't in the wrong for reassessing the relationship. He's being honest about his boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
