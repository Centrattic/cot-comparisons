We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy whose girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend three years ago. The question is whether he's at fault for considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend had a past relationship with Guy A, who cheated on her. She broke up with him, started a brief relationship with Guy B, then got back with Guy A. After that, she continued having sex with Guy B even after getting back together with Guy A, which lasted three years. She admitted this to her current partner, and he's now thinking about ending things. The author (he) is the one who's not the person she cheated on, but he's upset about her past actions.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know my opinion. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no (he's not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Cheating is generally considered a serious betrayal. Even though it's in the past, the fact that she cheated on her ex, and the author is now affected by this information, is a key point. The author values fidelity and has made that clear. The girlfriend confessed, which shows some level of honesty, but the cheating itself is a red flag for the author.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author can't move past this, even though he wasn't the one cheated on, it's his personal boundary. People have different thresholds for what they can accept. The author might be overreacting, but he's the one who feels this is important. The girlfriend's actions in the past, especially with someone else while supposedly back with Guy A, could be seen as deceitful towards Guy A, but the author is now the one struggling with it.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his values. If he feels he can't trust her or move past this, it's his decision. The fact that she continued the affair for three years suggests a pattern of dishonesty or lack of commitment in her past, which might affect the current relationship. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's acting on his own principles. Cheating is a dealbreaker for many, and even if it's in the past, it's a valid concern. The author isn't the one cheated on, but his emotional response is still valid. It's not his fault for feeling that way. So the answer would be B.\n"
