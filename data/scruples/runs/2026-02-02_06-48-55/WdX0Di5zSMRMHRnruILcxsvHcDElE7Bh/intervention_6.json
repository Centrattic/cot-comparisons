We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend cheating on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with her first co-worker (Guy B). The key points here are understanding fidelity in past relationships and how that affects the current relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because their girlfriend cheated on her ex, not on them. They're questioning whether they're being unreasonable for considering ending the relationship. The girlfriend was honest about her past, which is a positive. She cheated on Guy A as a form of revenge, which might be an emotional issue. The author values fidelity highly, which is valid, but the cheating occurred in the past, not in their current relationship.\n\nNow, the author's main issue is not betrayal by their current partner but moral disapproval of their partner's past actions. The question is whether this disapproval is justified. Some might argue that past relationships are past and don't affect the current one, especially if both are committed now. Others might see the author's stance as being overly judgmental, given that the cheating happened before they met.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were unethical, but since it's in the past and she's honest now, the author's reaction could be seen as holding a grudge. However, if fidelity is a core value for the author, they have the right to reassess the relationship. The problem here is whether the author is overreacting. Since the cheating was against her ex, not the author, some might say the author is in the wrong for ending things over someone else's past mistakes. Others might support the author's decision if they can't get past the infidelity in her past.\n\nConsidering the options, the answer hinges on personal values. If fidelity is non-negotiable and the author can't move past it, they might not be in the wrong. But if the cheating was in the past and the current relationship is healthy, the author could be seen as the asshole. Given the scenario, the author is not the one who was cheated on, so their reaction might be more about their own values than actual betrayal. However, people have different thresholds for forgiveness. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the person who isn't directly wronged but is making a decision based on personal ethics isn't automatically the asshole. But if the main issue is someone else's past, it's a gray area. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if they value fidelity highly. But others might argue that focusing on the ex's infidelity is unnecessary. The final answer could be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, since the author is not the one who was cheated on and is making a choice based on their values, the answer might be B.\n"
