We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a current relationship with a girl who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with another guy (Guy B). The cheating happened after she got back together with Guy A, even though she ended things with B. Now the author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that she cheated. He's not the one she cheated on, but he's upset about it because they value honesty and fidelity. She confessed everything, acknowledging her past mistake.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's reaction to his girlfriend's past infidelity. Even though he's not the one she cheated on, he's struggling with whether he can accept this part of her history. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because of something she did in a past relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of being \"in the wrong.\" If someone is in the wrong, it usually means they've done something morally incorrect or breached some standard. The author isn't cheating; he's being honest about his values. He's told her his stance on fidelity and is now reassessing the relationship because he can't accept her past actions. But since he's not the one she cheated on, is he overstepping?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and values are crucial. If someone has a strong value about fidelity and finds out their partner has cheated in the past, even with someone else, it's natural for them to have reservations. However, there's a difference between cheating in a current relationship and past behaviors. Cheating in a past relationship isn't a betrayal of the current partner, so the author might be holding her to a standard that applies to their relationship but not to her past.\n\nBut the author is being upfront about his feelings. He's not keeping it a secret and is considering ending things because he can't reconcile his values with her past. Is it his place to judge her past? Some might argue that her past doesn't define her and that she's taking responsibility by confessing. Others might say that the author has the right to his feelings and to make decisions about his own relationship.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't doing anything wrong by expressing his discomfort. However, whether he's in the wrong for possibly ending the relationship depends on context. If he's acting based on his own values and being transparent, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's being hypocritical or not considering her growth since then, maybe there's some nuance.\n\nWait, but he's not the one she cheated on. So he's not the \"cheated on\" person. His issue is with her past behavior, not current actions. In this case, his reaction is about his personal boundaries and whether he can move past her past actions. It's a matter of personal values and relationship compatibility. If he can't accept her past, even though he's not directly affected, it's his choice. But some might argue that holding past mistakes from a different relationship against someone is unfair, especially if she's acknowledged and taken responsibility for them.\n\nOn the flip side, if fidelity is a core value for him, and he can't trust or accept that she cheated even in the past, then his decision is based on his own standards. He's not wrong for having those standards. So the answer might depend on whether his reaction is justified based on mutual values. Since they both value honesty, and she was honest about her past, maybe the issue is about whether he's being reasonable or just projecting his own standards onto her past.\n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, it's often advised that people can't control their past but should consider the current partner's ability to move forward. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having issues with her past, but he's also not in the wrong for wanting to end things if he can't accept it. However, some might say that he's being unfair because he's not the one wronged, and her current behavior is what matters. But he's making a choice based on his comfort and trust, which is his right.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because he's acting on his own values and the fact that he can't accept her past actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
