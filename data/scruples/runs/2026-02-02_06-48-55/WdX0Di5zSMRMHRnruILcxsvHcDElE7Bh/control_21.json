We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a guy in a current relationship with his girlfriend, who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with him. The key question is whether the author is at fault for considering ending the relationship because of her past actions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The girlfriend had a long-term relationship with Guy A, cheated on him, broke up, had a brief relationship with Guy B, then got back with Guy A. During that time, even after breaking up with Guy B, she continued having sex with him for three years as a form of revenge. Now she's with the author, and he's struggling with this because he values fidelity. He's thinking of ending the relationship even though she didn't cheat on him.\n\nThe author isn't the one she cheated on, but he's upset about her past actions. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling this way. From a moral standpoint, cheating is generally frowned upon, and if someone has a history of cheating, a current partner might feel betrayed or unable to trust them. However, the cheating occurred in the past with a previous partner, not the current one. The author is concerned that her past behavior might indicate a pattern or a lack of commitment to fidelity.\n\nBut does that make him at fault for wanting to end the relationship? The author is being honest about his values and his inability to accept her past actions. He's not the one who was wronged in the cheating incident, but he's making a personal decision based on his own standards. He's also given her a chance to explain and has been trying to understand, but still feels it's a deal-breaker. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's overreacting because he wasn't the one she cheated on. He's making a judgment about her past, which could be seen as unfair or holding a grudge. However, if fidelity is a core value for him, and he can't reconcile her past with their current relationship, his choice to end things isn't necessarily wrong. It's a personal decision based on his own boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether it's reasonable for him to hold her past actions against her when she's now in a relationship with him. Since he values fidelity and her past behavior conflicts with that, even if it was with a previous partner, his reaction is based on his own principles. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong for deciding to end the relationship. But if someone's past actions shouldn't affect current relationships unless they directly impact the current partner, then maybe he is overstepping. However, in the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) type questions, the community often considers the person's right to make personal decisions about their relationship. So, probably answer B (No) he's not in the wrong.\n"
