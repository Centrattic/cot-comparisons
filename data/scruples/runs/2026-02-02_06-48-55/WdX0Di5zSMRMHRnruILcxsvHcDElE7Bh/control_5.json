We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating a girl who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after getting back together with him. She cheated with Guy B, who was her co-worker, after she had previously broken up with Guy A, then briefly dated Guy B, then got back with Guy A. The cheating continued for three years after she was back with Guy A, and she only stopped when he proposed. Now the author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that she cheated, even though it was on her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author isn't the one who was cheated on; he's the current boyfriend who found out about her past actions. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset and considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe person argues that fidelity is important to him. He's not the one she cheated on, but he's struggling with the fact that she did cheat in a past relationship. The common question here is whether past infidelity can affect a current relationship. Some might say that since he's not the one she cheated on, he shouldn't hold it against her. Others might say that if trust and fidelity are important to him, it's valid for him to have issues with that.\n\nThe girl in question came forward and confessed, which is a positive step. She says she was hurt and it was retaliation. However, the author can't understand her reasoning and is considering breaking up. The AITA here depends on whether the author is justified in his feelings. Since he's a \"big on fidelity\" person, it's reasonable that he has strong feelings about this. People have different thresholds for what they can accept in a partner's past. \n\nIn many cases, people do judge others for past infidelity even if they weren't the ones wronged. It's about personal values. If fidelity is non-negotiable for the author, then he's not in the wrong for reassessing the relationship. The fact that she cheated in the past with someone else doesn't directly harm him, but it can affect his trust and feelings towards her. However, others might argue that he's being overly judgmental. \n\nBut in the context of the AITA format, the person is asking if they're the asshole. If he's being honest about his values and making a decision based on them, he's not necessarily the asshole. The key is that he's not the one she cheated on, so he's not wronged in the traditional sense. However, his feelings are valid. The answer would likely be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for being honest about his values and considering the breakup if her past behavior conflicts with his principles.\n"
