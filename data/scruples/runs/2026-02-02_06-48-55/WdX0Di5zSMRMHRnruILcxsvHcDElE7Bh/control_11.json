We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (the author) is in a current relationship with a girl. They've been open about their pasts, and both value honesty. The girl had a past relationship with Guy A, then briefly with Guy B, then got back with Guy A. Now, the author found out that after breaking up with Guy B, she continued to have sex with him for three years as a form of revenge against Guy A for cheating. The author is conflicted because he's a big on fidelity and is considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girl cheated on her ex (Guy A) with Guy B after they had already broken up. The cheating happened in the past, before she met the author. The author is now upset because he values fidelity, and he's struggling with whether to end the relationship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. The key points here might be: 1) The cheating happened in the past and not in the current relationship. 2) The girl was honest and confessed everything. 3) The author's stance on fidelity is clear, but the cheating wasn't directed at him. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries about what he can accept in a partner. If fidelity is a non-negotiable for him, then the fact that his girlfriend cheated in the past, even in a previous relationship, might make him question her character, even if she's remorseful. On the other hand, the cheater was the girl's ex, and the author wasn't involved in that past. The girl is honest now, which is a positive. \n\nBut here's a thought: Cheating in a past relationship doesn't necessarily reflect on someone's ability to be faithful in the current relationship. However, some people might have trust issues if a partner cheated in the past, regardless of the circumstances. The author's reaction is based on his personal values. \n\nAnother angle: The girl admitted to the cheating and brought it up, which shows honesty. The author is being honest about his feelings and considering the breakup because of his values. That's his choice. But is he wrong for doing so? Well, if he can't move past her past actions, even though she's made amends and is transparent now, then maybe he's being reasonable in his decision. However, others might argue that holding onto past mistakes isn't fair, especially if the person is remorseful and the actions were in the past. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at intent, harm, and the current situation. Here, the harm was done to the ex, not the current partner. The current partner isn't the one who was cheated on. The girl is honest, and the author is trying to process it. So, the author isn't the one who was wronged. His decision to reassess is his prerogative. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's choosing to end the relationship because of her past, even though she's open about it, is that unreasonable? It depends on cultural or personal norms. Some might say it's his right to decide if he can accept her past. Others might say it's unfair to judge someone for past actions, especially when they've taken responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong if he decides to end the relationship because he can't accept her past actions. His feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
