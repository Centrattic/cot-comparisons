We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves his girlfriend's past with her ex, Guy A. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then broke up because he cheated. She started a short relationship with Guy B, broke up with him, got back with Guy A, and then cheated on Guy A with Guy B for three years as revenge. Now the author is upset because he's into fidelity and considering ending things even though she didn't cheat on him.\n\nThe key points here are about past relationships and current feelings. The author isn't the one she cheated on, but he's still conflicted. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to accept her past actions. Jealousy or discomfort with someone else's history isn't inherently wrong. However, it's important to consider if her actions affect their current relationship. Since she's honest and confessed, maybe she's not hiding anything. But the author might be projecting his own values (like fidelity) onto her past, which is a different context. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's not the one she cheated on, is it fair to end the relationship over that? It could be seen as holding past actions against her, especially if they don't impact their current relationship. However, if fidelity is a core value for him, he might feel justified in reassessing. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Some would say he's being unfair because it's in the past and she's not his partner at that time. Others might say it's okay if her actions affect their trust now. But since the cheating wasn't directed at him, maybe he's overstepping. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's entitled to his values, even if it's about her past. However, others might argue he's holding her past against her. But given the context, B seems correct.\n"
