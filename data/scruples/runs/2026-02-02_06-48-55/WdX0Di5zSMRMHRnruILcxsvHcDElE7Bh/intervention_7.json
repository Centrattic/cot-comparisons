We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend cheating on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years while being back together with him. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept this past infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The GF had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then broke up when he cheated. Then she dated Guy B briefly, broke up, got back with Guy A for another three years. While back with Guy A, she continued having sex with Guy B for three years, which she justified as getting back at Guy A for cheating. Eventually, she left Guy A and started dating the author. Now, the author is conflicted because he values fidelity and is considering ending the relationship even though the GF didn't cheat on him.\n\nThe key points here are the GF's actions in the past. Cheating on her ex, even if it's in the past, raises questions about trust and boundaries. The author is not the one she cheated on, but he's still upset because their current relationship is based on honesty and trust. The GF confessed, so she's being honest now, but the author can't get past the fact that she cheated for three years on someone else. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's right to value fidelity and honesty. If he can't move past this, it's his right to reassess the relationship. However, some might argue that he's holding her past behavior against her, especially since it's with an ex and not him. People make mistakes in the past, but whether that affects the current relationship depends on both parties' values. \n\nBut in relationships, trust is crucial. If someone has a history of cheating, even if it's in the past, it might be a red flag. The author is within his rights to feel that this affects their current relationship. The GF's reasoning for cheating (getting back at Guy A) might not justify her actions, and the fact that she didn't feel any strong feelings for Guy B could be seen as a way to minimize her behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's choosing to end the relationship because of her past actions that go against his values, then maybe not. He's being honest about his needs and boundaries. On the other hand, if he's overreacting because he's not the one she cheated on, some might say he's being unfair. But given that he's a person who values fidelity and the GF's actions contradict that, it's reasonable for him to reassess. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
