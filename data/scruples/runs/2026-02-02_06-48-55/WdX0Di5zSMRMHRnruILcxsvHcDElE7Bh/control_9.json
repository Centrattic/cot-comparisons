We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for considering ending the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend had a long-term relationship with Guy A, who cheated. She broke up with him, dated Guy B briefly, then got back with Guy A. Later, she admitted that after reconciliation, she continued having an affair with Guy B for three years until Guy A proposed. The author finds out about this and is conflicted about whether to end the relationship.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The user is the one who's not directly wronged here, but the girlfriend's past actions are causing a problem now. \n\nThe user's perspective is that fidelity is important, which is a valid value. The girlfriend cheated on her ex, but the user wasn't the one cheated on. So the user's reaction is about their current relationship and trust. \n\nThe girlfriend is being honest now, which is a positive. But the user is struggling to accept that past behavior. The user is considering ending things, which might be a personal decision based on their values. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at the actions and intentions of the people involved. The author isn't the one who was cheated on, so he's not at fault for being upset. The girlfriend's actions in the past with her ex are her responsibility. The user is making a decision based on their own standards. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the user is reacting to the girlfriend's past infidelities, which are her actions, and the user has the right to decide his comfort level in the relationship.\n"
