We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're at fault for considering ending the relationship because their girlfriend cheated on her ex in the past. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a long-term relationship with Guy A, who cheated. She broke up with him, then briefly dated Guy B, ended that, got back with Guy A, and then stayed with him for another three years until he proposed. But after that, they broke up again, and she met the current boyfriend (the author). Now, the author found out that during her time back with Guy A, she had an on-again, off-again relationship with Guy B for three years, which she continued even after breaking up with him. She admits she did this out of anger and to get back at Guy A for cheating.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He values fidelity a lot and says he wouldn't have taken Guy A back. Now he's thinking about ending the relationship because he can't accept that his girlfriend was unfaithful to her ex, even though she wasn't his girlfriend at that time. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, key points: The cheating happened in the past, before the author and his girlfriend were together. The author isn't the one she cheated on. He's upset about her past actions. He's considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that she was unfaithful in a previous relationship. But he's not the one she cheated on. \n\nNow, the debate here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship over someone else's past infidelity. If the relationship is based on trust and mutual respect, then the girlfriend's past actions, while unethical, are part of her history. The author might feel that this reflects on her character and her ability to be faithful in the current relationship. However, since she wasn't cheating on the author, maybe it's not his issue to take personally. But on the other hand, if trust is a cornerstone of their relationship, the fact that she engaged in infidelity in the past might make the author question her commitment to fidelity, even if it was in a different relationship.\n\nAnother angle: She was the one who brought this up, showing some honesty. The author is struggling with whether her past actions affect their current relationship. Since she's not cheating on him, maybe the author is overstepping by ending the relationship. But if her past behavior is a red flag for potential future issues, then maybe the author is justified in wanting to reassess. But it's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nIn many cases, people can move on from their past mistakes, especially if they're honest about them. The author is making a judgment based on her past, which might not be fair since she's not cheating on him. However, if the author values fidelity so much that he can't be with someone who has cheated in the past, even if it was in a different relationship, that's his choice. But some might say that the author is in the wrong because he's not the one who was wronged in her past relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because it's his right to decide what's acceptable in his relationships. Others might argue A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because holding past mistakes from a previous relationship against her might be unfair. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for his reaction. In the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) stories, the community often looks at whether the person is overreacting. The author is not the one she cheated on, so his reaction might be seen as overstepping. However, if fidelity is a non-negotiable for him, then he's acting on his own values. \n\nI think the community might lean towards B, that he's not in the wrong. People have different standards, and if this is a deal-breaker for him, he's within his rights to walk away. But others might say he's being judgmental. However, since she's not cheating on him, and her actions were in the past, maybe he's in the right to prioritize his values. Alternatively, maybe he's being too strict. It's a tough call, but given the options, I'll go with B.\n"
