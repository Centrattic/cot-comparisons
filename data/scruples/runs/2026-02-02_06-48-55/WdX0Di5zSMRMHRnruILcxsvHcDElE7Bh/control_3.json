We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with another guy (Guy B) and getting back with Guy A. Now she's in a new relationship with the author of the post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. She had a three-year relationship with Guy A, who cheated on her. She broke up, then had a brief fling with Guy B, ended that because she still loved Guy A, got back with Guy A, and then stayed with him for another three years until proposing. But during those last three years, she cheated on Guy A with Guy B. Now she's with the author, and he's considering breaking up because he can't accept this past cheating.\n\nThe author is not the one she cheated on, so he's not in a direct relationship where she cheated. However, he's upset because he values fidelity and can't understand why she did that. She confessed, and he's thinking of ending things.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong, but since the author isn't the one who was cheated on, is he justified in ending the relationship? Some might say that her past actions are irrelevant to their current relationship unless they are causing issues now. However, trust and values are important in a relationship. If the author feels he can't move past this, even though she's honest now, then his feelings are valid. \n\nBut others might argue that since she's already confessed and they're in a new relationship, her past shouldn't affect their current relationship. However, the author values fidelity highly, which is a legitimate personal value. If her past behavior makes him uncomfortable to the point of breaking up, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own values. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's about his own values and how he feels about his partner's past actions, even if she's not cheating on him. But some might think he's overreacting. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's acting based on his own moral standards, he's not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n"
