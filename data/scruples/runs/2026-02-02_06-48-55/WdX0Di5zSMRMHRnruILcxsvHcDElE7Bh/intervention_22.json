We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves his girlfriend's past relationship with her ex, Guy A. She had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then a short one with Guy B, got back with Guy A, and during that time continued to cheat on Guy A with Guy B for three years. Now the author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past infidelity, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend confessed about her past actions. She cheated on Guy A, which was after breaking up with Guy B but while she was back together with Guy A. She says she did it out of hurt and as revenge. The author is upset because he values fidelity and can't understand her actions. He's now considering ending their current relationship because he can't reconcile with her past infidelity.\n\nThe central question is whether the author is at fault for wanting to end the relationship over her past actions. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, infidelity in a relationship is generally considered wrong. However, this is about past relationships. The author isn't the one who was cheated on. So, is it his place to be upset about her past? Well, in a new relationship, people often share their pasts, and some might find certain actions in a partner's past to be deal-breakers. The author is upfront about valuing fidelity, so he might feel betrayed or disillusioned that she cheated in a previous relationship, even if the cheating was mutual in a way (since Guy A also cheated on her first). \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is not the person she cheated on. He's a new partner, and she's honest about her past. He's choosing to end the relationship because he can't accept her past behavior. Is that fair? Some might argue that her actions in a past relationship don't affect their current relationship as long as she's being honest now. Others might say that if someone can't come to terms with their partner's past, maybe they're not ready for a committed relationship.\n\nBut then again, the author is being upfront about his feelings and his boundaries. If fidelity is important to him, and he can't reconcile that she cheated in the past, even if it's not recent, then it's his right to make that decision. However, the fact that she was in a different relationship and was dealing with her own emotions might be a factor in her actions. The author might be holding her to a standard he himself wouldn't meet, given that he says he wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance. Maybe that's hypocrisy?\n\nBut the key here is that the author is not the one she cheated on. So his moral stance is about his own values and boundaries. If he can't accept her past, even if it's in a previous relationship, then he's not in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. He's making a choice based on his own feelings and values. On the other hand, if her past actions are irrelevant to their current relationship, then he might be overreacting.\n\nBut since the situation is about whether he's in the wrong for his actions, the answer depends on whether his actions are justified. If he's honest about his values and makes a decision based on them, he's not in the wrong. The fact that she cheated in the past might not affect their current relationship, but if her past behavior concerns him, then he's allowed to have that reaction. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
