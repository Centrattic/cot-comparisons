We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong when they can't accept that their girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cheated on her ex with Guy B. She's now with the author, and he's conflicted because he values fidelity. He's considering ending the relationship because he can't get past her past infidelity, even though he's not the one she cheated on. \n\nThe key points here are: Her past cheating, their current relationship, his feelings about fidelity, and his decision to reassess or end things. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset about her past actions with someone else.\n\nI remember that in relationships, people often have different standards and tolerances for past actions. The author is clear that he values honesty and fidelity. His girlfriend admitted the cheating, and he's struggling with it. Since he's not the one she cheated on, maybe some would say it's not his place to be upset. But others might argue that past actions can affect trust and compatibility in the current relationship.\n\nBut wait, cheating on an ex is part of her history. The author is concerned about her honesty and his own ability to trust her. Even if she confessed, his issue is about her past behavior. If he can't move past it, maybe it's his choice to end the relationship. However, some might say he's overreacting because it's not relevant to their current relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if infidelity is a non-negotiable for him, then his decision to end things could be seen as justified. The fact that she cheated on someone else might not directly affect their current relationship, but her willingness to be honest and her past actions could impact their trust. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the past behavior is relevant. Since she's honest now and the cheating was with her ex, maybe the author is overstepping. But his feelings are valid, and if he can't accept it, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might say he's holding her past against her unfairly. \n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if he's choosing to end the relationship because of her past with someone else, that might be his choice, but not necessarily his fault. However, if the cheating on her ex is a red flag that affects their current relationship, then his reaction is reasonable. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because his feelings are valid, and if fidelity is important to him, being upset about her past cheating is understandable. However, others might argue that it's not his place to judge her past once they're not together with Guy A. But given that he's making a decision based on his own values, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
