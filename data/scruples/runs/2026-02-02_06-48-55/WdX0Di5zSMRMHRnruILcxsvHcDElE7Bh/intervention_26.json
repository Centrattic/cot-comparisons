We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because their girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend cheated on her ex (Guy A) with Guy B for three years after breaking up and getting back together with Guy A. She admits to this, and the author is upset about it. The author is now thinking of breaking up because they value fidelity.\n\nThe key point here is that the author was not the one she cheated on. The cheating happened in a past relationship. The author's current issue is with her past actions. But does that make the author in the wrong for being upset?\n\nWell, people often have boundaries about their partner's past, especially regarding infidelity. The author is clear they value fidelity and wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance. However, the question is whether being upset about a past infidelity makes the author in the wrong. \n\nCheating in a past relationship isn't against the current partner. The current relationship's issues would stem from how the partner handles that past. If the author is breaking up because of her past actions, which she's been honest about, maybe that's more about their own values than her being in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe they're not. If the author can't accept her past, even though she's honest and taking responsibility, then it's their choice to leave. However, it's not the author's place to judge her past relationships if they weren't involved in them. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's reaction is justified. If the author can't move past her past, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if the cheating in the past has no bearing on the current relationship, then the author might be in the wrong for ending it over something that doesn't affect them directly. \n\nAlternatively, the author might feel that her past behavior reflects on her character, making them question her trustworthiness. But if she's being honest now and there's no evidence of her lying or hiding things in the current relationship, then the author's decision might be based on her past, not her current actions. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe they are overreacting. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the cheating was in the past and she's being honest now, maybe the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over something that doesn't impact their current relationship. But others might argue that the author has the right to set boundaries based on their values.\n"
