We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend cheating on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after getting back together with him, and the author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept this past behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend was in a three-year relationship with Guy A, then a brief fling with Guy B, then got back with Guy A. After Guy A proposed, they broke up, and she met the author. The cheating happened during her time with Guy A after getting back together with him, which she admits. She's open about it now, and the author is conflicted because he values fidelity but wasn't the one she cheated on. \n\nThe key points here are: the cheating was in the past, with an ex, and she's honest about it. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past actions, even though it's not against him. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to end things based on her past with someone else.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people often judge based on intent and current actions. She's not cheating on the author, so there's no direct betrayal here. The author is making a choice based on her past behavior, which some might see as holding a past mistake against her, especially since she's being honest and he wasn't involved in that part of her life. However, others might argue that past actions can reflect on a person's values and whether they align with the author's. But since the cheating was on an ex and not the current partner, some might say the author is being unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has every right to set boundaries in a relationship. If fidelity is a core value for him, and he can't move past her past cheating (even if it's not against him), then ending the relationship is his choice. But is he in the wrong for doing so? If she's not hiding it and he's making an informed decision, maybe not. However, some might argue that it's his issue to work through, not necessarily her fault.\n\nThe AITA community often looks at who is being reasonable. Since she's the one who came clean, and the cheating was in the past, the author might be seen as the asshole for ending the relationship over something that doesn't directly involve him. Unless there's a pattern of behavior that suggests she might cheat again, which isn't indicated here, the author's reaction might be seen as unfair. The answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) if the community values personal boundaries. But if they think he's being too harsh over a past ex, then A.\n\nBut I need to consider that he's not the one she cheated on, so his reaction might be seen as not justified. The key is whether her past actions affect their current relationship. Since she's been honest and there's no ongoing issue, his decision could be seen as AITA. However, if he's clear that fidelity is important and he can't move past her past, maybe it's not his fault. But the answer is likely B (No) because he's making a personal choice based on his values, even if others disagree. Wait, but the question is if he's in the wrong. If he's not doing anything wrong by ending the relationship because of his values, then B. But if the community thinks his reaction is unreasonable, then A. Hmm. The answer is probably B because the author isn't the one who cheated; he's making a choice based on his standards. But some might see it as holding her past against her. I think it's a tough call, but leaning towards B.\n"
