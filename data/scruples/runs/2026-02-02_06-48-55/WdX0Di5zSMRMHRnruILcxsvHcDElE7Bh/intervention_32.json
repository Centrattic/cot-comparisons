We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated. The main question is whether the author is at fault for considering ending the relationship because their girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend three years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. The girl had a three-year relationship with Guy A, who cheated on her. She broke up with him when he was in another country. Then she had a brief fling with Guy B, broke up with him because she felt he wasn't invested and she still loved Guy A. Then she got back with Guy A, and during that time, there's this revelation that she cheated on Guy A with Guy B for three years after they reconciled. She only stopped when Guy A proposed. She said it was because she was hurt and wanted to get back at him, and she didn't have strong feelings for Guy B.\n\nNow, the author is in a current relationship with this girl. They both value honesty. She came clean about the past. The author is struggling with the fact that she cheated on her ex, even though he's not the one she cheated on. He wants to end the relationship because he's a big on fidelity. The question is, is the author wrong to feel this way?\n\nHmm. Well, fidelity is a key component in relationships for many people. The author is upset because he values honesty and trust. But the cheating happened in the past with her ex, not with him. However, he's now in a relationship and might be concerned about her ability to be faithful in the future, or maybe he's hurt that she didn't mention this earlier. But since she did come clean, maybe that's a plus. Also, she's being honest now, which shows she's trying to be transparent.\n\nBut does the past cheating on an ex affect the current relationship? If the author is a person who values fidelity, then finding out that his partner had a history of cheating, even in a past relationship, could be a red flag. Maybe he's worried she might do it again. However, some people might argue that past behavior doesn't define future actions, especially if she's been honest now and there's no indication she's cheating in the current relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the one she cheated on, so maybe he's overreacting. But if he feels that her past behavior could influence her trustworthiness in the current relationship, then it's his right to decide if he can move past it. The fact that she cheated for three years with someone else after getting back together with her ex is a significant part of her history. If he can't accept that, it's understandable he wants to reassess.\n\nBut is he in the wrong for wanting to end things? If he's made it clear that fidelity is important, and he can't reconcile that with her past actions, then he's not in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship. People have different deal-breakers. For some, a partner's past infidelity might be a deal-breaker, others might not mind as long as the current relationship is healthy. Since the author is clear about his values, it's his choice. She's already shown honesty by confessing, so maybe the issue is his personal boundaries.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because he values fidelity and can't accept her past actions, even though she was the one who cheated on her ex. It's his decision based on his own values.\n"
