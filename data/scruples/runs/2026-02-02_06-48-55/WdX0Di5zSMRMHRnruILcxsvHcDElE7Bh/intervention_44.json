We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after getting back together with him, and now the current boyfriend (the author) is considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The girl had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then broke up because he cheated. She started a short fling with Guy B, ended it because she still loved Guy A, then got back with Guy A. They got engaged, but broke up again a year later. After that, she met the author. Later, she confessed that during her time back with Guy A, she continued to have a sexual relationship with Guy B for three years, as a form of revenge because Guy A had cheated. Now, the author is conflicted about staying in the relationship because of this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong for considering ending the relationship when the girl didn't cheat on him. \n\nSo, the key points here are: cheating in the past, the reasons behind it (revenge), and how the current partner is reacting. The author values fidelity and has made that clear. The girl was honest about her past, but the author is now reassessing the relationship. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, infidelity is a serious issue. Even though the cheating was in the past and not on the current partner, it raises questions about the girl's ability to maintain a faithful relationship. The author is within his right to feel that this affects their current relationship, especially since he values fidelity highly. The girl's actions showed a history of breaking commitments, even if she later ended it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's in the past and the girl was honest. But the author's reaction is about trust and his own values. Since he's not the one who was cheated on, does he have the right to end things based on her past? That's a tricky point. On one hand, people can have issues with a partner's past, especially if it reflects on their character. On the other hand, the author wasn't wronged directly. The girl didn't lie to him about her past initially, but she did hide the cheating part until later. \n\nWait, actually, the user mentioned that the girl brought it up and confessed. So she was honest. The author found out through her confession. If she was honest, maybe the author is overreacting. But if her actions in the past show a tendency to cheat, that could be a red flag for the author. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community usually considers intent and fairness. The girl intended to hurt Guy A by cheating, which is morally questionable. The author is now facing her past behavior and is conflicted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending things. \n\nGiven that the author isn't the one she cheated on, but he values fidelity, and her past behavior might indicate a pattern, it's a matter of perspective. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong for reassessing the relationship. So the answer is B, No.\n"
