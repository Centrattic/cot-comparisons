We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) after a breakup and getting back together.\n\nFirst, the main points: The girlfriend had a three-year relationship with Guy A, then broke up because he cheated. She briefly dated Guy B, broke up, and reconciled with Guy A. After reconciling, she cheated on Guy A with Guy B for three years, stopping when Guy A proposed. Now she's with the author (the questioner), and he's considering ending things because he can't accept her past infidelity with Guy A.\n\nThe key here is that the author is not the one she cheated on. The question is whether he has a valid reason to be upset and consider ending their current relationship over her past actions. \n\nSome points to consider: \n- Cheating in relationships is generally considered a serious issue, but this happened in her past relationship with Guy A, not with the author. \n- She was honest with the author about her past, which is commendable. \n- The author values fidelity, which is understandable, but the betrayal here isn't directed at him. \n- The author is struggling with whether he can accept her past actions, which might be more about his own standards and how he views past relationships versus current relationships. \n\nPossible angles: \n1. The author has a right to his feelings and can decide he doesn't want to be with someone who has a history of cheating, even in past relationships. Some people might find that a deal-breaker, especially if they prioritize partners who have been faithful in all past relationships. \n2. On the flip side, people make mistakes in past relationships, and what matters is the current relationship. Since she's honest and he's not the one she cheated on, some might argue he's being overly critical. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship based on her past infidelity with someone else. If he can't move past it and it's causing him to lose trust or respect for her, then his decision is his to make. However, others might say that as long as she's faithful to him now, her past should be her own business. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for doing this. If someone else were in his position and felt the same way, is it wrong? Or is it a matter of personal boundaries? \n\nI think it's a bit of both. He's not in the wrong for feeling this way and making a decision based on his values. People have different standards, and fidelity is a common one. However, some might argue that he's projecting or overreacting because she didn't cheat on him. So the answer could hinge on whether personal history affects current relationships. \n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong (AITA), the answer might lean towards B (No) if the community believes that past infidelity isn't his concern unless she's currently being unfaithful. But others might say A (Yes) if they think he's being unfair for ending a current relationship over someone else's past.\n"
