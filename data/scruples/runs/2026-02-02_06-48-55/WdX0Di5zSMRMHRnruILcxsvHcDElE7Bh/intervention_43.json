We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is in a current relationship with a girl who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) with another guy (Guy B) for three years after they broke up and got back together. The cheating happened in the past, long before the user came into the picture. The user is now considering ending the relationship because they can't accept this past infidelity, even though they weren't the one she cheated on.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether the user is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship over the girl's past actions. Let's consider a few angles.\n\n1. **Timeline and Context**: The cheating occurred in the girl's past relationship. She was with Guy A for three years, cheated with Guy B for three years, and now is with the current partner. The user was not involved in any of that. The girl confessed on her own, which shows some level of honesty.\n\n2. **Trust and Fidelity**: The user values fidelity highly. If someone's past actions in a previous relationship are causing current trust issues, is that valid? Trust is a cornerstone of relationships, but past actions might not necessarily affect the current relationship if the person has changed. However, if the past actions indicate a pattern of behavior that the user can't reconcile with, it's reasonable to have concerns.\n\n3. **Intent vs. Action**: The girl cheated as a form of revenge or emotional response to being cheated on by Guy A. She claims she didn't have strong feelings for Guy B and wasn't satisfied. The user might find this hard to accept, especially if they value monogamy strictly. The intent (revenge) might not excuse the action, but it could mitigate it in some people's eyes.\n\n4. **Communication and Resolution**: The user is trying to understand the situation by seeking more details. The girl is open about her past, which is a positive. However, if the user can't move past it despite understanding, that's their personal boundary. The user has the right to decide what they can live with in a partner.\n\n5. **Right to Choose a Partner**: No one is obligated to be with someone whose past they can't accept. If the user's values (like fidelity) are non-negotiable and the past actions conflict with those values, it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship.\n\n6. **Potential Biases**: Sometimes, people might have biases where they expect a partner to be pristine in past relationships, even if those past actions don't impact the current relationship. However, the user is being honest about their feelings and isn't lying about their expectations.\n\nIn this case, the user isn't the one who was cheated on; they just found out about the partner's past. The girl isn't currently cheating on them, so the direct betrayal isn't there. But the user's discomfort is real. The key point is whether the user is wrong for prioritizing their own values over staying in a relationship. Since the user is being honest and communicating their feelings, it seems like they're acting within their rights. The girl is being upfront, so the user isn't being deceitful. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship if they can't accept the past actions.\n"
