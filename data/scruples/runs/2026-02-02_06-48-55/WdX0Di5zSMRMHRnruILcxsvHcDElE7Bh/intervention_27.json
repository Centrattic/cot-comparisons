We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years with another guy (Guy B) after breaking up with him, then getting back together with Guy A. Now, the author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept this past behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral wrongness of both parties. The girlfriend did cheat on her ex, which is a breach of trust in a relationship. However, that was in the past, and she's the one who came forward with the information. The author is now questioning their relationship because he's a big on fidelity person. \n\nThe key points here are the context and the timeline. The cheating happened in a past relationship, not the current one. The author wasn't involved in that situation, so technically, the girlfriend didn't cheat on him. However, some might argue that past actions can affect the current relationship, especially if the current partner is unsettled by it. \n\nThe user's stance is that the author is in the wrong. They might think that because the cheating was in the past and didn't involve the current relationship, the author is overreacting. On the other hand, others might say the author is justified in his feelings since trust is crucial in a relationship, even regarding past actions.\n\nI should consider the perspective of the author. He's uncomfortable with his partner's past infidelity, even though it wasn't directed at him. Emotionally, it's valid for him to feel that way. But morally, the girlfriend didn't cheat on him. The author is making a decision based on his own values. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he ends the relationship because of her past actions that didn't affect him, maybe. However, if he's transparent about his feelings and makes an informed decision, it's a personal choice. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if his reaction is understandable. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were wrong in her past relationship, but the author is now dealing with the fallout. Since the cheating wasn't against him, some might say he's not in the wrong for reassessing the relationship. Others might argue that he's being unfair. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might lean towards B (author is not in the wrong) because he's choosing to end the relationship due to his own values, even though the cheating was in the past. However, the answer could also argue that he is in the wrong for ending the relationship over something that didn't directly involve him. But since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, maybe I should reconsider. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know the opinion. The actual answer depends on whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the cheating was in the past and not against him, some might say he's being too harsh, hence in the wrong. But others might say he's right to prioritize his values. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting on his own beliefs about fidelity, even retroactively, it's a personal choice. However, the cheating wasn't against him, so maybe he is in the wrong for ending the relationship over someone else's past. But if he can't trust or accept her behavior, then it's a valid decision. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because he's making a choice based on his own values, even if it's about her past. But others might say he's being unreasonable. The original poster might be in a gray area. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the cheating was in the past, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
