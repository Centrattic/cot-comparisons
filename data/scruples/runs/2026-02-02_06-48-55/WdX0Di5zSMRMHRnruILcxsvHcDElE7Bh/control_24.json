We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their girlfriend's past relationship where she cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after they broke up. The author is upset about this and considering ending their current relationship because they can't accept that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend had a complicated past with Guy A. They were together, broke up, she dated Guy B briefly, got back with Guy A, and then later cheated on Guy A with Guy B for three years while they were in a long-distance relationship. Now, the author is conflicted because he values fidelity, and even though he wasn't the one she cheated on, he's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end things because of his girlfriend's past infidelity with someone else. \n\nI should consider a few things here. First, cheating is generally considered a serious breach of trust. Even if it's in the past, some people might feel that their partner's past actions affect their current relationship. The author mentions that they were open about past relationships and that honesty is important to both. So, maybe the author's issue is not just about the act itself but how the girlfriend handled it\u2014like not disclosing this during their relationship or maybe not taking it as seriously as he hopes.\n\nWait, the girlfriend did confess this to him. She brought it up on her own. So she wasn't hiding it. The author says he believes her and acknowledges she's a nice girl, but he's struggling to accept it. The fact that she cheated on her ex doesn't directly affect the current relationship, but the author is using it as a reason to break up because he can't get past it. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone has a strong value in fidelity and can't accept that their partner was unfaithful in the past, even if it's not toward them, it's their personal choice. But is that fair? Is it reasonable for the author to end the relationship over something that happened before they were together? \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did come clean, which shows honesty. The author might need to accept that people have pasts, and unless there's a pattern of deceit or repeated cheating, ending the relationship over past actions of someone else's ex might be harsh. However, if the author feels it's a deal-breaker, he's within his rights to make that choice. \n\nBut maybe the problem is deeper. The girlfriend cheated on her ex, which shows a pattern of breaking trust, even if it was out of revenge. The author might be projecting or using this as a way to avoid other issues in the relationship. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, sometimes communities judge based on how the person handles the situation. If the author is ending the relationship because of a past infidelity not involving him, some might say he's being overly judgmental. Others might say that fidelity is important and if someone can't accept his partner's past, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his reaction is justified. Since he's not the one who was cheated on, but he's ending the relationship because of it, some might see that as unfair. However, others might see that his values are important to him and that he's justified in walking away if he can't accept it. \n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend was honest, the cheating was in the past with a different person, and the author is ending the relationship because of personal values. The question is whether his reaction makes him the asshole. \n\nIn many discussions, people might argue that holding onto past infidelity (especially not towards oneself) is not constructive. But if someone has strong feelings about fidelity, they might feel it's a deal-breaker. \n\nI think the answer here would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's making a personal decision based on his values. Even though some might find it harsh, he's being honest about his feelings and taking responsibility for his decision. The girlfriend's actions were in the past, and he's not accusing her of lying or being deceptive. So, he's not the asshole.\n"
