We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) with another guy (Guy B) for three years after getting back together with Guy A. The current boyfriend (the author) found out and is considering ending the relationship even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend was in a relationship with Guy A, cheated, broke up, had a brief fling with Guy B, got back with Guy A, and then continued cheating on Guy A with Guy B for three years. She confessed all this to the author after they started dating. The author is now conflicted because he values fidelity and is considering ending the relationship, even though he was not the one cheated on.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking input. \n\nLet me consider both sides. The girlfriend did commit multiple acts of infidelity in the past, which the author finds unacceptable. Even though those actions were in her past, the author is now dealing with the emotional impact of her betrayal towards her ex. The author is honest about his values and is taking time to reassess the relationship, which is a valid approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend confessed everything upfront, which is commendable. She might feel that the past is in the past and that she's being unfairly judged. However, the author's feelings about fidelity are legitimate. People have different standards for what's acceptable in a partner's past, and it's reasonable for the author to prioritize his own comfort and trust in the relationship.\n\nCheating, especially over a long period and after reconciliation, is a significant issue. The girlfriend's actions with Guy B were a betrayal of her commitment to Guy A. While she might have rationalized it as retaliation, that doesn't negate the act of cheating. The author's decision to reassess is a personal choice based on his values. He isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his own relationship from the emotional fallout of her past actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He has the right to set boundaries and prioritize his own needs in a relationship.\n"
