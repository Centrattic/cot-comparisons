We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a previous relationship with Guy A that ended because he cheated. She broke up with Guy A, had a short fling with Guy B, then got back with Guy A. Later, she found out Guy A was cheating again, broke up, and then met the author. But here's the twist: after breaking up with Guy B but before getting back with Guy A, she continued having sex with Guy B for three years as a way to get back at Guy A. Now the author is upset because he values fidelity and can't accept that she cheated on her ex, even though he's not the one she cheated on.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for ending things because of her past actions with her ex? \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he values honesty and fidelity. He's not the one she cheated on, so he's not the direct victim. However, he's the one who's now in a relationship with her and feels that her past actions affect their current relationship. The girlfriend admitted the cheating, and he's trying to reassess. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal boundaries. If someone values fidelity highly and can't move past their partner's past infidelity (even with an ex), is that unreasonable? Some might argue that her past is in the past, and since he's not the one she cheated on, it's not his place to be upset. Others might say that trust and values are important in a relationship, so if her past actions conflict with his values, it's understandable for him to want to end things.\n\nBut the key point is that she cheated on her ex, not on him. So he's not the direct wronged party. However, relationships are about mutual values and compatibility. If her past behavior makes him uncomfortable or he can't trust her moving forward, then his feelings are valid. But is that making him in the wrong? It's more about whether his reaction is justified based on their current relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend did come clean, which shows honesty, but the author's issue is with her past actions. The question is whether he's overstepping by ending the relationship because she cheated on someone else. Since he's not the one she cheated on, maybe he's being too strict. But again, personal values matter. So there's a balance here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer often depends on the actions and intentions. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his values and needing to reassess. However, if he's punishing her for past actions that don't affect their current relationship, that could be seen as unfair. But since he's not the one she cheated on, maybe he's not in the wrong for ending things if it's a dealbreaker for him.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he has the right to decide his relationship boundaries based on his values, even if the infidelity was in her past with someone else.\n"
