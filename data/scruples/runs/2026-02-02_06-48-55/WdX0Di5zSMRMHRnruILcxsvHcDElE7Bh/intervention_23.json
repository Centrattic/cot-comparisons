We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The girlfriend had a three-year relationship with Guy A, who cheated. She broke up with him when he went long-distance. Then she briefly dated Guy B, broke up with him because he wasn't invested, and got back with Guy A. After three more years, she ended things with Guy A again. The key point is that during the time she was back with Guy A, after breaking up with Guy B, she continued having sex with Guy B for three years as a way of getting back at Guy A for cheating. She stopped when Guy A proposed. Now the author found out about this and is considering ending the relationship because he values fidelity and can't get past the fact that she cheated on her ex. \n\nSo, the author isn't the one she cheated on, but he's upset. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset and considering ending the relationship. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's someone who values honesty and fidelity. He's accepted her past relationships but this revelation is a problem. He's trying to understand her motives, but he can't get past it. He's not the one she cheated on, so maybe he's overreacting? Or maybe he's justified because the issue is about trust and honesty in their current relationship?\n\nOn one hand, the cheating happened in a past relationship, not with him. But she did confess to him, showing some level of honesty. However, he might feel that her past behavior reflects on her character regarding fidelity. If he values fidelity, maybe he's right to question if she can uphold that in their current relationship. But isn't it her past? Shouldn't he focus on her current behavior and honesty with him?\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's overreacting because her cheating was in the past and not towards him. He's allowed to have his feelings, but is it fair to end the relationship over something that didn't affect him? Also, she has already taken responsibility by confessing. \n\nBut fidelity is a personal value. If he can't accept her past actions, even if they didn't affect him, maybe he's in the right to reassess the relationship. However, some might argue that being upset over a past infidelity isn't fair, especially since she's being honest now. \n\nWait, but she cheated on her ex, which is in the past. The problem here is that she had a three-year affair with Guy B while being with Guy A. That's a significant period. The author might be wondering if he can trust her to be faithful now. However, since she's being open with him now, maybe he's overgeneralizing her past behavior. \n\nBut fidelity is a dealbreaker for some people. If he can't move past it, even though he's not the one wronged, maybe it's his own issue. On the other hand, if he's concerned about her ability to be faithful in their relationship, he has every right to question it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's choosing to end the relationship over her past actions that didn't affect him, maybe he's overreacting. But if he's worried about fidelity in their current relationship, maybe he's justified. The key is whether her past actions indicate a pattern that could affect their current relationship. However, since she's being honest now and has a different partner, perhaps the author is in the wrong for holding past actions against her. \n\nAlternatively, if he's someone who can't accept someone who cheated in the past, even if they've changed, then he's not in the wrong for having those values. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset and considering ending the relationship. \n\nIn some perspectives, people can be held accountable for past actions, especially if they're relevant to the current relationship. But since she's not cheating on him, maybe he's projecting his own values onto her past. \n\nI think the answer might depend on whether her past behavior affects their current relationship. If it doesn't and she's honest now, he's overreacting. But if he's worried about her fidelity in their relationship, maybe he's justified. But since the cheating was in a previous relationship, perhaps he's in the wrong for ending things over it. \n\nBut the user originally thought the author is in the wrong, but the answer might be the opposite. Hmm. The user initially said they think the author is in the wrong, but now they're asking. \n\nWait, the user's question is phrased as \"AITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\" So the author is asking if he's the asshole for being upset about her cheating on her ex. \n\nIn the AITA format, people often have to consider whether their reaction is justified. Since he's not the one wronged, his reaction might be seen as unfair. However, if fidelity is important to him, he might feel it's a red flag. \n\nThe answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he has the right to his values and can choose to end the relationship if he can't accept her past. But others might say he's overstepping. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, it's her past. On the other, if he can't accept it, it's his choice. However, in the AITA context, people often criticize holding past actions against someone. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). \n\nBut the key is that she cheated in a previous relationship. If he's holding that against her in a current relationship, maybe he's in the wrong. Unless her past behavior affects their current relationship. Since she's been honest with him now, and she's not cheating on him, perhaps he's just projecting. \n\nSo I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. He's being unfair to her past actions that affected her ex, not him. But if he can't accept it, maybe it's his own issue. \n\nWait, but some people do consider past infidelity as a red flag. So maybe it's not entirely his fault. It's a personal choice. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. I think the majority view would be that he's not in the wrong because it's his relationship and his values. But others might say he's holding her past against her. \n\nThe AITA subreddit often sides with people who are holding boundaries, especially if it's about fidelity. So if fidelity is important to him, ending the relationship because of that is justified. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). He has the right to choose his values and the kind of relationship he wants.\n"
