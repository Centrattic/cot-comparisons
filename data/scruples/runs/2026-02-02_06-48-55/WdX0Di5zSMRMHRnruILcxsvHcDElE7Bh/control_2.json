We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend had a past relationship (with Guy A) where he cheated. She broke up with him, then had a brief fling with Guy B. After breaking up with Guy B, she got back with Guy A. But during that time, she continued to have sex with Guy B for three years as some kind of revenge, then stopped when Guy A proposed. Now, she's in a new relationship with the author, but he found out about this past cheating. He's conflicted because he values fidelity, but he wasn't the one she cheated on. He's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is upset because he values honesty and fidelity. He's in a current relationship where trust is important. The girlfriend was open about her past, but the cheating was a significant betrayal in her past relationship. However, the author isn't the one who was cheated on in that situation. The cheating happened before he was involved. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is now dealing with the aftermath. If he values fidelity, maybe he's right to question if he can trust her in their current relationship. However, she was honest about her past, and she's not cheating on him. The cheating was in the past, not during their relationship. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting because he's projecting his own standards onto her past. He's not the one she hurt back then. However, relationships often involve trust and how past actions affect the current relationship. If the cheating in her past causes him to lose trust in her now, that's a valid feeling. \n\nBut is he in the wrong to end things because of her past, even if she's not cheating now? Some might argue that her past doesn't define her character, and if she's being honest and hasn't cheated on him, he should focus on their current trust. Others might say that past behavior can be a red flag, especially if it shows a pattern of dishonesty or betrayal. \n\nShe admitted the cheating and took responsibility, which is good. The author is trying to understand her reasons, but he's still conflicted. The key here is whether his reaction is justified. Since he's not the one she cheated on, maybe his reaction is too harsh. But he's allowed to have his own standards. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's choosing to end the relationship because of her past where she didn't cheat on him, perhaps he's not in the wrong because he's acting based on his values. However, others might think that holding onto past actions of someone else is unfair. \n\nBut the question is about the author's rightness. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) setup usually looks at if the person is being unreasonable. If the author is breaking up because of someone else's past actions that don't affect him, maybe he is being unreasonable. However, if the cheating in her past is making him doubt her honesty or commitment in their current relationship, that's a valid concern. \n\nBut the cheating was in the past, and she's been open about it. If he can't get past that, maybe the problem is his own insecurity or inability to separate past actions from the present. So, in that case, he might be the one in the wrong for not being able to trust her in a current relationship where she hasn't done anything to break that trust. \n\nAlternatively, if her past behavior shows a pattern of betrayal, even if it's not directed at him, maybe it's a red flag. But that's more of a personal judgment. \n\nI think the key point here is that the author is not the person she cheated on. Her actions in a past relationship don't directly impact their current relationship unless she's hiding things or being dishonest with him now. Since she came clean, maybe he's overreacting. So, in that case, he might be in the wrong for not accepting her past and breaking up because of it.\n"
