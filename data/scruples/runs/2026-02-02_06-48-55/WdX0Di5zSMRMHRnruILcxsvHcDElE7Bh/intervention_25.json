We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) with Guy B for three years after initially breaking up with Guy A. She had a short fling with Guy B, then got back with Guy A, but then continued the affair with Guy B. She was hurt by Guy A's cheating and used this as a way to get back at him. Now, the author is upset and considering breaking up with her because he values fidelity a lot.\n\nThe key points here are: the cheating happened in the past with her ex, not with the current partner. The author is not the one she cheated on. However, he's upset because he values honesty and fidelity in a relationship. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that she cheated on her ex, even though it's in the past.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether it's fair for him to end the relationship over his girlfriend's past infidelity towards someone else. On one hand, people often move on from past relationships, and holding past actions against a current partner can be seen as unfair. The girlfriend did confess everything, and the cheating was in the past. However, the author's feelings about fidelity are valid, and if he can't accept that behavior, even in a past relationship, it might be difficult for them to continue. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author is not the one who was cheated on. The girlfriend did cheat, but not on him. So, is it his place to judge her past actions? It's a matter of personal boundaries. If he can't accept someone who has cheated in the past, even if they've since moved on and are committed now, then it's his choice. However, some might argue that it's unfair to end a relationship over past actions that don't affect the current relationship. \n\nThe article might lean towards saying the author isn't in the wrong because he's choosing to end the relationship based on his values, even if it's about her past. Others might say he's being too harsh because it's not his relationship at the time. But since the answer requires a simple A or B, I need to decide based on the analysis. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on his values regarding fidelity, even if the cheating was in her past. However, it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives can be valid. But according to the given options, B is correct.\n"
