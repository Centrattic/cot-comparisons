We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend cheating on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) over three years. The author is considering ending the relationship because he values fidelity and can't accept her past actions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend was in a three-year relationship with Guy A, who cheated on her. She broke up with him when he started a long-distance relationship. Then she briefly dated Guy B but broke up with him because she felt he wasn't invested. She then reconciled with Guy A, who proposed, but they eventually broke up for good after she met the author. Now, the author found out that after reconciling with Guy A, she continued having sex with Guy B for three years, even after their breakup, as a form of retaliation for Guy A's cheating. She confessed this to the author, and now he's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for being upset about her cheating on her ex. He's not the one she cheated on, so he's not directly wronged. But he's concerned about her past actions affecting their current relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. However, in this case, the cheating happened in her past relationship with Guy A. The author is not the one who was cheated on, so his anger might stem from a value of fidelity and possibly jealousy or distrust in her ability to be faithful in the current relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend initiated the conversation, showing honesty, which is a positive. However, the act of cheating, even as retaliation, is a breach of trust in her past relationship. The author is now evaluating their current relationship because of this, which some might see as overstepping, as the past actions don't directly impact their current relationship. Others might argue that her history shows a pattern of infidelity, which is a valid concern for the future.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't do anything wrong. The girlfriend was unfaithful in her past, but the author is now dealing with the emotional impact of that. However, whether he's justified in ending the relationship depends on personal values. Since he values fidelity and finds it hard to accept her past, it's his prerogative to decide the relationship's future. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't commit any wrongdoing, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). However, some might argue that holding past actions against her in a current relationship could be unfair, especially if she's been honest and there's no indication of similar behavior now. But given the information, the author is making a personal decision based on his values, which is his right. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
