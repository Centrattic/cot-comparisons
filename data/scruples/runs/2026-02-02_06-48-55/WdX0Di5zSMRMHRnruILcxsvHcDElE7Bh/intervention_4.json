We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The user is the current boyfriend (gf) of a woman who cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years. The woman has confessed this to him now, and he's considering ending their relationship because he can't accept it.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The woman was in a relationship with Guy A for three years, then she broke up because he cheated. After a brief fling with Guy B, she got back with Guy A, who proposed. While engaged, she cheated on Guy A with Guy B for three years, stopping only after the proposal. Now, she's in a relationship with the author, who's upset about this past behavior.\n\nThe author believes in fidelity and has made it clear he wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance. He's now considering breaking up because he can't accept that his girlfriend cheated on her ex. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship despite not being the one cheated on.\n\nI need to consider the moral implications here. Cheating is generally considered unethical, but the woman was in a previous relationship. The author is upset that she cheated, but he's not her current partner at the time of the infidelity. Some might argue that past actions shouldn't affect current relationships if both parties are honest. Others might say that someone who values fidelity has the right to end a relationship if they can't accept their partner's past actions, even if it's not directed at them.\n\nHowever, the woman confessed the truth, which shows she's being honest. The author might feel betrayed not because he was cheated on, but because he can't accept her history. But is that a valid reason? It depends on personal values. Since the author has made fidelity a priority, he might not be in the wrong for choosing to leave. On the other hand, some might say he's being overly judgmental about her past mistakes that don't directly affect their current relationship.\n\nWait, but the woman cheated on her ex with someone else, not the author. So the author wasn't the one wronged. If the woman is honest and there's no deceit in their current relationship, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author can't move past it, it's his right to reassess the relationship. The key here is whether the author is acting unreasonably. Since infidelity is a serious issue, and he values it highly, his reaction might be justified from his perspective. The woman's actions were in the past, and she's upfront about it now. But the author's decision to end things might not make him in the wrong because he's acting based on his values.\n"
