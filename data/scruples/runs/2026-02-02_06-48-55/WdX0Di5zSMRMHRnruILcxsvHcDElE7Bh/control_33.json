We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years. The author is upset about this and considering ending their relationship. They want to know if they're in the wrong for being upset even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girl cheated on Guy A after breaking up with him, but before getting back together with him. She had a brief relationship with Guy B and then got back with Guy A. But after that, even though they were in a relationship again, she continued having sex with Guy B for three years, which she admitted was her way of getting back at Guy A for cheating on her. Now, she's with the author and confessed all this.\n\nThe author is a guy who values fidelity. He's not the one she cheated on, but he's upset because she cheated in her past. He's considering ending the relationship because he can't accept this. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this reaction.\n\nSo, why might he be in the wrong? Well, he's not the one she cheated on, so maybe he has no right to be upset about that. Maybe he's overstepping by judging her past actions before they were even in a relationship. Also, she's being honest with him, which is good. If he values honesty, maybe he should accept her past as part of her history and focus on the present. Maybe his reaction is too harsh because it's not his past to be upset about.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's justified. If the girl values honesty and they both agreed that honesty is important, then she bringing up her past is part of that. However, cheating is a serious issue, especially if she continued it after reconciling with Guy A. It shows a lack of commitment and possibly a pattern of behavior. The author might feel that her actions reflect on her integrity, which could affect their current relationship. If he can't trust her or forgive her for that, he might be right to consider ending things. Also, if she cheated for three years to get back at someone, that might indicate emotional issues or a tendency to act out of spite, which could be a red flag.\n\nBut then again, people can change. She's being open with him now, and the cheating happened in the past. If her current behavior is not an issue, maybe he's being too harsh. Also, he's not the one she cheated on, so maybe it's not his place to hold it against her. However, if he feels that her past actions affect their relationship's future, that's a valid concern. People have different standards, and if fidelity is a core value for him, he might need to be with someone who shares that view. But since she cheated on her ex, not him, does that matter?\n\nAnother angle: Did she cheat while in a committed relationship with Guy A? If they were back together and she was in a relationship with him when she cheated with Guy B, then that's a problem. The fact that she did this for three years shows a serious breach of trust. Even if they later broke up, the author might feel that such behavior is a red flag for future relationships. If she can't be faithful in a committed relationship, how can he trust her in their current one? However, he's not the one she cheated on, so maybe he's projecting his own values onto her past.\n\nBut he's in a relationship with her now, and his trust is important. If he can't move past this, it could be a problem. The issue is whether his reaction is justified. Some might say that unless she cheated on him, he has no right to be upset. Others might say that her past behavior reflects on her character and how she treats partners, which is relevant to their current relationship.\n\nIn the AITA format, often the person is in the right if they're standing up for their values. The author is being honest about his values and considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past actions. That's his right. On the other hand, if she's already shown she's being honest and open, maybe he's overreacting. But if her past behavior suggests she might do it again, he has a valid reason to be cautious.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's making a decision based on his values and the information he's learned. It's his choice how to handle the relationship, even if the cheating was on an ex. The fact that she cheated in a committed relationship is a red flag for him, and he's entitled to act on that.\n"
