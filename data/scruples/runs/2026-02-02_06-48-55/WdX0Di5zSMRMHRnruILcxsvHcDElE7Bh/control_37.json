We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a current girlfriend whose past ex was cheated on, and now the author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that she cheated on her ex-boyfriend three years after their breakup, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario clearly. The author's girlfriend had a past relationship with Guy A. They broke up because Guy A cheated. She then briefly dated Guy B, broke up, got back with Guy A, and eventually broke up again. After that, she met the author. The key point is that during the time she was back with Guy A, she continued to have sex with Guy B for three years as a way of getting back at Guy A for cheating. She claims she didn't have feelings for Guy B and wasn't satisfied with him sexually. Now the author is struggling with whether he's at fault for considering ending the relationship because he can't accept this past behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks for the person's actions in the situation. The author hasn't done anything wrong himself; he's just reacting to his girlfriend's past. The issue here is about the author's right to feel that her past behavior affects their current relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust and past actions can be a big factor. The author values fidelity and is having difficulty accepting that his girlfriend engaged in what he sees as cheating on her ex, even if he wasn't the one she cheated on. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **The Cheating Incident**: The girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) by being with Guy B after breaking up with him. However, the author isn't the one she cheated on. So, technically, he's not a direct victim here. But his feelings about it are valid because trust and past actions can affect a current relationship.\n\n2. **Communication and Honesty**: The girlfriend did confess everything to the author, which shows honesty. However, the author is struggling to understand and empathize. He's trying to reassess the relationship, which is a reasonable step if he feels the past actions affect their current relationship.\n\n3. **Values and Compatibility**: The author places a high value on fidelity. If he can't accept that she cheated on someone else in the past, even if he wasn't involved, it might indicate a compatibility issue. It's not about being right or wrong but whether their values align. The author has the right to his feelings, even if others might think he's overreacting.\n\n4. **Past vs. Present**: People grow and change. The girlfriend might have moved on and is being honest now. However, the author's discomfort is about her past behavior, which he feels is a deal-breaker. It's important to acknowledge that while the past doesn't define the present, some people might have issues with past actions affecting their current relationship.\n\n5. **The Girlfriend's Perspective**: She might feel that the author is holding her past against her, especially since she's already confessed and is trying to be open. She might not see how her past cheating on someone else affects their current relationship, especially since she's not cheating on the author now.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are objectively wrong. Here, the author hasn't done anything wrong himself. He's reacting to his girlfriend's past actions. His decision to reassess the relationship is his right, given his values. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not accepting her past. Since he's not the one who cheated and is acting based on his values, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). However, some might argue that he's being overly judgmental of her past, but in the context of their relationship and his stated values, his reaction is valid.\n"
