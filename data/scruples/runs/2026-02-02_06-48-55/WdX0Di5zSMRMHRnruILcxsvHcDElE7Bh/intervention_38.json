We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a girl, and he's upset because she cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years. He's considering breaking up with her because he values fidelity a lot, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl cheated on her ex, not the author. The author is now questioning their relationship because of her past actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship over her past cheating, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFrom one perspective, the author has a right to his feelings and boundaries. If fidelity is important to him, and he can't get past her past cheating, then it's his prerogative to reassess the relationship. However, the cheating happened in a previous relationship, and she has already confessed and is being honest. The author isn't the one who was betrayed in the past, so maybe it's his issue to work through.\n\nOn the other hand, cheating is generally a big deal, and the author is within his rights to feel that someone's past behavior affects their current relationship. But the key here is that he's not the one she cheated on. So, maybe the problem is more about his personal standards and whether he can accept her past. \n\nI need to think about whether it's fair for him to end the current relationship based on her past actions. If he can't move past it, then he's not wrong for doing that because it's about his own comfort and trust in the relationship. However, some might argue that she's already taking responsibility by confessing, and the author is overreacting because he wasn't the victim of the cheating. \n\nBut relationships are about mutual respect and understanding. If the author can't accept her past, even though he's not the one she cheated on, then maybe the issue is about his ability to trust and let go of past issues. Alternatively, it's his right to set boundaries based on his values. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's choosing to prioritize his values of fidelity, even if the cheating was in her past. However, some might say he's being too strict, but the decision to end a relationship is personal. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
