We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after initially breaking up with him. The ex cheated first, and then the girlfriend ended up cheating back with another guy (Guy B) during their reconciliation period. The author found out about this and is now considering ending the relationship because he can't accept the cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author isn't the one who was cheated on in the past; the girlfriend is the one who cheated on her ex. The author is currently in a new relationship and values fidelity a lot. He's upset that his girlfriend had an ongoing affair with another person for three years, even if it was in the past. \n\nFrom the author's point of view, the issue is that he's uncomfortable with his partner's past infidelity, even though it's not against him. He might feel that it reflects on her character and her ability to be faithful in their current relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might argue that it's her past and that she's made a clean break, being honest about it now. \n\nBut the key question here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship over this. The story mentions that the author is reassessing the relationship and considering ending it because of her past actions. The girlfriend cheated on her ex, which could be a red flag for the author, especially since he values fidelity. However, the author is not the one she cheated on, so the direct betrayal is to the ex, not to him. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of her honesty. She came forward and told him about it, which shows she values openness. However, the author might still struggle with the fact that she engaged in infidelity, regardless of the circumstances. The girlfriend's reasoning for cheating\u2014hurting her ex because he cheated\u2014might not excuse the action, but it does provide some context. \n\nIn relationships, past infidelity can be a deal-breaker for some people. If the author feels that he can't move past it, he's not necessarily wrong for wanting to end things. The fact that he's trying to understand her perspective by seeking more details shows he's making an effort, but if he still can't reconcile it, then his decision is his own. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting because he wasn't the one cheated on. The girlfriend is honest now, and the affair happened in the past. However, the author's feelings are valid, and if he can't accept it, it's his right to end the relationship. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. Since he's being honest about his values and his limits, and the girlfriend's actions (cheating) are a significant issue for him, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The decision to end a relationship over past infidelity is subjective, and there's no universal right or wrong. But in the context of the story, the author's stance is about his own boundaries, so he's not the one at fault here.\n"
