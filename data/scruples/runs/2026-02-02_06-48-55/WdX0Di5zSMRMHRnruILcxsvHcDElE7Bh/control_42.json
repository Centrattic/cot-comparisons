We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years. The author is considering breaking up with her because he can't accept that. They're both in a current relationship, and he's struggling with this past infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend was in a three-year relationship with Guy A, cheated on him with Guy B, broke up, then got back together with Guy A. During that time, she continued cheating on Guy A with Guy B for three years. She only stopped when Guy A proposed. Now, she's with the author, and he's upset because he values fidelity highly. He's thinking of ending things because he can't accept her past actions.\n\nThe key points here are: The author wasn't the one she cheated on, but he's feeling hurt and considering breaking up. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so. \n\nI should consider the concept of jealousy and personal boundaries in relationships. Even though the author wasn't the one she cheated on, he's making a choice based on his values. People have different thresholds for what they can accept in a partner's past. The author's stance is that he's a big on fidelity, so her past actions, even if not directed at him, are a deal-breaker for him.\n\nNow, some might argue that he's overreacting because it's in the past and she's being honest now. Others might say that he has a right to his feelings and values. The girlfriend did confess on her own, which shows some level of honesty, but the author's reaction is about his own emotional response. It's not about right or wrong in a moral sense, but about compatibility and personal values.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. It's about mutual respect for each other's values. If the author can't move past this, ending the relationship is a valid decision based on his standards. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
