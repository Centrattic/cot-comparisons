We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend confessing that she cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with him, getting back together, and then continuing the affair with another guy (Guy B) during their engagement. The author is conflicted about ending the relationship because they find it hard to accept her actions, even though they weren't cheated on themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend was in a previous relationship where she cheated on her ex-boyfriend after a breakup, then got back with him, and continued the affair with the co-worker for three years. She confessed to the author, and he's considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past infidelities. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nThe author is not the one she cheated on, so he wasn't directly wronged. However, he's struggling with the fact that she was unfaithful in a past relationship. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to confirm. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, cheating in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust and commitment. However, in this case, the cheating occurred in the girlfriend's past relationship. The author is now dealing with the aftermath of her past actions. The question is whether it's reasonable for him to end the current relationship based on her past behavior.\n\nSome might argue that the author is being too harsh because the cheating happened in the past and he wasn't directly affected. Others might say that fidelity is important, and if someone has a history of cheating, it raises concerns about their ability to maintain a faithful relationship, even if it's in the past. There's also the aspect of trust and whether the author can truly move past this, especially if he's a person who values fidelity highly.\n\nThe girlfriend did come forward with her past, which is a positive step. She's taking responsibility, and the author is trying to understand her reasons. However, the author's feelings of betrayal and inability to accept her past actions might be valid. Relationships require mutual values, and if fidelity is a core value for the author, he might feel that her past compromises that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that holding past mistakes, especially from a previous relationship where the person wasn't cheating on the current partner, is unfair. The girlfriend is now in a new relationship and has been honest about her past. The author's reaction could be seen as holding a past mistake against her, which might not be justified.\n\nBut considering that the author is the one who is uncomfortable and can't accept her past actions, it's his right to reassess the relationship. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his values, even if others might think he's being too strict. The key here is whether the past actions affect the current relationship's foundation. If the author can't trust her or feel secure knowing her history, then ending the relationship is a personal choice, not necessarily a wrong one.\n\nSo, putting it together: The author isn't the one she cheated on, but he's choosing to end the relationship because he can't accept her past infidelity. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reaction is reasonable. Since he's prioritizing his own values and the trust in their current relationship, it's a personal decision and not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
