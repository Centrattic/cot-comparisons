We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend (let's call her GF) is confessing about her past relationships. She had a long-term relationship with Guy A, then broke up with him after he cheated. She had a brief relationship with Guy B, broke up, got back with Guy A, and eventually broke up again after he proposed. Now, the author finds out that during the time she was back with Guy A (after breaking up with Guy B), she was still having an affair with Guy B for three years. She admitted to doing this as a form of revenge because she was hurt by Guy A's cheating.\n\nThe author is now considering ending the relationship because he values fidelity, and he's struggling to understand or accept her past actions. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship even though she didn't cheat on him.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, he's upset because his girlfriend has a history of infidelity in a past relationship, even if it wasn't with him. He values fidelity, and he's trying to process this. But is it his place to judge her past actions? She's not the one he's in a relationship with, and she confessed to him. He's considering breaking up because he can't accept her past. But is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, he has the right to set boundaries in his relationship. If her history of cheating makes him uncomfortable, maybe he's justified in wanting to end things. On the other hand, she didn't cheat on him, and she's being honest with him. Maybe he's overreacting because of his own values. Also, her actions were in the past, and she's taking responsibility. But he's not the one she cheated on, so maybe his reaction is a bit harsh? Or maybe not, because trust is important in a relationship.\n\nWait, but the key here is that she cheated on her ex, not on him. He's not the one she betrayed. So is he overstepping by holding that against her? Some people might think that past relationships are just that\u2014past. Others might see it as a red flag for potential future issues. The author is conflicted because he values fidelity, which is understandable, but is it fair to end the current relationship over her past actions?\n\nAlso, she brought it up on her own, which shows honesty. Maybe the author is right to want to reassess because trust is a big part of a relationship. But is it his place to judge her past? Or is he being too strict? It's a tough call. The answer could go either way depending on cultural or personal beliefs. But the author isn't the one she cheated on, so technically, he's not the one wronged. However, his feelings are valid, and he has the right to decide what he's comfortable with in a relationship. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B) because he's choosing to end the relationship based on his own values, even if she didn't cheat on him. Alternatively, maybe he's in the wrong (A) because he's holding her past against her when she's already confessed and is being honest. \n\nI think it's more about personal values. The author isn't at fault for having those values and making a decision based on them. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
