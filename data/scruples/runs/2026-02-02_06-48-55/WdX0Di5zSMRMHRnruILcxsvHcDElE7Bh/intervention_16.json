We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because his girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend three years ago.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend had a past relationship (with Guy A) where she discovered he cheated. They broke up, then she started a short fling with Guy B but felt it wasn't right and broke it off, then reconciled with Guy A. After another three years, they broke up again when she felt he wasn't committed. Now, she admits she cheated on Guy A by continuing to have sex with Guy B for three years after getting back with Guy A, as a form of revenge.\n\nThe author is a current partner who values fidelity. He's upset because she cheated on her ex, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on. He's considering ending the relationship because he can't accept that. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for this reaction. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't the one who was cheated on in her past. But he's upset about her past actions, which could be seen as prying or being judgmental about her past. However, he's also clear that fidelity is important to him, and he's struggling with the fact that she was unfaithful in a past relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend is honest and confessed herself. The author is trying to process this and reassess the relationship. Since he's not the one she cheated on, but he's still affected by her past, it's a moral dilemma. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't cheating, but is he in the wrong for valuing fidelity and being upset about her past? If someone values loyalty, it's reasonable for them to have issues with a partner having cheated in the past, even if it wasn't with them. However, some might argue that past actions shouldn't affect current relationships if the person is honest now. \n\nOn the other hand, the act of cheating is a serious matter. The author's reaction is based on his personal values, which is valid. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for considering ending the relationship because his feelings are valid regarding fidelity. However, others might think he's overstepping by being upset about her past when it didn't involve him. But given that he's the current partner and that fidelity is a cornerstone of trust in relationships, his reaction seems justified. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
