We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend's past actions, and he's considering ending the relationship. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend (GF) had a previous relationship with Guy A that lasted three years. He cheated, so she broke up with him. Then she had a brief relationship with Guy B, but it didn't work out, and she got back with Guy A. They got engaged, but later broke up after he wasn't committed. Now, she started a relationship with the author. \n\nBut then the author found out that after breaking up with Guy B, she continued having sex with him for three years while she was with Guy A again. She did this as a way to get back at Guy A for cheating. She claims she didn't have strong feelings for Guy B and wasn't satisfied. \n\nThe author is now conflicted because he values fidelity and can't get past this. He's considering ending the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so, even though he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about the author's right to be upset over his girlfriend's past infidelity. The author is not the one who was cheated on in this past scenario; it was Guy A. However, the author's personal values are important. If he can't accept that his partner was unfaithful in a past relationship, even if he wasn't hurt by it, is that fair?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and fidelity are crucial. If someone's past involves cheating, even in a previous relationship, it might affect the current relationship if one partner can't let it go. But the author is in a new relationship, not involved at the time. So is it his place to hold this against her? \n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in his feelings. If fidelity is a core value for him, he should be with someone who aligns with that. On the other hand, she's already apologized and confessed, and the cheating happened in the past, not in their current relationship. He's not the one who was betrayed. \n\nBut relationships are about mutual respect and values. If he can't accept her past actions despite her being honest about them, maybe it's not fair for him to continue. However, some might argue that using past cheating as a reason to end a current relationship is being in the wrong because the current partner didn't cheat on him. \n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't the one who was cheated on, so technically, he's not the asshole for being upset. His feelings are valid if he can't accept her past behavior. However, others might say he's overreacting because it's old and he wasn't involved. \n\nIn terms of the AITA question, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are justified. Here, the author is considering ending the relationship, which is his right if he can't reconcile his feelings. Since he's not the one who was wronged, but his values are conflicting, it's more a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because he's allowed to have his own standards and feelings about past actions, even if those actions didn't involve him. It's about whether he's willing to accept her past, and that's his decision.\n"
