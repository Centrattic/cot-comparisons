We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after getting back together with him. Now the author is considering ending their relationship because he can't accept that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author isn't the one she cheated on; it was her previous partner. But he's upset because she had an affair in a past relationship. The key question is whether the author has a valid reason to end the relationship based on this past behavior.\n\nThe author mentions valuing fidelity and that he would never have given Guy A a second chance. He's struggling with the fact that she cheated on her ex, even if it was years ago. The girlfriend confessed everything, which is a positive step. She claims she didn't have feelings for Guy B and it was more about revenge. However, the act of cheating itself is a red flag for some people, regardless of the reason.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating in any relationship is generally considered wrong. But since this was in the past, does it affect the current relationship? The author's main issue is trust and values. If fidelity is a core value for him, he might feel betrayed that she didn't maintain that in her past. However, she did confess and is being honest now, which is important for their current relationship.\n\nThe ex's actions (cheating on her) might have contributed to her decision, but that doesn't excuse her behavior. The author has to decide if he can move past this. Since he's not the one cheated on, he might not have the same right to anger as her ex did. However, his feelings about her past actions are valid if they conflict with his own values.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person acting is at fault. Here, the author is considering ending the relationship because of her past. While her actions were wrong in her past, the author isn't at fault for wanting to reassess based on his own values. The girlfriend is in the wrong for cheating on her ex, but the author's decision to leave is a personal choice based on his boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on his values and what he can accept in a partner, even if the cheating was in her past. The focus is on his current relationship and his personal standards.\n"
