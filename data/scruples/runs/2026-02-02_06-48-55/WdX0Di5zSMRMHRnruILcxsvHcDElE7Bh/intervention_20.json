We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy whose girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) for three years after breaking up with another guy (Guy B). Now he's considering ending their relationship because he can't accept that.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that the author (the guy) might be in the wrong because he wasn't the one she cheated on. But I need to think about the situation from both sides. The key points here are about honesty and the impact on the current relationship. \n\nThe girl confessed everything to him upfront, which is important. She's being honest about her past, which aligns with their mutual value of honesty. However, the guy is struggling with the fact that she cheated on her ex. The main question is whether he's justified in ending the relationship because of her past actions with someone else, not with him.\n\nIn relationships, past infidelities can be a red flag for some people because it might indicate a pattern of behavior. The guy is clear that he values fidelity highly and wouldn't have given Guy A a second chance. So even though he isn't the one she cheated on, he's concerned about her past actions affecting his trust in her. \n\nIs he in the wrong for not accepting this? Well, he's not the one she cheated on. She was honest with him, so there's no betrayal in their current relationship. His decision is based on her past, which some might argue is her past and not relevant now. However, if he can't get past it and values fidelity so much that he can't trust her, then his decision to end the relationship is about his own feelings and values. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that her past actions don't impact their current relationship. The fact that she confessed shows she's trustworthy. If he can't accept her past, maybe he's projecting his own expectations onto her. However, if he's decided that he can't be with someone who has a history of infidelity, that's his choice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's making a decision based on his own values and the information she provided, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's judging her harshly for past actions that didn't affect their current relationship, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his reaction is justified. Since he's not the one she cheated on, but he's ending the relationship due to her past, it's more about his personal boundaries. If he can't accept her past, even though she's been honest, then it's his own issue rather than her wrongdoing. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for making that choice. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
