We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend having a complicated past relationship with an ex-boyfriend (Guy A) and a co-worker (Guy B). The main issue is that the author is upset because the girlfriend cheated on Guy A for three years after rekindling their relationship, even though she's not cheating on the author now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The cheating occurred in a past relationship, long before the author and the girlfriend were together. The author wasn't involved in that part of her life, so he wasn't the one she cheated on. The girlfriend confessed this on her own, which shows some level of honesty, which they both value.\n\nThe author is struggling with whether to stay in the relationship because of his strong stance on fidelity. He's reassessing the relationship and considering ending it. The question is if he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The cheating happened in the past, not involving the current relationship. 2) The girlfriend is honest about it. 3) The author's values about fidelity are important to him. \n\nIn many cases, people have different thresholds for what they can accept in a partner's past. While some might argue that past behavior doesn't affect current relationships, others might feel it's a red flag. The author isn't in the situation, so he's not cheating, but his feelings about her past actions are valid. \n\nHowever, ending a relationship over past actions that don't directly harm the current relationship could be seen as holding a grudge. But since fidelity is a core value for the author, and he's communicated this, his decision might be justified from his perspective. The girlfriend isn't cheating on him, but the author's discomfort with her past actions is a personal issue.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because his decision is based on his own values and the fact that her past actions contradict their mutual emphasis on honesty. However, some readers might argue that the past is the past and it's unfair to end a current relationship over it. But given the context, the author's reaction is understandable.\n"
