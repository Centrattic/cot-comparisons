We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault (AITA) because their girlfriend cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) over three years. The main issue here is whether the current boyfriend is wrong for considering ending the relationship because he wasn't the one she cheated on.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The girlfriend is honest and confessed everything. She's in a new relationship now, but her past actions are causing conflict. The current boyfriend is a big on fidelity and can't accept that she cheated on her ex, even though it's in the past. He's considering breaking up because he can't reconcile with that part of her history.\n\nThe key question is whether he's in the wrong for reacting this way. On one hand, the girlfriend hasn't cheated on him, and past actions with an ex might not directly affect the current relationship. People have pasts, and forgiveness can be part of a relationship. On the other hand, trust and values are important. If fidelity is a core value for him, finding out that his partner had such a history could make him feel uneasy, even if it's not against him. \n\nBut is it fair for him to end the relationship over something that happened before they met? The girlfriend was upfront, and he knew about her past relationships initially. He might be projecting his own standards onto her past. However, if he can't accept her past, maybe they aren't compatible. Yet, ending the relationship because he's unable to accept her past actions against a former partner could be seen as holding onto a grudge or being overly judgmental. \n\nAlso, the fact that she cheated on her ex as an act of revenge might affect how he views her integrity. Even if it's in the past, it's a significant part of her history. But he's not the one she hurt in that situation. The ex is. The current boyfriend might be overstepping by using her past to end their relationship, especially since it's not affecting their current relationship directly. However, if he can't move past it, maybe it's a valid reason for him to reassess. \n\nThe community often looks at AITA questions by considering intent and harm. The girlfriend's actions didn't directly harm him, but his reaction is based on his personal values. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is whether he's at fault. If he's choosing to end things because he can't accept her past, that's his decision, but it might not make him the \"wrong\" person. However, some might argue that he's being unfair by not focusing on her current behavior and honesty. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person is considered at fault if they're reacting to something that doesn't directly affect the current relationship. Here, the cheating was against her ex, not him. So maybe he's the one being too harsh. But others might say that trust is a mutual value, and if he can't accept her past, it's a red flag. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because he's prioritizing his values and the relationship requires mutual trust and acceptance. However, others might see it as him being too judgmental. But given the context, his reaction is based on his inability to accept her past, which is a personal choice. So he's not necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, even if the decision to break up is subjective.\n"
