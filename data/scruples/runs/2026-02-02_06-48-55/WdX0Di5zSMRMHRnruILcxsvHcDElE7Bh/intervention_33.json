We\u2019ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn\u2019t feel an investment from Guy B\u2019s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn\u2019t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren\u2019t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn\u2019t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn\u2019t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that\u2019s what she said to me). \n\nI can\u2019t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She\u2019s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she\u2019s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she\u2019s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I\u2019d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I\u2019m a guy big on fidelity, I\u2019ve said to her in the past that I\u2019d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn\u2019t the one she cheated on?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post (which is the person in the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend's past relationship where she cheated on her ex-boyfriend (Guy A) with another guy (Guy B) for three years, even after breaking up with Guy B. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author's girlfriend is the one who cheated on her ex, not on the current partner. The cheating happened in the past, before the author and his girlfriend were together. The girlfriend has confessed, and the current issue is the author's reaction to her past actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. The user thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details given.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, he values fidelity and finds it difficult to understand why his girlfriend would cheat, especially since she claims she still loved Guy A. He's upset that she continued the affair for three years, even after ending the relationship with Guy B. He's also conflicted because he believes her when she says it was in the past and that she came clean.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't cheat on the current relationship. The cheating was with her ex, which might be considered a past matter. The author is now holding her past against her, which could be seen as unfair, especially since he wasn't the one she cheated on. The fact that she confessed shows honesty, which aligns with their mutual value of honesty in the relationship.\n\nBut the author's main issue is not about current infidelity but past actions. The question is whether past actions in a previous relationship should affect the current relationship. The author isn't being unfaithful to his girlfriend; he's reacting to her past. This could be a matter of personal boundaries. If fidelity is a core value for the author, he might have a hard time moving past it, but it's not a betrayal in the current relationship.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that the girlfriend's actions were in the past and that she has been transparent about it. The author is choosing to end the relationship based on her past, which might not be fair. The fact that he's taking time to reassess and is trying to understand her perspective shows he's not acting impulsively. But if he can't accept her past, even though it doesn't affect their current relationship, then maybe he's overstepping. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, people are often criticized when they hold past actions against someone in a current relationship, especially if those actions didn't directly harm the current partner. However, if one's values fundamentally clash with past actions, it's reasonable to question compatibility.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author has a valid reason to be upset. Since the cheating was in a different relationship and the girlfriend was honest about it, the author's reaction might be seen as him being in the right if he values fidelity above all else, or in the wrong for holding past actions against her. But I think the general consensus might lean towards the author being in the right because he's standing by his values, even if it's a tough decision. However, others might argue that her past shouldn't affect their current relationship. But given that the cheating wasn't towards him, some might say he's overreacting. I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check the details again.\n\nThe key points: The cheating was in the past, not with the current partner. She confessed. The author is considering ending the relationship because he can't accept her past actions. The question is whether he's at fault. Some might say he's not because he's staying true to his values, others might say he's wrong for not being able to move past her history. In AITA posts, people are often not at fault when they end relationships over infidelity, but this is past infidelity towards someone else. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
