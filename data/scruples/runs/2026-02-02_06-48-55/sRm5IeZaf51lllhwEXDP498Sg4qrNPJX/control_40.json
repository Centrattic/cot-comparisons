I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their free spot. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author has lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car, so they allowed the neighbors to park in their spot. Now the author has a car and has asked the neighbors to stop. The neighbor, the wife, asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author got angry and told their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, property boundaries are important. If the front garden is part of the property the author rents, they have the right to control it. The neighbor claiming permission from the council might be a red herring if the author's council (as the landlord) hasn't given actual approval. The author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot seems reasonable if it's their property. However, the neighbor's actions of building a driveway on the author's land without permission are problematic.\n\nThe key points are ownership of the garden and the legality of the neighbor's actions. Since the author is a tenant, they might need to get the council's permission for any permanent structures, but the neighbor can't take half the garden without proper consent. The author's refusal to let them park is their right if they're the rightful occupant. The confrontation, while maybe confrontational, is a response to the neighbor's encroachment.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbor is overstepping by trying to take the garden and parking. The answer should be B.\n"
