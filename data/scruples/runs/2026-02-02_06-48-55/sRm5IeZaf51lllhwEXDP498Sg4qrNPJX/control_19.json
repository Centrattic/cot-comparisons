I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking spots and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway. The author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they do have a car, they're refusing. Then there's the part where the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden, which the author doesn't own since it's a rented house from the council.\n\nFirst, the parking issue. The author allowed the neighbors to park there without charge for a long time. Now they want to stop. If the parking spot is part of the author's property, even if it's rented, they have the right to control who uses it, right? Unless there's some sort of agreement or understanding that the neighbors could park there permanently. But the author didn't formalize that, so maybe they can change their mind. But since the neighbors were using it for years, maybe they could argue they had an implied permission. But the author is the one who owns the property (the house is owned by the council, but the garden is part of the property). So the author should have the right to revoke that access. But maybe the neighbors could claim adverse possession? Not sure how that works in the UK. But the author is a tenant, so maybe the council would have to deal with that.\n\nThen there's the driveway issue. The neighbor says the council gave her permission to build a driveway taking up part of the author's garden. The author says they don't consent. Since the house is owned by the council, the author doesn't own the garden, so any changes to the property would need the council's approval. But if the council did give permission, maybe the neighbor is within her rights. However, the author is the tenant, so maybe they can object if it affects their use of the property. But the neighbor might have a valid permit from the council. The author's response was to have a car parked there to block the neighbor, leading to a confrontation. \n\nSo, the author is acting to protect their own interest, but if the council has already given permission for the driveway, the author might not have standing to block it. But since the author is a tenant, they might need to go through the council to address these issues. The author's actions in parking their brother's car might be seen as reasonable to assert their right to the spot, but if the neighbor has a permit, that's a different matter. \n\nIn terms of the parking spot, the author can change their mind about letting others park there. The neighbor's use might not be legally protected unless there's a formal agreement. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping the parking. However, the driveway issue is more complicated. If the council approved it, the author might not have the right to block it, but they can still raise concerns with the council. The author's response to the driveway (using their brother's car) might not be the best approach, but the core issue is whether they have the right to the parking and garden. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their rights to the property they have a lease on. They can revoke the parking access and object to the driveway, but maybe the proper way is to contact the council. The immediate actions might be a bit confrontational, but the underlying rights seem to be on the author's side. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
