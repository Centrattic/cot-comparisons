I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their parking spot.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author initially allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now, the author has a brother park there, and the neighbor is upset. Also, the neighbor wants to build a driveway on half of the author's garden, claiming council permission.\n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and permissions matter. Since the author is a renter, the council owns the house. If the front garden is part of the property, the council might have control over it. The neighbor claiming council permission is a key point. If the council approved the driveway, the author might not have the right to stop it, but if they didn't, the neighbor is acting improperly.\n\nRegarding the parking spot: If it's a designated spot on the author's property, they have the right to control it. Allowing parking for years could be seen as a tacit agreement, but once the author decides to stop, they can do so. However, the neighbor using it for years might have assumed it was okay, so the sudden refusal could be seen as abrupt. The author's act of having their brother park there might be seen as reclaiming their right, but if it was a shared space or there was an informal agreement, maybe the author should have communicated better.\n\nThe key issue is whether the parking spot is private or part of a shared area. If the author's spot is private, they can refuse parking. If the council's rules or lease agreement allows the neighbor to park there, the author might be in the wrong. But since the author is a renter, they need to check their lease terms. If the council is involved, the author might need their permission to park or not park there.\n\nThe neighbor wanting to build a driveway on the author's garden is more serious. If the council didn't give proper permission, the neighbor is acting illegally. The author should involve the council to resolve this. The author's anger and sudden action might be justified if the neighbor was indeed overstepping.\n\nOverall, the author's actions might be justified if the parking spot is their private property and the neighbor's use was without proper permission. However, the sudden refusal without prior communication might be problematic. The driveway issue is separate and needs council intervention. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation depends on property rights and council policies.\n"
