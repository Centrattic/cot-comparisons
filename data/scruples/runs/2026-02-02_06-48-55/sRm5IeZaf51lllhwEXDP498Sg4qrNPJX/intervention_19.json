I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking spots and a neighbor wanting to take part of their garden for a driveway. The user is the author, and they've been letting their neighbors park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now they do, and they've told the neighbors to stop. The neighbor (the wife) then asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Now the wife is trying to build a driveway on the author's property without permission, even though the author doesn't own the house and rents from the council.\n\nFirst, the author didn't own the property, so they can't actually give permission for the neighbor to take part of their garden. But the neighbor claims the council gave permission. The author is upset and took a confrontational approach by having their brother park there, leading to an argument with the neighbor. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on facts.\n\nIn the UK, council-owned properties mean the council owns the land, so the tenant might not have ownership rights. If the council approved the driveway, maybe the neighbor is within their rights. But the author's garden could be part of their tenancy. Also, the neighbor was using the author's parking spot without permission. The author initially allowed it when they had no car, but now they need to use it. The neighbor might be in the wrong if they're building without proper permission. However, the author's response was to block the spot with their brother, which is aggressive. \n\nPossible issues: The author doesn't own the property, so they might not have the right to grant or deny parking. Also, if the council did approve the driveway, the neighbor might be following council rules. But the author's garden is their own space unless the council allowed the neighbor to take part. The author's confrontation could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. The neighbor might have a valid claim if the council approved, but the author is trying to block them. Alternatively, the neighbor might not have the right if the council didn't actually approve, which the author is trying to verify by calling the council.\n\nThe key points are: ownership rights, council permissions, and how the author handled the conflict. The author might not be in the wrong if the neighbor is overstepping without proper authority. But using a brother to park and confront the neighbor could be seen as aggressive. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author is justified in protecting their space, especially if the neighbor is encroaching without proper approval. However, the initial parking permission wasn't formal, so the neighbor's use might be without legal right. The author's action to stop them could be justified, but the method might be questionable. However, since the author is a tenant, they might not have the authority to enforce parking rules. \n\nOverall, it depends on whether the neighbor has legal permission from the council. If not, the author is protecting their property. If so, the author is interfering with council-approved plans. But the user's brother parking there could be a problem if it's a public space or if the council has different rules. The answer might hinge on ownership and permissions. Given that the author is a tenant, they should check with the council, but their immediate action might be understandable in the heat of the moment. However, the method of using a brother to park and confront could be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong if the neighbor is acting without proper authorization, but their approach might be aggressive. The answer could be B, as the author is defending their rights, especially if the neighbor is encroaching without permission.\n"
