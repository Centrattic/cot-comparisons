I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a parking spot that they've allowed their neighbors to use for years, especially since they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor wants to build a driveway on part of the author's front garden. The author says they don't own the house; it's rented from the council. The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author hasn't consented. \n\nThe author then tells their brother to park in the spot to block the neighbors, leading to a confrontation. The main issue is whether the author acted wrongly in refusing the neighbor's parking and in blocking it with their brother.\n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and rights about parking can be tricky. Since the author rents, they might not have the same rights as an owner. The neighbor might have some claim if the council approved the driveway, but the author's refusal isn't parking in their spot. However, the author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot could be problematic if the space is considered part of the council's property. Also, the neighbor's family has been using the spot for years, maybe creating a prescriptive right, but that's complicated.\n\nThe author's anger and blocking the spot could be seen as reactive. If the neighbor actually has council permission, the author might be interfering with a legal process. But if the author's garden is part of their tenancy, the council's approval might not override that. It's unclear if the author's action is justified. Legally, the author might be in the right if the council didn't grant valid permission, but if they did, the author could be in the wrong. However, the neighbor's entitlement and prior use also play a role. The author's response seems like a stand-up for their property, but the method might be questionable. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since they're protecting their property, even if the neighbor claims approval. But maybe there's a procedural issue if the author should have gone through the council instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
