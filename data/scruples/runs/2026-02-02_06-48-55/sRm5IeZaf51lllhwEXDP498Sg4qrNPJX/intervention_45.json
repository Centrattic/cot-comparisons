I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author lived in the house for 18 years and allowed their neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago, and initially, there was no issue. So the author was generous, letting the neighbors use the spot for years. \n\nThen, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the author's front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The wife stopped greeting them, but the family still used the parking spot. Now, the wife is claiming permission from the council to build a driveway on half of the author's garden, but the author doesn't consent. The author then tells their brother to park there, leading to the husband yelling at the brother, and the author cutting off the neighbors from using the spot.\n\nI need to consider UK property laws. In the UK, if you're a tenant, you don't own the property, so any permanent changes like building a driveway would typically need the landlord's consent. The council, being the landlord, would have authority. But the neighbor is claiming the council gave permission. If that's the case, maybe the author's garden isn't entirely their own. However, the author might have been using the space as a parking spot, but if the council allows the neighbor to build a driveway, that could conflict.\n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to prevent the neighbor from using the spot could be seen as a preemptive move. But if the neighbor has council permission, the author might be blocking a legal project. However, the author might not have been informed of that permission yet, and the council's approval doesn't negate the author's rights unless it's official.\n\nAlso, the author's initial generosity might have created an expectation for the neighbors, but once the author decided to stop, it's their right to do so. However, the neighbor's request for building a driveway might require addressing through official channels. The author's response of using their brother's car could be seen as a confrontational move rather than a legal one.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for not allowing parking anymore? Since they were the ones who initially allowed it but now are revoking it, maybe they are within their rights. But if the neighbor has legal permissions, maybe the author is interfering. However, the author is a tenant, so maybe the council's decision here is key. If the council permits the neighbor to build, the author can't prevent that. But if the council hasn't finalized it, the author might still have a right to object.\n\nIn terms of parking, if the spot is on the author's rented property (even if it's part of the council's land), the author might have the right to control access unless the council has different rules. The neighbor using the spot without permission could be a separate issue. The author's action of parking there might be asserting their right, but it depends on whether the spot is legally theirs to control.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong if they have the right to the parking spot and the neighbor doesn't have legal permission yet. However, if the neighbor's building project is approved, the author might need to let that happen. The immediate issue is about parking, where the author is reclaiming their spot, which they are entitled to do. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
