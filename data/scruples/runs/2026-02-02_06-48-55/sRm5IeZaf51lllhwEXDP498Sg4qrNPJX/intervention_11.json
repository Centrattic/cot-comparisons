I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their free spot. Let me go through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting their neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. The neighbors have four cars, so the author's spot was being used. Then, the wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The wife stopped greeting them after that. The author mentions that the family kept using the parking spot even after this.\n\nThen, the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's front garden, claiming the council gave her permission. The author didn't consent and called their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation with the husband. The author is now planning to contact the council about the driveway issue.\n\nNow, the key points here are about property rights and previous agreements. In the UK, if the author is a tenant, the council (the landlord) owns the house and the surrounding land. So, any changes to the property, like adding a driveway, would require the council's permission. The author's ability to allow or deny parking might depend on their tenant's rights. If the author has been allowing the neighbors to park there for years, maybe there's an implied agreement. However, since the author is a tenant, the council might have the final say on any land use changes. \n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there to prevent the neighbors from using it could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. If the neighbors were using the spot without permission from the council, the author might have the right to stop them. But if the council has given permission for the driveway, the author's refusal could complicate things. However, the author didn't consent, and the neighbor's claim of council permission might be false or not valid without the author's consent if the garden is part of the tenancy.\n\nThe author's main issue is the neighbor's entitlement to take over their property. By getting their brother to park there, the author is asserting their right to their property. However, if the council owns the land, the author might not have the legal authority to deny parking. But since they've been allowing it for years, maybe they've been acting as if they have control. The neighbor's attempt to build a driveway on the author's garden without consent is a separate issue, and the author is right to involve the council.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified in protecting their property, especially if the council hasn't given permission to the neighbor. The initial allowing of parking might have created an expectation, but the author could have the right to revoke it. The key is whether the author has the legal right to control the parking spot. If the author is a tenant, the council's rules would matter. But since they've been using the spot for parking, maybe they have a de facto right. The neighbor's attempt to take over the garden is another issue, and the author is right to object.\n\nIn terms of the parking spot refusal, if the author has the right to control that space (even as a tenant), then they aren't in the wrong. The neighbor using it without permission might not be allowed. However, if the council owns the property and the author doesn't have the authority to restrict parking, then the author might be in the wrong. But given the context, the author seems to have been managing the space as their own, so their refusal is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
