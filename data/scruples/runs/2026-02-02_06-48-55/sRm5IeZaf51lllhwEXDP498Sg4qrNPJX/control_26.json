I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their free spot. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author has been living in the house for 18 years. The neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author didn't mind the neighbor parking in their spot because they had no car. Then the neighbor's wife asked to build a porch on half the front garden, which the author refused. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the same space, claiming the council allowed it. The author told their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the author's spot: since they rent, the ownership of the garden (front or back) is important. In the UK, if the property is rented, the council (as the landlord) owns the house and possibly the garden. If the neighbor is allowed by the council to take half the garden, that might be a problem. But the author might not have the right to object if the council permits it. However, the author's spot was their own, even if they rent. Wait, but if the garden is part of the property, and the council owns the house, maybe the garden is also owned by the council. So, if the neighbor got permission from the council to use that space, the author might not have the authority to stop them.\n\nBut the author is now telling their brother to park there, which could be seen as taking a stand. The neighbor's family had been using the spot for years, and after the author said no to the porch, the wife stopped greeting them. Now the author is asserting their right by parking there. However, if the neighbor had prior permission from the council, maybe the author is overstepping. But the author might not have been aware of the council's permission. The key here is whether the author has the legal right to that parking spot and the garden. Since they are a tenant, their rights are limited to what the landlord (council) allows. If the neighbor got the council's approval to build a driveway on the garden, the author might not have the right to block that. But the parking spot was free, and the author is now using it. The neighbor's family might have assumed it was a shared space, but the author is reclaiming it. \n\nAlso, in the UK, parking rights can be tricky. If the parking spot is part of the rental property, the tenant has the right to use it. If the neighbor was parking there without permission, that's an issue. But the author allowed it for years. Now, the neighbor is trying to take over part of the garden. The author is standing up for their own space, which they might not own, but the council does. So if the neighbor is building a driveway on the council's land without the author's consent, the author should contact the council. But the author's action of parking there themselves might not be wrong if they are asserting their right to use the space as a tenant. \n\nThe neighbor's family using the spot for years might imply implied permission. But the author could revoke that permission at any time. However, the driveway issue is separate. If the council allowed the neighbor to take half the garden, the author's spot might be affected. The author is now parking there to prevent the neighbor from using it, which could be a conflict. The author's main mistake might be not clarifying the ownership of the garden and parking spot with the council. But the act of parking in their own spot isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for using their own parking spot. The neighbor's entitlement to build a driveway on the garden is a separate legal matter that the author should handle by contacting the council. The author's actions are self-protective and timely. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
