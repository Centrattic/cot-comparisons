I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their free spot. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now they do, so they're reclaiming the spot. The author mentions they rent the house, not own it, which is important. The council owns the property, so maybe there are rules about using the garden. \n\nThe neighbor wanted to take half the garden for a driveway, which the author didn't agree to. The council is involved here, so if the council gave permission, that might override the author's say. But the author is contesting that. \n\nThe key points: The author allowed parking for years, but now they need the spot. The neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's garden. The author parked their brother's car to block the neighbor from parking. \n\nIn the UK, parking rights can be tricky. If the spot is on the author's private property, they can control who parks there. But if the garden is part of the council's property, maybe the neighbor has a claim if the council approved it. However, the author is a tenant, so maybe they can't make decisions about the property. \n\nThe act of parking the brother's car might be seen as a stand against the neighbor's actions, but if the council hasn't officially given permission, the author might have a point. On the other hand, if the council did approve, the author might need to follow that. \n\nThe neighbor's family using the spot without the author's current consent could be an issue. But the author was generous for years, so suddenly changing the arrangement might be seen as unfair. However, the author's rights as a tenant need to be considered. \n\nIn terms of the driveway, if the council has approved it, the author might not have the authority to stop it, especially since they don't own the house. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified in reclaiming their spot, but if the council's approval is valid, there's a problem. The act of parking the brother's car could be seen as aggressive. Legally, if the spot is theirs, they can park there. But the neighbor's actions might be separate. \n\nOverall, the author might have a valid point in stopping their own spot from being taken, but the way they handled it (parking brother's car) might not be the best approach. However, if the council is involved, the author needs to go through proper channels. The answer depends on whether the author's spot is truly their private property or part of the council's land. If it's private, then they are in the right. If not, maybe not. But given the info, the author is likely in the right to protect their own space.\n"
