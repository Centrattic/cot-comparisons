I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their free spot. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nSo, the author has been living in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in about 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now, the author has a brother's car parking there. The neighbor's wife asked for half the garden to build a porch, which the author refused. Then the wife stopped greeting them. The neighbor family continued using the parking spot despite the refusal. Now, the wife is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden, which the council supposedly approved. The author confronted her and then called their brother to park the car, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider UK property laws. Since the author is a tenant, they don't own the house; the council does. The front garden is part of the property, so even as a tenant, the author might have some rights to it. The neighbor claiming permission from the council to take half the garden could be valid if the council approved it, but the author might not agree. However, the author's refusal to let the neighbor park in the spot now might be an issue because if the neighbor is allowed by the council, but the author is the tenant, there's a conflict between tenant rights and landlord (council) permissions.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. The author allowed parking in the past but now refuses. Is there an implied permission or agreement that the neighbors relied on?\n2. The neighbor is trying to alter the property (building a driveway) with council permission. If the council approved it, maybe the author doesn't have legal standing to block it since they're a tenant.\n3. The author's response of having a brother park there to prevent the neighbors from using the spot might be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which could be problematic.\n\nIn the UK, tenants usually can't make structural changes to the property without the landlord's consent. If the council approved the driveway, maybe the author can't prevent that. However, the parking spot is a different issue. If the parking spot is part of the property, the tenant might have exclusive rights to it. But if the neighbors were using it under some prior arrangement, the sudden refusal could cause issues. The author's use of a family member to park there might be a form of self-help, which isn't advisable legally.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's request to modify the garden with council approval might be a separate matter. The author should probably contact the council to clarify their rights as a tenant regarding both the parking and the proposed driveway. The author's confrontation and using a brother to park there might be seen as escalatory and not the proper way to handle it.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue through proper channels and for using a confrontational method. However, if the parking spot is indeed the author's to control, then they have the right to refuse. But the driveway issue is more complex with the council's involvement. The answer might depend on whether the author had any prior agreements with the council about the parking spot and the garden.\n"
