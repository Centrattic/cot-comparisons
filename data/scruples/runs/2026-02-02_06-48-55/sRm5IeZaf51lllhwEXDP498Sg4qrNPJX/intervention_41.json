I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about parking disputes and unauthorized construction between neighbors.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has allowed the neighbor to park in their spot for years, especially when they didn't have a car. The neighbor then asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor now claims the council has allowed her to build a driveway on the author's property, which the author opposes. The author then gets their brother to park in the spot to block the neighbor, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Legally, if the property is rented from the council, the author doesn't own the house, so the council's permissions matter. The neighbor claiming permission from the council could be a factor. If the council actually approved the neighbor's request, the author might not have a legal leg to stand on. However, if the neighbor didn't have proper permission or the author wasn't consulted, that's another issue.\n\nEthically, the author allowed parking for years, so suddenly blocking it might be seen as unfair. The neighbor's family used the spot for years without issue, so the author changing the policy now could be seen as selfish. However, the neighbor trying to build on the author's property without consent is definitely problematic. The author stopping the parking is a way to prevent that, but using a friend to park there might be seen as aggressive.\n\nIn the UK, planning laws and property rights are strict. If the neighbor has proper planning permission, the author's actions could be in violation. The author's response of parking there to block the neighbor might be considered a civil matter, but if the neighbor has legal rights, the author is in the wrong. Also, the author's approach to confrontation might be seen as hostile.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's refusal to allow parking after allowing it for years could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there's no legal claim to restrict it. If the neighbor has council approval, the author's actions might be legally and ethically wrong. However, if the neighbor hasn't obtained proper permission, the author is protecting their rights. But since the author is a tenant, the council's stance is crucial. The answer hinges on whether the neighbor's construction is legally permitted. If it's not, the author is justified. If it is, the author is wrong. The story mentions the neighbor claims council permission, but the author hasn't confirmed it. Given that, the author acting without verifying the neighbor's permits might be in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
