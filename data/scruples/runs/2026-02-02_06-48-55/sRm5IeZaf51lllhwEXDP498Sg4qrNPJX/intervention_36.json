I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves neighbors using the author's parking spot and then trying to build a driveway on their property.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they had no car. The neighbors have four cars, so maybe they needed the space. The author didn't charge them, which seems generous.\n\nThen the wife asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbors stopped greeting the author after that. The author notes that the family still used the parking spot. Now, the wife claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway taking up half the author's garden. The author refuses again and calls their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are about property rights. The author rents the house, so the council owns it. If the neighbors have permission from the council to build a driveway, even if it's on the author's rented property, the council's approval might override the tenant's objections. But wait, if the author is a tenant, they might not have the right to object unless the lease allows it. The author is a tenant, so the council's permission could be valid. However, if the driveway encroaches on the author's private front garden, the tenant might have some rights even though they don't own the house. But the council owns the house, so they can make changes as long as it's legal.\n\nThe author's actions of calling their brother to park there might be seen as a confrontation. The neighbors were using the spot for years, but the author now wants to stop them. If the neighbors have permission from the council, the author's refusal might be against that. The author's anger and using their brother to park could be seen as aggressive. But if the author's front garden is part of the rented property, maybe the author can use it as their own space. However, if the council approved the driveway, they might have the right to proceed. The author's main issue is the neighbor's entitlement and the confrontation. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's action of parking there to block them could be seen as in the wrong, especially if the council's permission is valid. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
