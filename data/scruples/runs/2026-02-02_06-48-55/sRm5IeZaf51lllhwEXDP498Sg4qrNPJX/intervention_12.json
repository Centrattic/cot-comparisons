I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. The situation involves the neighbor wanting to build a driveway on half of the author's garden, and the author taking action by having their brother park there.\n\nFirst, the author lives in the UK and rents the house. The neighbor has been using the author's parking spot for years because the author didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor is trying to take half the garden for a driveway, which the author refuses. The author then has their brother park there to prevent the neighbor's family from parking there anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are property rights and the concept of adverse possession. Since the author rents the house, the council owns it. The neighbor might not have a legal right to park there. However, if the neighbor has been using the spot for years, there might be a claim of adverse possession. But since the author didn't know about adverse possession and allowed parking for years, maybe they lost the right to revoke it? \n\nAlso, the author's action of parking their brother's car to prevent the neighbor from parking could be seen as obstructing the neighbor's claimed right if adverse possession applies. But since the author is a tenant, the council's permission is crucial. The neighbor might be trying to take the garden without the author's consent, which is a breach of the lease agreement. The author has the right to complain to the council about unauthorized construction. \n\nThe author's refusal to let the neighbor park now could be justified if the neighbor's use was without permission. But if the neighbor's use over years created a legal claim, the author might be in the wrong. However, since the author is a tenant, the council's stance is important. The author's action to park their brother's car might escalate the conflict but could be seen as defending their property rights. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be a reaction to protect their property from unauthorized use. The neighbor's entitlement to the space is questionable, especially since the author is a tenant. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting their rights, even if the neighbor's actions could be seen as entitled. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
