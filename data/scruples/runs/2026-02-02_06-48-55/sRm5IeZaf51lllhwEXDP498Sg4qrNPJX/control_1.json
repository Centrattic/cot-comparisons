I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person has lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, they allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. The neighbors have four cars, which might be relevant because parking space might be limited. \n\nThen, the wife asked to take half of the front garden to build a porch, which was refused. After that, the neighbor stopped greeting them, but the family kept using the parking spot. The user didn't object then. Now, the neighbor claims the council approved building a driveway on half of the user's property, but the user didn't consent. The user then had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, property rights can be a bit complex. Since the house is rented and owned by the council, the user's rights might be limited. The user is a tenant, so any modifications or permissions would typically require the landlord's consent. The neighbor might need the council's approval to build on the property. However, if the parking spot is part of the user's tenancy agreement, they might have the right to control it. \n\nThe user allowed parking for years, which could be seen as a mutual informal agreement. When they decided to stop, they had their brother park there, which the neighbor found intrusive. The user's action here might be seen as reclaiming their spot, but since they allowed it for years, the neighbor might feel entitled. However, the user has the right to change their mind. \n\nThe main issues are: 1) The user's rights over the property they're renting. If the front garden is part of their rented space, the council can't just allow another tenant to take it. 2) The parking spot's ownership. If it's part of the user's property, they can decide who parks there. The user's action of parking their brother's car is enforcing their right. \n\nBut the neighbor claiming council permission is tricky. If the council approved it, the user should contact the council to resolve it. The user's response to the driveway issue is to involve the council, which is appropriate. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping the parking, especially after the neighbor's request for the garden was denied. The user isn't obligated to let others park there indefinitely without their consent. However, the way they handled it with their brother might have been confrontational, but the core issue is about property rights. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to let the neighbors park after changing their mind.\n"
