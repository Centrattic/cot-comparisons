I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor has been parking in their spot for years, but the author is now refusing. The neighbor also tried to take half the garden for a driveway without permission. The author confronted them and had their brother park there to block it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property laws in the UK. The author mentions they rent the house, so they don't own it. The council owns it. So any changes to the property, like building a driveway, would typically require permission from the council. The neighbor says they have permission, but the author doesn't consent. But if the council approved it, maybe the neighbor is right. But the author is objecting, thinking they have the right to decline? Or maybe not.\n\nAlso, about the parking spot. If the author is the one who let the neighbor park there for years, even before moving in, then maybe there's something like a \"prescriptive easement\" or something similar. But since the author is a tenant, maybe the landlord (council) would handle parking rights. If the parking spot is part of the property, the council might decide who can park there. The author just letting them park for years could be seen as giving permission, but if there's no formal agreement, maybe the author can revoke it.\n\nThen there's the neighbor trying to take half the garden. The author doesn't own the house, so they can't unilaterally stop that. The council would have to make decisions here. So the author taking action by parking there themselves might be an issue. But they did call the council to sort it out.\n\nThe author's actions: stopping the neighbor from parking now could be justified if the parking spot isn't the neighbor's. But if the neighbor has a right to park there, the author might be in the wrong. However, the author's brother parking there to block the driveway could be seen as a bit of an overreaction or a way to assert control, but maybe justifiable if the author feels they're protecting their property.\n\nIn terms of the driveway, the neighbor claims council approval, but the author didn't consent. If the council allowed it without the author's input, maybe the author is within their rights to challenge it, especially since they're the tenant. But the author can't legally stop the neighbor from building if the council approved it. So the author's actions here might be more about trying to assert control rather than legally stopping it.\n\nPutting it all together: The author allowed parking for years, then changed their mind. The neighbor might have a right to park there if it's part of the property arrangement. The author's use of a brother to park there could be seen as aggressive. However, the author is also trying to protect their property from unauthorized construction. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author is in the right in standing up for their property, even if some actions are a bit confrontational. But legally, if the parking spot is part of the property and the neighbor isn't the tenant, the author might have the right to revoke the parking privilege. However, if the neighbor had a right to park there based on prior use, the author might be in the wrong. Since the author didn't own the house, their authority over the property is limited, so maybe they shouldn't have used a family member to block the spot. But the neighbor's actions are also problematic. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were protecting their property, but their methods might be questionable. However, the answer would depend on whether the author had the right to control the parking spot. If the spot is part of the property the author rents, then they might have the right to ask for it back. If it's just a shared space, maybe not. Given the UK context, maybe the author is within their rights to ask for the parking spot back, especially since they're the current tenant. So perhaps the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
