I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor parking in their spot and then a conflict over building a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park there for years when they didn't have a car. Now they do have a car, so they want the spot back. But the neighbor is claiming the council gave permission to take part of the front garden. The author's property is rented, so they might not have ownership rights. \n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and permissions can be tricky. If the garden is part of the author's rented property, then the neighbor can't just take it without the landlord's consent, especially if the council owns the house. But if the council gave permission, maybe there's a legal aspect here. \n\nThe author told their brother to park there to block the neighbor, which led to confrontation. Whether that's right depends on the actual ownership of the parking spot and the garden. If the parking spot is part of the author's property, they have the right to use it. But if the neighbor was using it informally, maybe without a legal agreement, the author can change that now. \n\nThe key points: Does the author have the right to the parking spot? Is the neighbor's use based on an implied agreement or trespassing? Also, the driveway issue\u2014can the council permit part of someone else's garden? The author might be in the right to assert their rights, especially since they're the one who rents the property. However, acting unilaterally by parking to block might not be the best approach legally. \n\nBut the main question is about being in the wrong. If the author's property rights are valid, then they aren't in the wrong. The neighbor's actions might be the issue. So the answer is B (No).\n"
