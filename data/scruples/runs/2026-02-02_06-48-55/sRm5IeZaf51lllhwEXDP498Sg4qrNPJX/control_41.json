I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a neighbor trying to take over part of the author's garden and parking spot. The author has been allowing the neighbor's family to park in their spot for years while they didn't have a car. Now that the author's brother is using the spot, the neighbor is upset.\n\nFirst, the author is a renter, not the house owner. The council owns the house. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden. The author didn't consent to that. The neighbor also stopped greeting the author after a previous refusal about a porch. \n\nThe key points here are ownership and permission. Since the author is renting, they might not have legal ownership of the garden. If the council owns the house and garden, then maybe the neighbor needs permission from the council, not just the current tenant. But if the neighbor got council approval, that might be a factor. However, the author might not be able to stop the neighbor if the council approved it. But maybe the neighbor didn't get proper permission or is misrepresenting it.\n\nAlso, about the parking spot. If the parking space is part of the property the author is renting, then they have the right to use it as per their tenancy agreement. Allowing others to park there might be against the rules if the tenant isn't supposed to sublet parking. But if the author was just being kind before and now wants to stop, that's their right. The neighbor's family using it without permission could be an issue, but since the author allowed it before, maybe there's an implied permission. However, once the author decides to revoke that, they can. \n\nThe author's brother parking there might be a problem if the tenant isn't allowed to park there themselves, but since the author is the tenant, they can let their family park there. The neighbor's reaction might be because they had an expectation based on past behavior, but the author isn't obligated to continue allowing that. \n\nAs for the driveway issue, if the neighbor has council approval, the author might need to involve the council to resolve it. The author's brother parking there could be a way to assert their right to the space. But if the council says the neighbor can build the driveway despite the author's objection, the author might lose that part. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for their property rights as a tenant. Even though they are renting, the council's ownership might mean they have rights to the space as per their tenancy agreement. The neighbor's actions in trying to take over the garden without consent are problematic. The author's actions in revoking parking access after years might be their right, especially if the neighbor was using it without proper permission all along. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are trying to assert their rights after being taken advantage of. The neighbor's entitlement and lack of proper permissions are the issues here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
