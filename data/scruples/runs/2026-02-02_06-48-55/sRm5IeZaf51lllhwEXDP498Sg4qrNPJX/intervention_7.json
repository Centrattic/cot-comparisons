I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves parking spots and a dispute over property. \n\nFirst, the author has been letting their neighbor park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now, they do have a car, so they're taking it back. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which was denied. Then the neighbor claims the council gave permission to build a driveway on the author's garden. The author then tells their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, if the house is rented and owned by the council, the garden might be considered part of the property, but the council's permission could be key. The author's rights depend on the lease agreement. If the council didn't agree to let the neighbor use the garden, the author can't just let the neighbor take it. But the author had been allowing parking for years, which might imply some informal agreement. \n\nThe key point is whether the author has the right to the parking spot. If the spot is part of their rented property, then they can use it as they see fit. But the neighbor's claim about council permission needs to be checked. The author's action of having their brother park there might escalate the conflict. However, if the author is reclaiming their own space, they might not be in the wrong. The neighbor's entitlement to the garden without the author's consent is problematic. \n\nThe author's anger is justified if the neighbor is encroaching without proper approval. However, the author might need to check with the council to confirm their rights. The main issue is whether the author's use of the spot is legitimate and if the neighbor has valid permission. The author's action to reassert their space could be in their right, depending on the property's ownership and lease terms.\n"
