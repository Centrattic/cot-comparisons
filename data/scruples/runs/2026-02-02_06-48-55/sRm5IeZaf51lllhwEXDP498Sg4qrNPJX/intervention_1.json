I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about parking rights and property boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions renting the house, so ownership is with the council. The neighbor wants to build a driveway on part of the author's garden. The author didn't consent, which is important. The neighbor claims the council gave permission. If that's true, the author might not have the right to stop the construction. But the author is still trying to call the council to object, which makes sense because they don't own the property.\n\nThen there's the parking issue. The author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot for years while they had no car. Now that the author has a brother who can park there, they refuse. The question is whether the parking spot is actually the author's. If it's a public street or shared space, maybe the author can't unilaterally decide who parks where. However, if the spot is considered part of the author's property (like a driveway or allocated space), then they might have a right to control it. \n\nThe neighbor's family using the spot without permission might be an issue. If the author wasn't the rightful owner, but had been allowing them, maybe there was an informal agreement. Now the author is changing the terms. The brother parking there could be seen as enforcing the author's claim, but if the spot isn't legally theirs, that might be problematic.\n\nThe author's actions in having the brother park there to prevent the neighbors from using it could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The husband's reaction is understandable if they thought they had a right to park there. The author's anger at the neighbor's entitlement and the driveway plans is valid, but the way they're handling it might be aggressive.\n\nConsidering UK property laws, if the garden is part of the rented property, the author doesn't own it. The neighbor getting permission from the council might be legitimate, but the author has a right to object as they're the tenant. However, the tenant's rights might be limited compared to the council's decisions. \n\nIn terms of parking, if the spot isn't officially assigned to the author, they can't control who parks there. The author might have been assuming it was their spot informally but can't enforce it legally. The brother parking there could lead to conflict if others have been using it. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate now that they have a car, especially after allowing the neighbors for years. Their response to the driveway issue is proactive, but the method of having someone park there could be confrontational. Overall, the neighbor's entitlement is questionable, but the author's approach might have contributed to the conflict.\n"
