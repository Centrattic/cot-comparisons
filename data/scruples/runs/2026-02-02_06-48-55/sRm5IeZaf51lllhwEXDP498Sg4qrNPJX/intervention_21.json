I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car, so they allowed the neighbors to park in their spot. Now, the author has a brother with a car who parks there. The neighbor, the wife, asked to build a porch on half the front garden, which the author refused. Then the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author called their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the main issues are about property rights and usage. Since the author is a renter, the property belongs to the council. The neighbor is trying to encroach onto the author's garden. The author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbors might be a problem if the parking spot isn't legally theirs. But if the council owns the house, maybe the author doesn't actually own the parking spot. However, the neighbors were already using it without permission. \n\nThe neighbor's actions, like building a driveway without consent, are definitely problematic. The author is trying to assert their rights. But when the author told the neighbors they couldn't park there anymore, maybe they overstepped if the spot isn't legally theirs. But given that the neighbor was using it without permission, the author might have a point in stopping them. \n\nBut the key is whether the parking spot is the author's. If they have a legal right to park there, then they can exclude others. If not, maybe they can't. Since the author is a renter, they should check the lease. If the council allowed the neighbor to take half the garden, but the author didn't consent, that's a council issue. The author's brother parking there might be a problem if the spot isn't reserved. \n\nI think the author might be in the right because they were the ones being encroached upon. But if the parking spot isn't legally theirs, then maybe not. But the story says it's their spot, implying ownership. The neighbor's actions are aggressive. The author's response was to reclaim their spot, which is reasonable. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But need to be careful about the legalities here. Since the council owns the house, maybe the author's use of the spot is under their lease. If the council allowed the neighbor to build, the author should go through proper channels. But the author's action was to park their car, which is their right if it's their spot. So the answer is B.\n"
