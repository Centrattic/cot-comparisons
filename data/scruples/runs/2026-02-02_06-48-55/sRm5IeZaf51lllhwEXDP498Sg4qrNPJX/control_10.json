I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting their neighbor park in their parking spot for years because they didn't have a car. The neighbor has four cars, so maybe they needed the space. Now, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming permission from the council. The author stopped them by having their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are property rights and permissions. The author rents the house, so they don't own it. The council owns the house. The neighbor claims the council gave permission to take part of the garden. The author didn't consent. In the UK, council property usually means the council has control, but if the neighbor got permission, maybe they have a right. However, the author might be protected if the neighbor didn't properly secure permission. \n\nAlso, the parking spot: the author allowed parking before, but now they're refusing. If the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it, but if the neighbor was using it without permission all along, that's a problem. The author's action of parking their brother's car could be seen as reclaiming their space. \n\nBut the neighbor's claim about the council's permission is a big issue. If the council did approve the driveway, the author might be in trouble for blocking construction. However, if the neighbor didn't get proper consent from the council or if the author's property is part of the council's ownership, the author should contact the council first. \n\nThe author's approach might be confrontational. Using their brother to park there could escalate things. The right move might have been to involve the council directly instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the neighbor has valid council permission. If not, maybe the author is justified. But since the neighbor is trying to take half the garden, which the author doesn't consent to, and the author is a renter, the council's rules would matter a lot. \n\nAlso, the neighbor using the parking spot without permission for years could be a problem. If the author never had a lease agreement allowing that, the neighbor was trespassing. The author stopping them now could be their right. \n\nBut the main conflict is about the driveway. If the neighbor has proper permission, the author's interference is wrong. If not, the author is protecting their space. Without knowing the council's stance, it's hard to say, but the author acting on their own might not be the best approach. They should probably go through official channels. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for reclaiming their parking spot, especially if the neighbor was using it without permission. However, the driveway issue requires checking with the council. The author's method might be hasty, but their intent is to protect their property. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
