I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So the author lives in the UK, rents their house, and has a parking spot. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago and used the spot when the author didn't have a car. Then the neighbor (the wife) asked to take half the garden for a porch, which was denied. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property without consent, claiming council permission. The author then had their brother park there to assert ownership, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. Since the author rents, they don't own the property, but they do have the right to use it as per their lease. The neighbor trying to take half the garden without consent is likely a problem. If the council owns the house, maybe there's some shared ownership or rules about the garden. But the author's spot is free, so the neighbors parking there might be on a temporary basis. The author allowed them to park for years, but now they want to stop. Is that reasonable? The neighbor's entitlement is a red flag, but the author has the right to their space, especially if it's part of their rental. The author's action of parking their brother's car to enforce the rule might be a bit aggressive, but it's a way to reclaim their space. However, since they don't own the property, they can't make permanent changes. The main issue is the neighbor's unauthorized construction. The author is stopping them from parking, which they can do if they have rights to the spot. So maybe the author is right to enforce their space, especially after the neighbor's overreach. But maybe the author overreacted with the brother parking there? But overall, the neighbor seems to be in the wrong for trying to take the garden. The author's actions are a defense of their property rights. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
