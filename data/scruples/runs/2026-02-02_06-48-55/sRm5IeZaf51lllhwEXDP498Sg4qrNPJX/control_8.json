I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not letting their neighbor park in their spot. They've been renting the house for 18 years, and the neighbor family has four cars. Initially, the author allowed them to park there because they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author got angry, had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author doesn't own the house; it's rented from the council. The neighbor's family used the spot for years. The author allowed it out of kindness. Then the neighbor tried to take garden space, which was denied. The author then stopped allowing parking after a confrontation.\n\nLegal ownership matters here. If the author rents the property, they don't own the land or the garden. The council owns the house, so any changes to the property would require their permission. The neighbor got permission from the council to build a driveway, but the author hasn't consented. However, if the council gave permission, maybe the neighbor has a right to it, but the author is the tenant. The author might not have the legal right to prevent the construction if the council approved it. \n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The neighbor might have a legal right to the driveway if the council approved it, even if the author doesn't like it. The author's refusal to let them park now could be a reaction to the neighbor's entitlement, but since they don't own the property, they don't have the authority to deny parking if the spot is technically on the council's land. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they don't own the property, so their control over it is limited. The council's approval might override the author's consent. Also, using a brother to park there is a confrontational move, which might be seen as aggressive. The neighbor's initial use of the parking spot was allowed by the author, but now stopping them without legal grounds could be problematic. \n\nAnswer: A (the author is in the wrong) because they don't own the property and the council's approval might legally allow the neighbor's changes. The author's actions are based on personal feelings rather than legal ownership.\n"
