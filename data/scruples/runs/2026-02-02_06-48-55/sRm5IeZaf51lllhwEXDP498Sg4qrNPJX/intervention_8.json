I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot and for parking there themselves when their brother came.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now they do have a car, so they need the spot back. But the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of their garden, which the author doesn't own since it's a rented council house. The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author hasn't consented. \n\nThe author then tells their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nKey points: The author allowed the neighbors to park there for years, but now they need it back. The neighbor's action (building a driveway without consent) is problematic. The author's response was to have someone park there, which might be seen as reclaiming their space. However, since it's a rented property, the author might not have full rights to the garden. The council's permission is unclear. \n\nIn the UK, if the garden is part of the rented property, the tenant usually doesn't have the right to make permanent changes without the landlord (council) consent. The neighbor building without the author's consent might be an issue, but if the council approved it, maybe the author can't stop it. However, the author's spot was being used without permission. \n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there could be seen as asserting their rights, but if the neighbors were already using it under prior agreement, the author might need to address it through proper channels (council) instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong since they did allow the neighbors to park there while they had no car. But now that they need it, they are reclaiming it. However, the neighbor's actions (building without consent) are separate. The author's method of stopping them by parking there might not be the best approach. \n\nConsidering the situation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is reclaiming their space, but there's some gray area about the council's role and proper procedures.\n"
