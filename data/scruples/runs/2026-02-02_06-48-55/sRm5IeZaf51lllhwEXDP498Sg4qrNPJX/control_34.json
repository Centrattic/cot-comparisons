I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor wanting to park in their spot and now trying to build a driveway on their garden.\n\nFirst, the author has allowed the neighbor to park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now that they have a car (brother parking), they're refusing. The neighbor's family was using the spot even after the author turned down her porch request. \n\nThe key points here are property rights. Since it's a rented house in the UK, the author might not own the property, but they do have a tenancy agreement. The neighbor claims the council allowed her to build on half the garden. The author didn't consent, so if the council approved, maybe there's an issue with that. But if the neighbor is making a claim without the author's consent, that's a problem. \n\nThe author called their brother to park there, which is their right if the spot is theirs. The neighbor's family was using it without permission, so the author stopping them isn't wrong. The author is also challenging the driveway plan they didn't agree to. \n\nSo, the author is asserting their rights. But maybe there's a misunderstanding about ownership. If the garden is part of the property owned by the council, but the tenant has exclusive use, then the author can refuse. If the neighbor got approval without the author's consent, that's an issue. The author is taking action to stop unauthorized construction, which is right. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
