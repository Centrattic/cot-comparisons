I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbor park in their spot. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe author has a parking spot they've allowed the neighbors to use for years because they (the author) didn't have a car. Now, the author got a car and their brother parked there. The neighbor tried to build a driveway on half of the author's garden without consent. The author stopped them by parking there.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house? Wait, no, they rent from the council. So the council owns the house, and the author is a tenant. The neighbor approached the author's wife, asking to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without permission. The author confronted them.\n\nNow, parking spot: since the author is a tenant, the parking spot's ownership matters. If the parking spot is part of the property they're renting, technically, it belongs to the council. But since the author has been using it or allowing others to use it, there might be an informal agreement. But the author could argue that they were allowing the neighbors to park there as a favor, not a right.\n\nThe neighbor didn't get permission from the council for the driveway. The author is trying to stop that. The author's action of having their brother park there to prevent the neighbor from parking might be seen as asserting their rights over the space they rent. However, if the parking spot isn't legally theirs to control, maybe they are overstepping.\n\nIn the UK, parking spaces can be tricky. If the front garden is part of the property, the tenant might have rights to it, but the council's ownership complicates things. The neighbor's claim that the council gave permission might not hold if the author hasn't agreed. But the author needs to check with the council.\n\nSo the author's actions could be justified if they have a right to the parking spot. But if they don't own it and the council allows the neighbor to use it, then maybe not. However, the neighbor was trying to take over the author's garden without consent, which is definitely an issue.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to the parking spot and garden, the neighbor's unauthorized building, and the author's response. If the parking spot is part of the rented property, the author has a right to use it. The neighbor's entitlement to use it might be based on an informal agreement that the author can now revoke.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were using their space (front garden and parking spot) as they see fit, and the neighbor overstepped by trying to take it without permission. The author's action to park there is a way to assert their rights. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
