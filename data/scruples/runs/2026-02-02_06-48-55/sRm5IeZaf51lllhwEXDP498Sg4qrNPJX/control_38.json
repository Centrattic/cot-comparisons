I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their parking spot. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. But now, the author has a brother who parks there. The neighbors, especially the wife, wanted to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then, the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's property without their consent. The author called their brother to park there to prevent the neighbors from using it anymore.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about property rights and unauthorized construction. The author rents the house from the council, so ownership is with the council. But the front garden is part of the property. If the neighbors are trying to build on the author's property, that's a problem. The author might have the right to prevent that if the council hasn't given permission. However, the council's role is important here. If the council has given the neighbor permission, then maybe the author can't stop them. But the author claims the neighbor hasn't obtained consent.\n\nThe parking spot: if the parking spot is part of the rented property, then the author has the right to control who parks there. The neighbors were using it without permission, which the author is now stopping. The author's action of parking their brother's car there might be enforcing their own right. But if the parking spot is shared or part of a common area, maybe not. However, in the UK, front gardens are typically part of the property, and if the parking spot is private, the author has the right to control it.\n\nThe neighbor's attempt to build a driveway without consent is a legal issue. The author is correct in contacting the council. The author's action of parking their brother's car might be a way to block the neighbors from parking there, which could be a form of self-help, but it's not necessarily illegal if the author is asserting their rights. However, there might be a better way to handle it through official channels.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is standing up for their property rights. However, if the neighbor has legitimate permissions from the council, the author might be complicating matters. But the author hasn't confirmed that. Overall, the author's actions seem justified in protecting their property and preventing unauthorized construction. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
