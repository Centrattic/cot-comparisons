I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and a driveway dispute with the neighbor.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they do have a car, they're refusing. The neighbor then tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor says the council allowed her to take half the garden for a driveway, but the author says they don't own the house, it's rented from the council. The author then had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nHmm. The key points are about property rights. Since the author is a tenant, their rights might be limited. If the house is owned by the council, the author probably doesn't have the right to let others park there in the first place unless the council allowed it. But the author did that for years. Now, if the neighbor got permission from the council to build a driveway on the author's garden, then maybe the author's garden is actually the neighbor's property or the council decided to use it. But the author is objecting because they want to keep their garden. \n\nBut the author is a tenant, so they can't make decisions about the property's structure. The neighbor might have the right to build a driveway if the council approved it. The author's action of preventing parking by having their brother park there could be seen as interfering with the neighbor's permitted use. Also, if the parking spot is part of the council's property, the author doesn't own it, so letting the neighbors park there was unauthorized. So the author might be in the wrong for claiming control over a spot they don't own. Also, building a driveway on someone else's property (even if it's council-owned) without the owner's (council's) permission would be an issue, but the neighbor might have permission. The author is trying to stop them, but if the council allowed it, the author as a tenant can't override that. \n\nSo the author's actions in blocking the neighbors from parking and confronting them might be wrong because they don't have the legal right to the property. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they don't own the property and can't control who parks there, and interfering with council-approved plans is problematic.\n"
