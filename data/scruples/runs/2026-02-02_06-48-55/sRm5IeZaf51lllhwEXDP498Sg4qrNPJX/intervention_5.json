I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a neighbor using the author's parking spot and then trying to build a driveway on the author's garden.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, they let the neighbors park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now, after the author gets a car, they're refusing to let the neighbors park there anymore. The neighbor (the wife) asked to take up half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the husband tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission, which the author disputes. The author then had their brother park there to block the neighbors, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership and permissions. The author is a tenant, so the property technically belongs to the council. If the neighbors are using the parking spot without the council's permission, maybe the author isn't the one to grant that. But the author had allowed it for years, assuming they had some control. However, when the neighbor tried to take over more space, the author pushed back.\n\nThe author's main issue is the neighbor's entitlement and the unauthorized construction. The author is protecting their property, but since they don't own it, maybe the council should handle it. The author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbors could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the best approach, but if the neighbors were indeed using the space without permission, the author has a right to object.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong). The author is defending their property and the neighbor's unauthorized actions. However, the author's method of response (having someone park there) might be aggressive, but given the neighbor's overreach, it's understandable. The real wrongdoer could be the neighbor for claiming the spot without proper authorization. The author is just standing up for their rights as a tenant, even if they don't own the house. The council's involvement is crucial here, and the author is right to contact them. So, the answer is B.\n"
