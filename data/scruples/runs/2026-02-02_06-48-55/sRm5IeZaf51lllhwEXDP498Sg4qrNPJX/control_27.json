I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. The situation involves a neighbor family with four cars, living in the UK where parking is on the street. The author has been letting them park for years when they didn't have a car. Then the neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which was refused. Now, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property without consent.\n\nThe key points here are property rights and permissions. In the UK, if you rent a property, the landlord (council in this case) owns the property. So the author doesn't own the front garden; the council does. The neighbor claiming permission from the council to build a driveway on the author's garden might have a basis if the council approved it. However, the author is objecting, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe author's decision to use their brother to park in the spot to prevent the neighbors from parking might be seen as reclaiming their spot, especially since they previously allowed it when they had no car. But since the author now has a car (or their brother does), needing the space is reasonable. However, the neighbor's attempt to take over the garden without the author's consent is where the main issue lies.\n\nThe council's role is important. If the council approved the driveway, the author's refusal might be against that decision. However, the author's right to object as a tenant could depend on the tenancy agreement. If the council gave permission without consulting the tenant, that might be a problem. But the author's actions in blocking parking might be justified if the council's approval is invalid or if the author's rights as a tenant weren't considered.\n\nThe user's actions seem to be a stand-up for their property rights, especially since the neighbor is trying to take over their space without consent. The author's use of their brother's car to assert control might be seen as a reasonable response to prevent the neighbor from parking there, given the previous refusal to let the neighbor take over the garden. However, there's a potential for escalation here. But considering the neighbor's entitlement and the council's possible role, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're protecting their space against unauthorized changes and misuse. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
