I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor parking in their spot and then a dispute over a driveway. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, the author is in the UK, where they rent a house from the council. They've lived there for 18 years. The neighbor has four cars and has been using the author's parking spot for years while the author didn't have a car. Now, the author does have a car, and the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden. The author refused the initial request to take half the garden for a porch, then the neighbor changed the plan to a driveway, claiming council permission. The author then told their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the main issues are: 1) The neighbor's entitlement to park in the author's spot, and 2) The author's response to the driveway construction.\n\nFor the parking spot: Since the author is a renter, the parking spot likely belongs to the council. The neighbor might have a right to park there if it's part of their own property or if the council allows it. However, the author allowed them to park there out of kindness. Now that the author has a car, the neighbor should be informed that the spot is no longer available. But the author didn't clarify boundaries earlier. However, in the UK, street parking is usually public, so if the spot isn't officially theirs, they can't legally prevent someone from parking. The author might have assumed it was their spot informally, but legally, it's the council's. So the author's refusal could be based on a misunderstanding of ownership.\n\nFor the driveway: The neighbor says the council gave permission. If the council (as the landlord) approved the driveway, the author can't unilaterally stop it. Even if the author doesn't consent, the council's permission might be binding. The author's brother parking there could be seen as provocative or using a personal connection to enforce something they don't have control over. The neighbor might have a valid right to build the driveway if the council permitted it, regardless of the author's consent.\n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because the parking spot isn't officially theirs (as a renter), and the neighbor has council permission for the driveway. The author's actions could be seen as obstructive and based on incorrect assumptions about property rights.\n"
