I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot and for taking action by having their brother park there.\n\nFirst, the author has rented the house and the parking spot. The neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago and started using the spot when the author didn't have a car. Now that the author has access to a car (their brother's), they're telling the neighbor to stop using the spot. The neighbor family has four cars, so maybe parking is an issue for them. The neighbor wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author is a tenant, so they don't own the property, but the council owns it. The author called the council to stop the construction and had their brother park there to assert their claim.\n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, you usually have the right to use the land as per the lease. If the parking spot is included in the lease, the author can decide who parks there. The neighbor using it without permission might be a breach of the lease terms. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to the space. The neighbor's actions of trying to take over the garden and building without permission might be illegal. The author's response\u2014parking their own car there and informing the neighbor\u2014seems reasonable. However, the neighbor's claim that the council gave them permission is unclear. The author should contact the council to resolve the dispute, but their actions in this case don't seem wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
