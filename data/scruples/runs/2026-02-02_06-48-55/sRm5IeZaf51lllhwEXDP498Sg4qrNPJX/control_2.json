I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author allowed the neighbors to park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now, the author has a brother's car parked there, and the neighbors are upset. \n\nThe neighbor (the wife) asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author blocked them by having a car park there. \n\nKey points: The author doesn't own the house, it's a rented property from the council. The neighbors are claiming permission to take part of the author's garden. The author is taking a stand by parking their brother's car to prevent access.\n\nLegally, if the garden is part of the rented property, the author might have rights to it, even if they don't own it. The neighbors can't just take someone else's property, especially without the landlord's (council) approval. The author's action of parking there could be a way to assert their rights. \n\nHowever, the author allowed parking for years, which might imply some sort of informal agreement. But the neighbors didn't get consent for the driveway, which is a separate issue. The author is standing up for their property, which the council would need to address. \n\nThe author's actions in parking the brother's car might be seen as reasonable to prevent unauthorized construction. Since the council owns the house, the author should involve them to resolve the dispute. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their rights against the neighbor's encroachment. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
