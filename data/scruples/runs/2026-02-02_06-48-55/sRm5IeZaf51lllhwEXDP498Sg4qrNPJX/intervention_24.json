I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and a dispute over property. The author lives in the UK, rents a house from the council, and has been letting their neighbors park in their parking spot for years because the author didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor (husband, wife, kids) has multiple cars and the wife is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's garden. The council supposedly gave permission, but the author refuses. The author then gets angry and tells their brother to park in the spot, leading to confrontation.\n\nFirst, the author's ownership. Since they rent the house from the council, the parking spot is probably part of the property they rent. So, the author has the right to use that parking space. The neighbors were using it without permission for years. But the author didn't own the house, so maybe the neighbors assumed it was public? But the author says it's their spot. So, the author's not wrong to tell them they can't park there anymore.\n\nThen the neighbor's request to take half the garden. The council gave permission? If the council owns the house, they might have the authority to allow modifications. But the author is a tenant, so maybe the council would have to grant permission. The author didn't consent, so even if the council said yes, maybe the author has a say since it's their rented property. But in the UK, landlords (councils) usually have control over property modifications. So the neighbor might need council approval, not the author's. But the author is upset because their garden is being taken.\n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there to block the neighbors could be problematic. If the parking spot is legally the author's, they can use it. If the neighbors were parking there without permission, that's an issue. But the author allowed them for years, so maybe there's an implied agreement or understanding. However, the author can change their mind since it's their space. But in the UK, you can't just park someone else's car there to block people. That might be an aggressive move and could be seen as harassment.\n\nThe author's response seems to be self-defensive but possibly overreacting. They were angry about the neighbor's entitlement and the driveway issue. The neighbor might be violating council rules by building without proper consent, but the author's method of stopping them by parking a car might not be the right approach. The author should probably go through proper channels like the council to resolve it.\n\nSo, considering all that: the author is not necessarily in the wrong about their own property, but the way they handled it (having someone park to block) could be seen as inconsiderate or confrontational. The neighbors might have been parking there without realizing it's the author's spot, or maybe they thought it was public. The author has the right to stop them, but the method might be questionable. However, the main issue is the neighbor's unauthorized construction. The author is in the right to protect their property but maybe the approach was wrong. So, maybe answer B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are defending their property, but some might argue the method is wrong. But the question is about being in the wrong overall. Since the author is protecting their rented property and the neighbor was using it without permission, the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
