I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their parking spot. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbors to park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now they have a brother park there, leading to a confrontation. The key points here are property ownership and permissions. The author rents the house, so the council owns it. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to take part of the front garden for a driveway. The author didn't consent to that. \n\nSo, the parking spot: if it's part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it. But if the parking spot is part of the public street or shared area, maybe not. In the UK, parking arrangements can depend on local council rules. If the author was allowing the neighbors to park there informally for years, but now the neighbor is trying to claim a legal right, that's a problem. The author's action of parking their brother's car could be seen as asserting their right, but if the spot isn't legally theirs, that might not be valid. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's demand to build a driveway on the author's garden. Since the author doesn't own the house, they might need the council's permission. If the council approved the neighbor's request, the author might not have a say unless they object through proper channels. The author's response seems to be taking matters into their own hands by parking the brother's car, which could be problematic if the council's approval is valid. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author has legal rights to the parking spot and the garden. If the parking spot is part of the rental property, the author might be justified in stopping the neighbors. If not, then maybe the author is in the wrong for blocking the spot. The neighbor's actions (building without consent) are also questionable, but the author's response could be seen as self-help without proper legal steps. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the parking spot is part of the author's tenancy. If yes, then the author is not in the wrong. If the spot is public or shared, then maybe the author overstepped by parking their brother's car. Also, the neighbor's claim about council permission needs to be verified. The author should contact the council for clarification. The author's actions might be justified if they have the right to the spot, but without knowing the exact legal standing, it's hard to say. The key is that the author should resolve this through proper channels rather than confrontation.\n"
