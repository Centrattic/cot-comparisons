I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lives in a rented house in the UK and has a parking spot. The neighbors, who have four cars, have been using the author's parking spot for years because the author didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the author's front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author got angry, had a brother park there, and told the neighbors they can't park anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider UK property laws. Since the author is a tenant, they might not have the right to control the use of the garden if the property is council-owned. But the parking spot is part of the property. If the neighbors were using the spot without permission, maybe that's an issue. However, if the author allowed it for years, maybe they gave implied permission. Now, when the neighbors try to take over the garden, the author is resisting. The council's permission is a key point here. If the council actually approved the neighbor's driveway encroaching on the author's garden, the neighbor might have the right to do it, but the author's refusal could be valid if they didn't give consent. The author's actions in blocking the spot by having someone park there might be seen as asserting their rights, but if the spot isn't legally theirs, they could be in the wrong. Also, the neighbor's entitlement in taking half the garden without consent is problematic, but if the council says it's okay, maybe the author needs to address that legally. The author's reaction seems justified in wanting to stop the unauthorized use, but if the parking spot isn't officially theirs, that complicates things. So, it's a bit of a toss-up, but likely the author isn't in the wrong because they're defending their property against unauthorized use, even if the legal ownership isn't clear.\n"
