I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot and then parking there themselves to block them.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors use their parking spot for years because they didn't have a car. The neighbors have four cars, so maybe they needed the space. Now that the author has a car, they want to use their own spot. But the spot isn't actually theirs; they're a tenant, not the owner. The council owns the house and the garden. The neighbor tried to get permission to build a driveway on the author's garden, which the author didn't consent to. The author then parks there to block the neighbors from using it.\n\nLegally, since it's a rented property, the author doesn't own the space. The council's ownership is key here. The neighbor might have some right if the council gave permission, but the author is contesting that. However, the author's action of parking there themselves could be seen as blocking others from using public or shared space, even if it's their rented spot. The initial permission to park was a long-standing arrangement. The author changed the rules after getting a car, which might be seen as unfair. Also, the neighbor's attempt to build a driveway might be a separate issue the council needs to handle. The author's reaction of parking there to block the neighbors could be confrontational and might not resolve the issue legally. So, considering the legal ownership and the change in usage without prior agreement, the author might be in the wrong for abruptly changing the arrangement and using a confrontational tactic.\n"
