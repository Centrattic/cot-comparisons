I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they had no car. Now, they do have a car, so they want their spot back. The neighbors, especially the wife, tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's property without their consent. The author got angry and told their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author mentions they rent the house, so the council owns it. If the parking spot is part of the property they're renting, then they have the right to control who parks there. Even though they're a tenant, the right to use the garden and parking spot might be part of their tenancy agreement. The council's permission to the neighbor might not override the tenant's rights unless the council explicitly allows it.\n\nThe author allowed the neighbors to park there for years, but that was a goodwill gesture, not a legal right. The neighbors can't claim a right to park there just because they did so for a while. The author is within their rights to revoke that permission when they need the spot for their own use.\n\nRegarding the driveway issue, the neighbor is trying to take half the garden. If the author doesn't own the house, the council's approval would be necessary for any structural changes. But the author hasn't consented, so the neighbor shouldn't proceed without their agreement. The author is right to oppose that.\n\nThe confrontation when the brother parks the car might be seen as a bit confrontational, but the author is asserting their rights. The neighbor's family had been using the spot without permission, so the author is stopping them, which is justified.\n\nIn the UK, property rights are important, and even as a tenant, you can control the use of your rented space. The neighbor's entitlement in trying to take the garden is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their property and usage rights.\n"
