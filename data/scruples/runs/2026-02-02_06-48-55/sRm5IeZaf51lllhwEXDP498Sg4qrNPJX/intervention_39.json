I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has been allowing their neighbor to park in their parking spot because they don't own a car. The neighbor family has four cars, which probably means they need the space more. The author has been letting them park there for years, which is nice of them. But then the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the author's garden to build a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor then tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author got angry and had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the author is a tenant, not the property owner. So they might not have the legal right to give permission for the neighbor to use the garden. The neighbor tried to get council permission, but the author might not be able to block that if the council approved it. However, the author is also a tenant, so they can't just let someone build on their land without the landlord's consent. The author might have legal obligations here. \n\nThe parking spot is part of the rented property, so the author might have the right to use it as they see fit, especially since they don't own a car. But since they've been allowing the neighbor to park there for years, there might be an implied agreement. The neighbor might have relied on that. The author suddenly changing the terms could be seen as unfair, especially if the neighbor had no alternative parking. \n\nWhen the author had their brother park there, causing a confrontation, that might be aggressive. The neighbor's husband was yelling, so tensions were high. The author's actions could be seen as using force or intimidation, which isn't great. However, the neighbor was trying to build on the author's garden without consent, which is a big deal. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not going through proper channels. Instead of using their brother to park, they should have contacted the council or their landlord to resolve the issue. Using a personal confrontation could make things worse. Also, if the council gave permission to the neighbor, the author might have a problem. But if the author's garden is part of the rented property, the council shouldn't allow that without the tenant's consent. \n\nSo, the author might be in the right in stopping the unauthorized building but used an aggressive method. However, the neighbor might have rights if the council approved it. The parking issue is complicated because the author allowed it for years, creating an expectation. The author's actions could be seen as fair if they never gave permission for the driveway, but the method of enforcement (having a brother park) might be questionable. \n\nOverall, the author might be in the right in principle but handled it in a poor way. The neighbor could be at fault for trying to build without consent, but the author's method of stopping them might not be the best approach. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they have a valid point about their property, but the method could be criticized. Or maybe A if the author shouldn't have allowed parking after years of letting them. Hmm, it's tricky.\n"
