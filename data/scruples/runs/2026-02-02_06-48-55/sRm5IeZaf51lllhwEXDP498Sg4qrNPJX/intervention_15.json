I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They provided a detailed account of the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a renter living in a house owned by the council. The neighbor, who moved in a few years ago, has four cars. Initially, the author allowed the neighbor to park in their spot because they didn't own a car. Now the author has a brother's car parking there.\n\nThe neighbor asked to take half the author's garden for a porch, which was denied. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author then had their brother park the car to block the spot, leading to confrontation.\n\nKey points: The author is a renter, so maybe their rights are limited compared to a homeowner. The neighbor's actions of building on the author's property without consent are problematic. The author's response was to block their parking spot, which might be seen as retaliating. \n\nIn the UK, even as a tenant, you have rights to the property you're renting unless the landlord allows otherwise. If the neighbor is building without permission, the author is right to stop that. But using their spot, which might not be legally theirs if it's part of the council property, could complicate things. If the spot isn't officially theirs, the neighbor might have a right to use it, but the author had previously allowed it. Now, the neighbor's demands are overstepping.\n\nThe author's action of parking a car to block the spot could be seen as using a past kindness against the neighbor. The neighbor's entitlement to take the garden area is wrong. However, the method of response (blocking the spot) might not be the best approach. But considering the neighbor's actions, the author might be justified in protecting their own space, especially as a tenant against a neighbor's encroachment.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their rights against the neighbor's overreach, even if the method is a bit confrontational. The neighbor's actions are more problematic. So answer B.\n"
