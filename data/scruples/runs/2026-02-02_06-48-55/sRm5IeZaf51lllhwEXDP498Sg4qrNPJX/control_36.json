I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a tenant in the UK, renting a house from the council. Their neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago and started using the author's parking spot when the author didn't have a car. The author allowed this for years. Then, the neighbor's wife asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which was denied. After that, the neighbor family stopped greeting the author and continued using the parking spot. Now, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half the author's property, claiming council permission. The author then parks their brother's car there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are about property rights and permissions. Since the author is a tenant, they don't own the house, but they do have the right to use the front garden as part of their rented property. The neighbor's claim that the council gave permission to build on half of the author's garden is a red flag. If the council actually approved this, they should have informed the tenant. But the author didn't consent, which is their right. \n\nHowever, the author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbor might be seen as a bit of a confrontation. The neighbor's family had been using the spot for years, but the author is now asserting their right to stop them. The neighbor's attempt to take over the garden without the author's consent is definitely an issue. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let them park and for parking their brother's car. Since the author is the tenant, they have the right to use their allocated space. The neighbor's actions, especially trying to take over the garden without consent, are problematic. The author's response, while maybe a bit aggressive, is a reaction to the neighbor's overstepping. \n\nBut legally, if the parking spot is part of the author's rented property, they can decide who parks there. The neighbor using it without permission was wrong. The author's refusal is justified. However, the method of enforcing it by parking their brother's car might have escalated things unnecessarily. But in terms of being in the wrong, the neighbor's actions are more to blame here. The author is defending their rights as a tenant. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
