I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot, especially after some conflict about a driveway.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author has been letting the neighbor's family park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's front garden. The key here is that the author rents the house, so they don't own it. The council owns the house, which might mean they have to follow specific rules or permissions from the council.\n\nThe neighbor claims the council gave permission for the driveway, but the author hasn't consented. The author then calls their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation. \n\nLegally, if the author doesn't own the property, they might not have the authority to restrict parking there. Even if they rented the house, the landlord (council) would typically control such matters. The author's actions could be seen as creating a nuisance or interfering with the neighbor's legal rights if the council approved the driveway. \n\nHowever, the neighbor's request to build on the author's garden without consent is a problem. The author has a right to object, but maybe the proper way is through the council. The author's brother parking there could be a violation if the parking spot is public or if the council's rules allow it. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for taking matters into their own hands by having someone park there, especially if they don't have the legal right to do so. The proper course would be to involve the council or authorities, not to block the neighbor's access through personal actions. The neighbor, on the other hand, shouldn't be building without the author's consent, but if the council approved it, maybe they have a case. \n\nIn the UK, property rights and council rules are important. The author's actions could lead to legal issues if they're not the property owner. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for taking unauthorized action, even if they have a valid grievance about the driveway.\n"
