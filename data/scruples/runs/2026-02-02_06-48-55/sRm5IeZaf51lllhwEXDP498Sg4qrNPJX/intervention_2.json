I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves neighbors parking in the author's spot and then a dispute over part of the garden.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they let the neighbors park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car themselves. Now that they have a car, they're telling the neighbors they can't park there anymore. The neighbors, particularly the wife, had previously asked for part of the garden for a porch and were denied. Then, the wife and family started using the parking spot again, which the author is now blocking by having their brother park there. \n\nThe key points here are property ownership. The author is a tenant, not the owner, so they might not have full control over the property. The council owns the house, which means they might need permission for any changes. The neighbor's claim that the council gave her permission to take half the garden is something the author should verify. The author's actions in having their brother park there could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of legal rights, if the parking spot is part of the rented property, the tenant might have the right to use it, but there's no ownership. The neighbor building a driveway on half the garden without the tenant's consent could be problematic, but since the house is council-owned, the council's permission might be required. The author's brother parking there might block the neighbor's access temporarily, but if the council has given permission to the neighbor, the author might not have the legal right to prevent that. \n\nHowever, the author's actions could be seen as a response to the neighbor's encroachment. The neighbor's entitlement in taking up the garden without consent is also an issue. The author might not be in the wrong if they have a right to use the garden as part of their tenancy agreement. But if the council has allowed the neighbor to use the space, the author might need to involve the council to resolve the dispute rather than taking direct action.\n\nThe author's brother parking there as a confrontation might not be the best method, but the core issue is about property rights and permissions. The neighbor's actions are also questionable if they're building without proper authorization. The author is within their rights to stop others from parking in their spot if they have the right to use it, but the garden issue might require council intervention. \n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong in refusing parking, but their method of blocking it by having someone else park there could be problematic. The neighbor's actions in building without consent are also an issue. But since the author is a tenant, the council's rules might dictate who has rights over the garden and parking. So the answer could lean toward the author not being in the wrong (B) regarding the parking but the garden issue being more complex, but the main question is about the parking spot. The neighbor's use of the garden is another layer. Since the author's brother parking there was a reaction to the neighbor's actions, it's about enforcing their own right to the spot. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
