I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and a neighbor wanting to use part of their garden.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car initially, so they let the neighbors park in their spot for years. That part seems okay\u2014being generous when they had no need themselves.\n\nThen, the neighbor asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. The neighbor stopped greeting them, but the author didn't care. Then the neighbor tried again to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author didn't consent and called their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, in the UK, if the house is council-owned, the council probably owns the land. So the author doesn't actually own the property, just the house. If the neighbor got permission from the council to use part of the front garden, maybe the author can't unilaterally stop that. But if the council didn't actually approve it, then the neighbor can't just take it. The author's action of parking their brother's car there might be taking things into their own hands. \n\nThe author is essentially using a tactic of \"my car, my spot\" to block the neighbor. But if the neighbor has valid permission from the council, then the author might be overstepping. However, if the council's permission is invalid or not properly granted, the author is protecting their own space. The problem is the author isn't sure about the council's approval and took matters into their own hands. \n\nAlso, the neighbor was using the parking spot for years, but the author is now restricting access. Maybe the author is in the right because they were being taken advantage of. But the way they handled it\u2014calling their brother to park there\u2014could be seen as aggressive. \n\nIn terms of legal ownership, if the council owns the land, the author doesn't have the right to control access permanently. But if the neighbor is using the spot without permission, the author might be within their rights to stop it. However, using a relative to park there might be seen as a hostile act rather than a legal one. \n\nSo there's a mix here. The author might be justified in stopping unauthorized use but handled it in a way that's confrontational. The neighbor's request for a driveway might be legally possible if the council approves, but the author's refusal to let them park now could be a reaction to past behavior. \n\nI think the author is partially in the right to protect their property but maybe in the wrong for how they handled it. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they used a personal tactic instead of going through proper channels. But I'm a bit confused about the council's role here. If the neighbor has permission, the author can't block it. If not, maybe the author is justified. Since the author is unsure and took action without confirming, that's where they might be in the wrong.\n"
