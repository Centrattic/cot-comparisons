I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about parking and a neighbor trying to take over part of their property.\n\nFirst, the author let the neighbors park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now that the author has a car, they're telling the neighbors to stop. The neighbor then asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming council permission. The author had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIn the UK, property ownership matters. The author rents, so maybe the council is the legal owner of the house and garden. If the neighbor got council permission, maybe she's within her rights. But the author's garden is part of their rented property. If the neighbor is taking half without the author's consent, that's a problem. Even if the council approved, the author might have a right to object since they're the tenant.\n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbors might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, if the parking spot is part of the author's rented property, they have the right to use it. The neighbor's claim of council permission needs to be checked. The author is probably in the right to protect their allocated space, but maybe they should have handled it through official channels instead of using a family member. However, the neighbor's actions to take over the garden without consent are questionable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
