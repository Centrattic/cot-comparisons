I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is at fault for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot and for parking their brother's car there to block the neighbors.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has been renting a house from the council for 18 years. The neighbor moved in 3-4 years ago and used the author's parking spot because the author didn't have a car. Now, the author has a car and wants the spot back. The neighbor, who doesn't own the house, is trying to build a driveway on the author's garden with the council's permission, which the author objects to. The author then parks their brother's car in the spot to block the neighbors, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve using a family member's car to occupy the spot, which might be seen as aggressive. However, the author had been allowing the neighbors to park there for years, now changing the policy. But since the author is a tenant, ownership isn't clear. The neighbor's plan to take over part of the garden is a different issue, possibly a legal matter with the council. The author's main action here is about the parking spot. \n\nIn the UK, if the author is a tenant, the council owns the property. The parking spot might be considered part of the property or public. If the neighbor has been using it as a free spot, maybe there's an informal agreement. The author changing that could be seen as reasonable since they now need it. But using a relative's car to block the spot might be confrontational. However, the neighbor was already using it without permission, so the author is reclaiming it. The author's right to the garden is another issue, but the parking is the immediate question.\n\nThe neighbor's family using the spot without the author's consent after being asked to stop might mean the author is within their rights to stop them. But since the author initially allowed it, there's a question of implied permission. However, the author can change their mind. The brother parking the car might be a bit of a strong move, but it's a way to enforce the new policy. \n\nLegally, if the spot is on the author's property (even if they're a tenant), they can control access. If it's a public space, that's different. But given the context, the author likely has the right to use the spot as they see fit now. The neighbor's entitlement in building a driveway is a separate legal issue, but the parking refusal is about the author's own space. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for stopping the neighbors from parking there, especially after the neighbor's aggressive request to take the garden. The parking action was a way to enforce their stance. The neighbor's behavior (stopping greetings, unauthorized construction) adds context. The author's actions seem justified as self-defense against the neighbor's overreach.\n"
