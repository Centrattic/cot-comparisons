I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their parking spot. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author has been living in their rented house for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car initially, so they allowed the neighbors to use their parking spot. Now, the author's brother parks there, and the neighbors are upset. The neighbors also tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property without consent. The author then parks their brother's car there to block them.\n\nFirst, the author is a tenant, not the homeowner. In the UK, if the property is owned by the council, the tenant's rights might be limited. But parking spots can be tricky. If the parking spot is part of the leased property, the tenant might have the right to control it. However, if the neighbors have been using it for years, there might be some implied permission or even adverse possession claims, but that's complicated.\n\nThe author allowed the neighbors to park there for years when they had no car. Now that they have a car, they're revoking that permission. Legally, if the parking spot is part of the property they rent, they can decide who parks there. But if the neighbors have been using it as a de facto parking spot through long-term use, maybe there's an argument that they have some right. But in the UK, the council owns the house, so they might have specific rules about parking. The neighbor claiming the council gave permission to take the garden is another point. The author might need to contact the council to clarify.\n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the neighbors could be seen as preventing their use, which might be within their rights if they own the spot. However, if the neighbors had been using it for so long, maybe the author should have communicated earlier. Also, the neighbor started building without consent, which the author is trying to stop. The author's response was to block the parking spot, which seems like a way to enforce their claim.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the parking spot is theirs, then no. However, if the neighbors have a right to park there through long-term use or if the council has a different arrangement, maybe. Since the author is a tenant, maybe the council has a say. The author's brother parking there might be a temporary solution but could be seen as aggressive. The main issue is whether the author has the legal right to control the parking spot and the garden area. Without knowing the exact terms of the council's lease, it's hard to say, but generally, tenants can control areas they're allocated. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure about UK tenant rights regarding parking and garden areas.\n"
