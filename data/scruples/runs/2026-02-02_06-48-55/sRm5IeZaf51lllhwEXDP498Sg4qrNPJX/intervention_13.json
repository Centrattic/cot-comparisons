I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author has been living in the house for 18 years, which is a long time. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author let them park in their spot because they didn't have a car. That seems generous. Now the author has a brother with a car, so they're using the spot. But the key point is ownership. The author mentions they rent the house from the council, so they don't own the property. \n\nThe neighbors wanted to build a driveway on half of the author's garden, and the council allegedly gave permission. The author refused and then blocked the parking spot by having their brother park there. The neighbor tried to build a driveway without the author's consent, which is a problem because the author is the one who has the right to the garden, even if they don't own the house. \n\nIn the UK, if you're a tenant, you might have certain rights to the garden unless the council has given permission for changes. The neighbor claiming council permission might not be valid if the author is still on the lease. Also, the author had allowed parking for years, but now is stopping because they need the spot. \n\nThe author's actions in having someone park there to block the neighbors could be seen as a form of protest, but it might be considered a bit aggressive. However, the neighbors were planning to take over the garden without consent, which is a more serious issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were using their own spot, which they were allowing others to use before. But since they don't own the property, maybe they should check if the council has any restrictions. However, the main conflict is about the driveway. The author is trying to protect their right to the garden from unauthorized use. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their rights regarding their rented property. The neighbor's entitlement to build without consent is the bigger issue. The parking spot was a temporary arrangement that's now changed due to the author having a car. The author's action to block parking to prevent the driveway construction is a reaction to a more serious encroachment.\n"
