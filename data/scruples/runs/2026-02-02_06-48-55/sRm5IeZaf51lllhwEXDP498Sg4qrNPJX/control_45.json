I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their spot. They've been letting the neighbors park there for years because they didn't have a car. Now that they have a car, they want to use their spot. The neighbor wife tried to build a porch on their garden, which was denied. Then the neighbor claims the council allowed her to take half the garden for a driveway. The author told their brother to park there to block the neighbors, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about the parking spot. If the author owns or rents the house, does the parking spot belong to them? In the UK, if it's a private driveway or allocated parking spot, then yes. If the garden is part of the property they rent, the council might have some say, but the neighbor can't just take it without permission. The author had prior use of the spot without the neighbor's cars, so they likely have the right to use it now. \n\nThen there's the neighbor's entitlement. The neighbor tried to take over the garden, which the author rightfully refused. The author's action of parking their own car there seems reasonable to prevent the neighbor from using it. The neighbor's claim about the council is odd; usually, any construction would require permission from the council or landlord, but the author should check that. \n\nThe author's brother parking there might be a bit of a provocation, but if the spot is legally theirs, then they have the right. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to their own property. The neighbor's actions are the problem here. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
