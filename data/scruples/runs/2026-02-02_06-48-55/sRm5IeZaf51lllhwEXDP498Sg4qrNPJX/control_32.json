I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbors to park in their spot for years, especially since they didn't have a car themselves. The neighbor family has four cars, so parking must be tight. Then, the neighbor asked to take half of the author's front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. After that, the neighbor stopped greeting them, but their family kept using the parking spot.\n\nNow, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's property. The author mentions they don't own the house; it's owned by the council. The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author refuses. The author then brings their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are property rights. Since the author rents the house, they don't own the land. The council owns the house, which might mean the garden is part of the council's property. If the neighbor is trying to take half of the garden, they might need council permission. The author's refusal to let parking is about their own property, even if they rent it. But if the neighbor has council permission, maybe they have rights there.\n\nBut the author is asserting their right to control their rental property. Even as a tenant, they might have some rights over the garden if it's considered part of their leased space. However, if the neighbor has permission from the council, the author might be hindering a legal development. The confrontation where the author parks their brother's car to block parking might be seen as aggressive. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's family had been using the spot without permission for years, so the author's refusal now could be justified if they never gave consent. But the neighbor's request to take over the garden might require the council's approval, which the author can dispute if they object. \n\nIn the UK, council-owned properties usually have specific rules. If the garden is part of the rented property, the tenant might have rights to control it. But if the neighbor is building a driveway on someone else's land, that's a problem. The author's actions to block parking might be their right, but the confrontation method (sending their brother) could be seen as confrontational. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be wrong for asserting their property rights, but the way they handled it could be questionable. If the neighbor actually has council permission, the author should address that through proper channels instead of using a confrontational approach. But the question is about the right to refuse parking. Since the author never gave permission, they can revoke it. However, the author's actions in blocking parking with their brother's car might be seen as aggressive. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author had the right to refuse parking. Since it's their rented spot, they can decide who parks there. But if the neighbor was using it under some prior agreement, maybe there's an implied right. But the author had been allowing it, but that doesn't mean it was a permanent arrangement. The author can change their mind. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), but there are nuances. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing, but their method of handling it could have been better. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong for refusing parking. Since the author owns (rents) the spot, they can refuse. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
