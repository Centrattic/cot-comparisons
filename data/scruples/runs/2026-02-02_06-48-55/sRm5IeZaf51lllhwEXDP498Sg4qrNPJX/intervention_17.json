I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot and for confronting them. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author has lived in the house for 18 years, the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't mind their parking when they had no car. Now, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on part of the author's garden, which the author doesn't own (it's a rented council house). The neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author objects. The author then tells their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation when the neighbor's husband yells at the brother.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Property**: The author doesn't own the house; it's council-owned. The garden might be part of the property, but since the author is a tenant, any changes to the garden (like building a driveway) would require the council's permission. The neighbor claiming council permission might be valid if they obtained it, but the author is a tenant, so their rights are limited.\n\n2. **Parking Spot Usage**: The author allowed the neighbors to park there for years. If the parking spot is part of the council property, the author's ability to control it is limited. Allowing others to park there without permission could be a misuse of the shared space.\n\n3. **Conflict Escalation**: The author's response was to have their brother park there, leading to a confrontation. This action could be seen as provocative, especially if the parking spot isn't exclusively theirs. The confrontation might have been avoided by addressing the issue through proper channels (like the council) instead of using a friend to assert control.\n\n4. **Neighbor's Entitlement**: The neighbor's request to take half the garden for a porch was denied. Now they're building a driveway, claiming council permission. The author is correct to object if the council didn't actually give permission, but as a tenant, the author might not have the authority to stop it.\n\n5. **Legal Rights**: Since the author is a tenant, they don't have the same rights as an owner. Any changes to the property, including garden use, should be handled by the council. The author's actions in blocking the parking spot could be against the rules, especially if it's a shared space.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for several reasons. They allowed parking for years, which could imply tacit acceptance. By suddenly changing their stance and using a friend to park, they might be disrupting a de facto arrangement. Additionally, the council's rules and permissions are the proper avenue for resolving such disputes, not personal enforcement. The author's method of confrontation could be seen as aggressive and not addressing the issue through the correct channels.\n"
