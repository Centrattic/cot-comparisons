I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot and also for confronting them when they tried to build a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been renting the house from the council for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car initially, so they allowed the neighbors to use their parking spot for years. Now that the author has a car, they're refusing the neighbors access. The neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor claimed the council allowed her to build a driveway on the author's property. The author got angry, told their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, in the UK, parking spots and garden ownership can be tricky. If the author rents the house, the council is the legal owner. The neighbor's claim that the council permits her to take half the garden is a red flag. The author might not have the legal right to block the neighbor's council-approved construction. However, the neighbor might be overstepping by using the author's property without permission.\n\nThe author's actions: using a family member to park there to prevent the neighbors from parking, leading to an argument. That seems aggressive. The author allowed parking for years but suddenly changed the policy. Maybe the neighbor relied on that spot, and the author's sudden refusal caused tension. The author also confronted the neighbor, which could be seen as hostile.\n\nBut the neighbor's plan to build on the author's property without consent is problematic. If the council approved it, the author should contest that legally. The author's response might be justified in trying to stop the neighbor, but the method\u2014using a family member to park and then confronting\u2014might be seen as escalatory.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, if the author doesn't own the house, they can't legally give permission for the neighbor's construction. The council's approval is key here. The author should involve the council to resolve the driveway issue. As for parking, if the spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it now. However, the neighbor's use over time might create a different situation. Maybe the author should check with the council about the parking spot's ownership to avoid disputes.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as in the right to protect their property, but the way they handled it\u2014suddenly changing the parking policy and using a confrontational approach\u2014could be problematic. The neighbor's entitlement to build on the garden without consent is definitely an issue. The author's response to the driveway is more about self-advocacy, but the parking refusal might depend on legal ownership and usage rights.\n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong for protecting their property, but the method of handling the dispute could be improved. The neighbor's actions (building on someone else's property without consent) are clearly wrong. However, the author's refusal to let them park might depend on whether the spot is part of the rented property and if the neighbor had a right to use it over the years. If the author allowed it for so long, maybe there's an implied agreement. But since they're renting, the council's stance would matter. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they should handle it through proper channels rather than confrontation.\n"
