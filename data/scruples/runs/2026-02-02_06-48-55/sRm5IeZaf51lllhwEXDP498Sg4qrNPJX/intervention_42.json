I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation step by step. The person is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their free spot. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author has been renting the house for 18 years. The neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author let them park in their spot when they had no car. Now the author has a car, so they want to use the spot themselves. The neighbor, the wife, asked to take half the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the wife stopped greeting them. The neighbor family continued using the parking spot. \n\nThen the wife claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway on half the author's garden. The author objects, and then the author tells their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation. The author is now planning to contact the council to stop the driveway.\n\nSo, key points: The author's front garden is part of their rented property. The neighbors are claiming permission from the council to use part of it. The author is a tenant, not the owner. The council owns the house. \n\nIn the UK, council-owned properties can have specific rules. If the council has given permission to the neighbor to build a driveway on the author's garden, there might be an issue with the author's refusal. However, the author's garden is part of their rented property, so they might have a right to object unless the council has agreed to a change. \n\nThe author allowed the neighbors to park for years when they had no car. Now that they do, they're denying parking. But the neighbor family might have relied on that access. However, the main conflict is the driveway. The author's action of parking their brother's car might be a reaction to the neighbor's unauthorized construction. \n\nBut the author is a tenant. If the council approved the driveway, the author might not have the final say. However, if the council didn't actually give permission, the author is within their rights to stop it. Also, the neighbor claiming permission could be false. \n\nThe act of parking the brother's car might be seen as aggressive, but the neighbors were already using the spot without permission. The author's main issue is the driveway, which is more serious than parking. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are in response to the neighbor's unauthorized construction and misuse of the parking spot. The author is a tenant, but their rights might be limited. If the council did give permission, the author might be in the wrong for blocking it. However, if the council didn't, the author is protecting their property. The parking issue is secondary to the driveway dispute. \n\nThe author's use of their brother to park might be a bit confrontational, but it's a reaction to ongoing issues. The main wrong here could be the neighbor claiming council permission without it. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's some nuance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing parking. Since the author is within their rights to use their own spot and the neighbor wasn't granted permission, the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
