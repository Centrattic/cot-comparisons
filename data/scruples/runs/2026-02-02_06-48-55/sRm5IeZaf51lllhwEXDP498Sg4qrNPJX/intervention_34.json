I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and a neighbor trying to build a driveway on their property. The author lives in the UK, rents the house, and has allowed the neighbors to park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbors want to take half of the author's garden for a driveway, which the author refuses. The author then gets their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. Since the author rents the house, they might not have ownership of the front garden. But even as a tenant, if the garden is part of the rented premises, they have rights to it. However, in the UK, driveway construction might involve planning permission and agreements with neighbors. If the council owns the house, maybe there are specific rules about what tenants can do with the property.\n\nThe neighbors asked for permission to build a driveway. The author refused, and the neighbors tried to proceed anyway. The author then blocked their parking spot. But earlier, they allowed the neighbors to park without charge. Now, after the dispute, they're enforcing it. That could be seen as a change in stance without prior notice, which might be a problem. Maybe the author implicitly gave permission by not objecting before, so suddenly revoking it could be unfair.\n\nAlso, the neighbors claimed the council gave them permission. If that's the case, the author might not have the authority to stop them. But if the council didn't actually give permission, then the author is within their rights. The key here is whether the council's permission is valid. The author's response of parking their brother's car might be aggressive, but if the spot is theirs, they can use it. However, using a family member to park there might be a bit of a power play.\n\nAnother angle: the neighbors were using the spot without permission for years. The author allowed it, but now is enforcing it. That could be seen as a breach of good faith. The neighbors might have relied on the spot being available, so the sudden restriction could be unfair. But the author had the right to change their mind since they own the spot.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they rent the house. Do renters have the right to control parking spots? It depends on the lease agreement. If the council allows it, maybe the author can decide how their allocated spot is used. However, if the neighbors were using it under some prior arrangement, the author can't just revoke it without notice, especially if there's a history of permissive use.\n\nThe author's actions of parking their brother's car might be seen as a way to assert control, but it could be considered retaliatory after the neighbors approached to build the driveway. The author's frustration is understandable, but using a family member to park there might not be the best approach. Instead, involving the council or addressing the issue through proper channels would be better.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the right in asserting their property rights, especially since they are the tenant and the neighbors didn't get proper permission. But the sudden change in parking policy without prior notice could be seen as problematic. However, the main issue is the neighbor's unapproved construction. The author's enforcement of their own spot is within their rights, even if it's a bit of a tit-for-tat situation. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
