I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves parking spots and garden usage in the UK.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbor's family to park in their spot for years. They mention living there for 18 years, the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, the author had no car, so letting them park was fine. Now the author has a car, but their brother parks there. The neighbor wanted to build a porch on half the front garden, which was refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the same area, claiming the council allowed it. The author called their brother to park there, leading to confrontation.\n\nLegal aspects: In the UK, if the house is council-owned, the garden (front and back) is typically considered part of the property, but ownership might be different. If the author is a tenant, their rights over the garden might be limited. The neighbor claiming council permission could be valid if the council agreed. However, if the author's garden is part of their tenancy agreement, the council can't just allow another tenant to take part of it without considering that. Maybe the council made a mistake in granting permission.\n\nMoral aspects: The author allowed parking for years, which could imply a mutual understanding. When the neighbor tried to build a porch first, the author refused. Then the neighbor tried another plan (driveway) with council permission, leading to the author taking a hard stance. The author's action of calling their brother to park there to block the driveway might be seen as a provocation. However, the neighbor's repeated encroachment could justify the author's actions if they feel their property rights are being violated.\n\nThe key points are tenancy rights, council permissions, and mutual understanding. If the author doesn't own the house but rents it, their ability to let others park might be part of their lease. The council's role is crucial here; if they approved the neighbor's driveway without considering the author's tenancy, that's a problem. The author's response was to park their brother's car to block the driveway, which might be seen as a defensive move. The neighbor's entitlement is questionable, but the author's method of confrontation could be seen as aggressive. \n\nIn the UK, tenants don't own the property, so the council's approval of the neighbor's driveway might be the main issue. If the council allowed it without the author's consent, that's a problem. The author's actions might be justified if they believe their rights are being infringed. However, the initial permission to park for years could be seen as tacit agreement, but the neighbor's new construction is a different issue. The author might be in the right to stop the driveway if the council's permission was invalid. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as a response to protect their property under their tenancy. However, using a brother to park and confront the neighbor might be seen as aggressive. The neighbor's entitlement to build without consent is problematic. The author's stance is about defending their rights, even if they are a tenant. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) if the council's permission was improperly given, but if the author had allowed parking long enough to imply ownership, maybe they are in the wrong. But since the author is a tenant and the neighbor is trying to take part of the garden without consent, the author's actions are defensible. So the answer would be B.\n"
