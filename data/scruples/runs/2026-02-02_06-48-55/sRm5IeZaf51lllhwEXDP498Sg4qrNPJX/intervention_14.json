I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway on the author's property. The author has been allowing the neighbors to park in their spot for years when they didn't have a car. Now, the neighbor is trying to take half the garden for a driveway without the author's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. Since the author is a tenant, not the owner, this might complicate things. But in the UK, even as a tenant, you usually have the right to use the property as per the lease. If the neighbor is trying to build on the author's garden, that's a big deal because it's someone else's property. The author can't let them do that without permission from the council or the landlord, right?\n\nThe author turned down the neighbor's request to take half the garden for a porch. Then the neighbor stopped greeting them, but kept using the parking spot. The author then told their brother to park there to block the neighbors. The neighbor's husband got angry when the brother parked. The author's action here was to reclaim their parking spot after refusing the neighbor's driveway request.\n\nBut wait, the author had allowed the neighbors to park there for years. Now they're changing their mind. Is that fair? The neighbor might feel they had an informal agreement. The author's brother parking there was a bit of a confrontation. However, if the author has the right to control their property, even if they're a tenant, they can decide who parks there. The council owns the house, so maybe they need to sort it out with them.\n\nThe real issue is the neighbor building a driveway on the author's garden without permission. The author is right to stop that. But regarding the parking spot, if it's the author's allocated space, they can control access. The neighbor might have assumed it was okay since they've been parking there for years, but the author can change that. The author's actions in blocking the spot might be justified because they're asserting their rights to their property. However, the neighbor's entitlement to build a driveway without consent is definitely wrong.\n\nSo, the author's actions in stopping the driveway and reclaiming the parking spot might be justified. They might not be in the wrong, especially since the neighbor was overstepping. But maybe the author should have handled it more diplomatically instead of parking their brother there. Still, the main conflict is the neighbor's unauthorized actions. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their property and rights.\n"
