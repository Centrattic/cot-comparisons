I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbor park in their spot. The situation is a bit complex. The neighbor has four cars and has been using the author's parking spot for years when the author didn't have a car. Now that the author has a car, they're refusing parking. Also, the neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch, and then the author had their brother park there to block them.\n\nFirst, property rights. The author rents the house from the council, so they don't own it. But the parking spot is part of their rented property? If the front garden is part of the rented house, then the council's permission might matter. But the neighbor claims the council gave permission, but the author doesn't consent. That's a problem because even if the council allows it, the author might have a say if the garden is their rented space.\n\nThe parking spot: if the spot is part of the property the author rents, then they have the right to use it as they see fit. The neighbors were using it for years when the author didn't need it, but now that the author has a car, they can't be forced to let others park there. The author isn't being an asshole by changing their mind, especially since they own (or rent) the space.\n\nThe neighbor's request to take half the garden for a driveway without the author's consent is a trespass. Even if the council says yes, if the author is the tenant, they might have rights to prevent that. The author has the right to protect their property.\n\nCalling the council is a good move. The author also had their brother park there to block the neighbor, which might be a bit confrontational, but it's a way to assert their right. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong if they have the right to the space. The neighbors were using it without permission for years, but that doesn't give them a legal right now. The author is within their rights to stop it.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are protecting their property rights and the neighbor's entitlement is unwarranted.\n"
