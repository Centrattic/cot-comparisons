I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor using their parking spot and then a dispute over building a driveway.\n\nSo the author has been letting the neighbor's family park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Then the neighbor's wife asked to take half the garden for a porch, which was refused. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming permission from the council. The author is upset and had their brother park there to prevent the neighbor from using the spot anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In the UK, if the author is a tenant, the council owns the property. The neighbor can't just take part of the garden without proper authorization. The author might not have the right to give consent. If the council said it's allowed, maybe the neighbor is within their rights, but the author is a tenant, so maybe the council can't just give permission to the neighbor without the tenant's consent. That's a bit unclear.\n\nSocially, the author allowed the parking for years, but when the neighbor became a problem, they decided to stop. That could be seen as a boundary being set. However, the method used\u2014having their brother park there after years of free use\u2014might come off as a bit harsh or a power move. The neighbor's family was using the spot, and the author's sudden refusal could be seen as a change in policy that's causing conflict.\n\nThe key points are: the author's ownership status (tenant), the neighbor's actions (building without consent), and the author's response (using a relative to reclaim the spot). If the neighbor is not legally allowed to build the driveway without the author's consent, then the author's action is justified. But if the neighbor has a valid claim from the council, then the author is in the wrong for blocking access.\n\nAlso, the author didn't own the house, so they can't give permission for the neighbor's driveway. The neighbor's claim of council permission might not be valid if the council can't assign part of the garden without the tenant's agreement. The author is trying to stop the neighbor from taking the garden, which they have a right to do as a tenant.\n\nIn terms of the parking, the author changed the policy after a conflict, which might not be fair, but they have the right to their property. The neighbor's entitlement in trying to take the garden is more concerning. The author's actions, while possibly abrupt, are defending their property. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. The neighbor's attempts to take the garden without consent are problematic, and the author is acting to protect their space. However, the way they enforced the parking ban (using a relative) could be seen as a bit of a retaliatory move, which might not be the best approach, but not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B (author is not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The main wrongdoer seems to be the neighbor trying to take the garden. The author is standing up for their rights.\n"
