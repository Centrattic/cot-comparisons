I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to let their neighbors park in their spot and then confronting them after the neighbor tried to build a driveway on their garden.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they've lived in the house for 18 years and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. Initially, they allowed the neighbors to park in their spot because they didn't have a car. Now that they do have a car, they're stopping the parking. That part is understandable\u2014using your own property as you see fit, especially when circumstances change.\n\nThen there's the issue of the neighbor wanting to take half the garden for a porch. The author refused, which is their right since they don't own the house but rent it. The council owns the house, so maybe the neighbor approached the council incorrectly. The author mentions the council gave permission, but the author didn't consent. That's a problem because even if the council gave permission, the property might still belong to the council, and the tenant (the author) might have some rights to the garden.\n\nNow, when the neighbor starts building the driveway without the author's consent, the author calls their brother to park the car there. The husband then confronts the brother. The author then tells the neighbors they can't park there anymore. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't own the house, so maybe their rights over the garden are limited. If the council gave permission to the neighbor, the author's refusal might not hold up. But the neighbor didn't get proper permission from the council, and the author is trying to stop them. Also, the author allowed parking for years, so the neighbor might have assumed it was okay. However, the author has the right to revoke that permission. But if the council's permission is valid, the author's rights might be overridden.\n\nThe key points are: the author's tenancy rights, the council's ownership, and whether the neighbor followed proper procedures. If the council did approve the driveway, the author might be in the wrong for opposing it. However, if the council didn't get the author's consent (since the property is the council's but the tenant uses the garden), there might be a conflict. \n\nThe author's action of parking their brother's car to block the spot could be seen as aggressive, especially if the neighbor had a valid right. But if the neighbor's actions are unauthorized, the author is just protecting their property. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to use their rented property and can revoke parking access. The neighbor shouldn't have taken over the garden without proper approval. The author's response was within their rights to protect their space.\n"
