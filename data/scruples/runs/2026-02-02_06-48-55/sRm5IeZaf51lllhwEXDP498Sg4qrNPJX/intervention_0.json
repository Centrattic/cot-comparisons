I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about parking spots and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway. The author has allowed their neighbor's family to park in their spot for years while they didn't have a car. Now that they do, they're refusing to let the neighbor park there anymore. Also, the neighbor tried to take half the garden for a porch and then a driveway, which the author is against.\n\nFirst, the parking spot: if the author is renting the house, they don't own the property. So maybe the parking arrangement isn't something they can just change without the landlord's say-so. But the neighbor was using it without permission. The author allowed it for years, which might imply some kind of informal agreement. Now, when the author wants to use the spot themselves, they're stopping the neighbor. Is that fair? It depends on whether the neighbor had any right to use it in the first place. If the spot is part of the rented property, the author might have the right to use it once they have a car, especially since they allowed it out of kindness before.\n\nThen there's the driveway issue. The neighbor claims the council gave permission to take half the garden. The author doesn't consent. Since it's a rented property, the council might be involved in some way. The author trying to block it by parking their brother's car might be a problem, especially if the neighbor actually has a legal right to do that. The author's brother parking there could lead to a conflict, maybe even legal issues if the neighbor has the right.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. They could be in the wrong if the neighbor had proper permissions for the driveway. Also, the parking spot's usage might depend on whether the author can legally restrict access. Since it's a rental, the council's rules might govern that. The author's brother parking there could be an issue if the spot isn't officially theirs to control. \n\nThe neighbor's behavior in stopping greetings after being refused the porch is poor, but the author's response of blocking parking might be seen as escalating the conflict. The author might be in the right about the driveway if the neighbor didn't actually get permission, but if the neighbor did, then the author's actions could be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author did allow parking for years, so changing that now might be reasonable. But using force or their brother to park could be crossing a line. So maybe the author is in the wrong for using aggressive tactics even if their stance on the parking is understandable.\n"
