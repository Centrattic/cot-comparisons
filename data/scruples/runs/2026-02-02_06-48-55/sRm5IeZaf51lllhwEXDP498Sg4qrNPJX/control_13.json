I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to let neighbors park in their free spot. The situation is in the UK, so I need to consider UK property laws here.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbors to park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Now they have a brother with a car who uses the spot. The neighbor tried to take half of the garden for a porch, which the author refused. Then the neighbor claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway on the author's garden, which is part of the property the council owns.\n\nThe key points are: the author is a tenant, not the owner, so the council owns the property. The neighbor's claim of permission from the council is important. In the UK, if you're a tenant, you might have certain rights over the property, but the council's approval would usually be needed for any structural changes like a driveway. However, the author might not have ownership rights, so maybe the council can allow the neighbor to take part of the garden if they agree. But the author is now using the spot for their own use with the brother's car, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there to block the neighbors might be problematic. If the neighbor has legitimate council permission, then the author might be interfering with that. But if the council didn't actually grant permission, the author could be protecting their own rights. The neighbor's entitlement is an issue, but the author's response (using a car to block parking) might escalate things. \n\nWait, the author says they don't own the house, just rent it. So the front garden might be part of the property the council owns. If the council allowed the neighbor to build a driveway, maybe the author doesn't have the right to object, unless the council's permission requires the tenant's consent. That's unclear. But the author is trying to stop the neighbor, which could lead to legal issues. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's family had been using the spot for years. The author might have allowed that as a neighborly favor, but now they need it for their own use. The neighbor's entitlement is questionable if she's trying to take over the garden without the author's consent. But if the council approved her building a driveway, the author might not be in the right to block it. \n\nThe author's action of using their brother's car to prevent parking might be a bit aggressive. The neighbor was already using the spot, so maybe the author should have addressed that before taking such a step. But the neighbor's claim of permission is a red flag. The author should contact the council to clarify the situation rather than taking unilateral action. \n\nSo, the author is in the right to refuse the neighbor's parking now that they need the space, but the way they handled it by parking a car might be an issue. Also, the driveway permission from the council is a separate matter. The main question is whether the author has the right to object to the driveway if the council approved it. Since the author is a tenant, maybe they don't have a say. But if the garden is part of the rented property, the tenant might have some rights. \n\nIn the UK, tenants usually have rights over the property they rent, but making structural changes like a driveway would require the council's permission. If the council allowed it, the author might not be able to stop it. However, the neighbor's initial request to take half the garden was denied, and now she's claiming permission. The author is correct in contacting the council to verify. \n\nThe parking spot issue: if the neighbors were using it without permission for years, the author can stop that now. But if the council allows the driveway, the spot might be part of that. The author's action of parking their brother's car could be seen as a reasonable way to enforce their current use, but it's a bit of a confrontational method. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to let the neighbors park there now, especially after the neighbor's aggressive request for the garden. However, the driveway issue is separate and the author might need to check with the council to see if the neighbor actually has the right. The parking action is justified if the author is now using the spot, but maybe not the best approach. \n\nOverall, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to use their parking spot once it's needed, and the neighbor's entitlement to the garden is uncertain without proper council approval. The author's actions, while a bit confrontational, are in their own defense.\n"
