I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation revolves around parking and property disputes with the neighbors.\n\nFirst, the author has a parking spot. The neighbors have four cars and parked in the spot for years while the author didn't have a car. Then, the author gets a car (via their brother) and decides to take back the spot. They refuse to let the neighbors park there anymore. The neighbor (the wife) also tried to build a driveway on part of the author's garden, which the author rejected. The author then calls the brother to park there to enforce the claim.\n\nLegal ownership is a key point. The author rents the house from the council, so the garden is part of the rented property. If the council owns the garden, the neighbor can't build on it without the council's approval. The author didn't consent, so the neighbor building without permission is likely an issue. The author's refusal to let them park is about their own property. \n\nBut in the UK, if the parking spot is on the author's property, they can control who parks there. The neighbors using it for years could imply a possible right, but since the author was there first and it's their property, they can change their mind. The neighbor's entitlement to build on the garden without consent is a separate issue. The author is protecting their own space, so they might not be in the wrong. The key is whether the author's actions exceed reasonable use. Telling their brother to park there to enforce the claim might be a bit of a strong move, but it's their property. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
