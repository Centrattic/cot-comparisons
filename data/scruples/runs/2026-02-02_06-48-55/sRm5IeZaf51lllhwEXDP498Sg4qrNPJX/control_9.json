I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after refusing their neighbors from parking in their spot and dealing with a dispute over a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years. The neighbors have four cars, and the author didn't have a car at first. But now, the author does have a brother with a car. The neighbors tried to take half the garden for a porch, which was denied. Then the wife tried to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming permission from the council. The author refused and had their brother park there to block them. The husband then confronted them.\n\nIn the UK, property ownership is important. The author mentions they rent the house, so the council actually owns it. If the council owns the house, then the garden is likely part of their property. The neighbor claiming the council gave permission might have some legal standing if they have a right of way or an easement. However, the author might not have the right to the garden if the council allows it. \n\nBut the parking spot in question is the author's spot. Even if the garden is a shared area, the parking spot is free and allocated to the author. The neighbors used it for years, but the author can change their mind. The author's action of parking their brother's car there to stop the neighbors isn't illegal, just asserting their right to the spot. \n\nHowever, the neighbor's claim about building a driveway on the garden is a separate issue. If the council has given permission, the author's refusal might not stop the construction. The author should involve the council to resolve the dispute rather than taking unilateral action. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing the parking space, but the driveway issue needs to be handled through the council. The action of parking the brother's car is a reasonable assertion of their right to the spot. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
