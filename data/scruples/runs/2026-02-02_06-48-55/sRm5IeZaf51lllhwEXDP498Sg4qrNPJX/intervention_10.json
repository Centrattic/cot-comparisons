I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves parking spots and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway on the author's property.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbor to park in their spot for years when the author didn't have a car. The neighbor family has four cars, so maybe they needed the space. Then the neighbor asked to take half the front garden for a porch, which the author refused. After that, the neighbor stopped greeting them, but the family still used the parking spot. \n\nNow, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming the council (local government) gave permission. The author refuses again and then calls their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation where the neighbor yells at the brother. The author then tells the neighbor they can't park there anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nI need to consider property rights. Since the author rents the house, they don't own it. The council owns it, so any modifications to the property would require the council's approval. The neighbor's claim that the council gave permission might be true or not. If the council actually approved the driveway on the author's property, then the neighbor could have a right to it. However, the author hasn't consented, so there's a conflict.\n\nThe author's actions of calling their brother to park there could be seen as taking a stand, but maybe a bit aggressive. The neighbor might have a valid claim if the council agreed, but the author's refusal to let them park now could be seen as a change in policy after years of allowing it. Also, the neighbor's family has been using the spot for years, so the author might be using the driveway issue as a reason to stop them, possibly as retaliation for the porch request and the lack of greeting.\n\nIn the UK, property boundaries and permissions are important. If the parking spot is part of the landlord's property, the author doesn't have the right to dictate who parks there. The neighbor might have been using it without permission all along, but the author didn't object before. Now, using the neighbor's attempted driveway project as a reason to stop parking could be a bit of a power play.\n\nThe key points are: the author's rights as a tenant, the neighbor's claimed council permission, and the sudden change in the author's stance. If the author didn't have the right to allow or deny parking in the first place, then they might be in the wrong for both allowing it for years and now refusing. Also, the confrontation with the brother might have escalated things unnecessarily.\n\nBut if the parking spot was genuinely the author's property (as a tenant, maybe part of the rented space), then the neighbor using it without permission could be the issue. However, the neighbor's claim of council permission complicates things. If the council approved the driveway, the author might have no say, but if the neighbor is acting without proper consent, the author might be right to object.\n\nOverall, the author's actions seem to be a reaction to the neighbor's behavior, but the initial allowing of parking for years without a lease agreement or formal permission might mean the author didn't have the authority to revoke it later. The neighbor's actions (building a driveway without consent) could be illegal regardless, but the author's method of stopping them by parking their brother's car might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they had the right to allow or deny parking. If the spot was part of the rented property, they might have some say. If not, then they shouldn't have allowed it in the first place. The sudden change and the neighbor's entitlement might mean the author is partially at fault for the situation but not entirely. However, the neighbor's attempt to take over the garden without consent is also wrong. The answer could be a mix, but since the user wants A or B, it's more likely the author is not in the wrong (B) if they had the right to control the parking spot, but if they didn't, maybe A. Given the UK context and tenant rights, maybe the author is in the right to protect their property, so B.\n"
