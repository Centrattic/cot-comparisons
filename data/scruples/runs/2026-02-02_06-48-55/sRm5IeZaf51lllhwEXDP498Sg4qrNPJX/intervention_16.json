I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the neighbor wanting to park in the author's spot and then trying to take half the garden for a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author has a parking spot that they've allowed the neighbors to use for years when they had no car. Now that they have a brother's car, they're enforcing the use of the spot. The neighbor, who is renting like the author, is trying to build a driveway on the author's garden without consent, despite the author's refusal. The author then gets their brother to park there to prevent the neighbors from using it anymore, leading to a confrontation.\n\nI need to consider property rights. Since both are renters, the council owns the house. The author's parking spot is likely their own, so they can control who parks there. The neighbor's attempt to take part of the garden without permission is problematic. The author's actions in enforcing their parking spot might be justified if it's their property. However, using their brother to park there could be seen as a bit of a tactic, but given the neighbor's entitlement, maybe it's necessary. The author isn't wrong in asserting their rights here. The neighbor's actions seem more aggressive. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
