I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a parking spot and their neighbor has been using it for years. The author didn't have a car initially, so they let the neighbors park there. Then, the neighbor's wife asked to take part of the author's front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. Now, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming permission from the council. The author got angry and had their brother park in the spot, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author mentions they rent the house, so technically the council owns it. If the council owns the house, they might be the ones responsible for any changes to the property. If the neighbor got permission from the council to build a driveway on the author's garden, that might be valid unless the author has a specific agreement. But the author didn't consent, so there could be a conflict here.\n\nThe author allowed the neighbors to park there for years. Even though it was a free spot, once they had a car, they took advantage. But the author now wants to stop them, especially after the neighbor's request for the garden. The author's action of having their brother park there to block the neighbors could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legally, if the parking spot is part of the rented property, maybe the council has control. If the author isn't the owner, they might not have full authority to restrict parking. However, since they've been allowing it for years, maybe there's an implied agreement. \n\nThe neighbor's attempt to build on the author's garden without consent is another issue. Even if the council approved it, the author might have the right to object. But the author's response of using their brother to park there could escalate the situation. It's possible that the author is within their rights to stop the neighbors from parking if they no longer want to allow it. However, the method used (having a brother park there) might not be the best way. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they are asserting their property rights, especially since they are the ones who have been in the house longer. But the fact that they are a tenant might complicate things. If the council owns the property, the author's rights might be limited. The neighbor's actions without the author's consent are also problematic. The author's actions could be justified as self-help, but it's a bit of a gray area. I think the author is not in the wrong because they are protecting their property, even if they are a tenant. The neighbor's actions are more questionable. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
