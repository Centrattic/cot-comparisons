I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor trying to park in the author's parking spot and then attempting to build a driveway on part of the author's property. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they have allowed the neighbors to park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now that they have a car, they've asked the neighbor to stop using the spot. The neighbor, however, is trying to take up half of the garden for a driveway despite the author not owning the property (it's rented from the council). \n\nIn the UK, parking spaces in front of properties can sometimes be considered part of the property's boundary. If the author rents the house, the council might have specific rules about what can be done with the front garden. The neighbor claiming permission from the council could be a red flag if it's not actually the case. \n\nThe author's response was to park their brother's car there to block the neighbors. This might be seen as a stand-up for their property rights, but since they don't own the house, maybe there's a different legal perspective. However, the neighbor's actions of potentially building without consent could be the main issue here.\n\nThe key points are whether the author's actions (parking their brother's car) were justified. Since the author was previously allowing the parking, they might have a history of tolerance. But now that they need the space, they're asserting their right. The neighbor's entitlement to take part of the garden without permission is likely the bigger problem. \n\nIn terms of legal standing, the council's role is important here. If the neighbor is building without proper authorization, the author's action to prevent construction by parking there might be seen as a temporary measure. However, the author's approach might not be the most legally sound, but the neighbor's actions are the main issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are a reaction to the neighbor's overreach. They might not be in the wrong as they're protecting their rented space. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
