I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. I need to analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting their neighbor park in their spot for years. The neighbor has four cars, and the author didn't have a car initially. That seems okay. But now, the author gets a car and needs the spot. The neighbor's family continued using the spot even after the author started having a car. \n\nThen, the neighbor's wife asked to build a porch on the author's garden, which was denied. The author mentions they rent the house, so the council owns it. The neighbor then claims the council gave permission to build a driveway on the author's garden. The author refuses, leading to the neighbor trying to proceed. \n\nThe author's response was to have their brother park there, which led to a confrontation. The author is upset about the neighbor's actions and wants to stop the driveway. \n\nNow, considering the UK situation: if the author rents the house, they don't own the property. So, any changes to the property would typically require the landlord's (council's) permission. The neighbor claiming permission from the council might be a key point. If the council did approve the neighbor's driveway, that could affect the author's rights. \n\nBut the author is trying to prevent the neighbor from taking their garden. However, if the author doesn't own the property, maybe the council's decision is more binding. Also, the author's use of the parking spot: if it's not officially their spot, just a space they've allowed use of, maybe they can't claim ownership. \n\nThe author's action of having their brother park there might be a way to enforce their claim, but if there's no legal right to the spot, that could be problematic. The neighbor's entitlement in taking half the garden is a separate issue, but the author's response (blocking the neighbor's access) could be seen as escalating the conflict without legal justification.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not have clear rights to the parking spot, especially if it's on council property. Their refusal to let the neighbor park could be within their rights if they've been using it, but if the neighbor has council permission, the author's actions might be wrong. The author's decision to use a brother to park there could be seen as aggressive without legal standing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by asserting control over a space they don't legally own and escalating the situation. Answer A.\n"
