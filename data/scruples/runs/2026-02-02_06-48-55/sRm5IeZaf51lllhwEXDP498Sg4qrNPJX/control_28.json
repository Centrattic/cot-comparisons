I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor using their parking spot and then trying to take half the garden for a driveway. The author is in the UK, renting from the council.\n\nFirst, the neighbor had been using the parking spot for years. The author didn't own the house, so maybe there's some council rules about parking. The neighbor's family used the spot even after the author said no to the porch. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the garden without consent. The author then told their brother to park there to block the neighbor, leading to conflict.\n\nIn the UK, council property ownership matters. If the house is council-owned, the garden might be part of the property, but usage rights can be tricky. The neighbor claiming council permission could be a red flag. The author might not have the legal right to let others park there long-term, especially if it's council property. However, the neighbor's actions of building without consent are problematic. The author's response was to block the spot, which could be seen as asserting their rights, but since they don't own the property, maybe they shouldn't have allowed parking in the first place. The key is whether the author had the right to grant parking access. If the council owns the garden, the neighbor building there without proper approval is an issue. The author might be in the right to stop both the parking and the construction, especially if unauthorized. But initially allowing parking could be a mistake. Need to check if the author had permission to let the neighbor park. If not, then the author was wrong to let it happen. But since the neighbor is overstepping now, the author's actions to reclaim the spot might be justified. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the neighbor is being overreaching and the author is asserting their rights, even if they didn't own the property. The council's permission for the driveway is questionable, so the author acting to prevent construction is correct.\n"
