I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about parking and a neighbor trying to take part of the author's garden. The author has been letting the neighbors park in their spot for years because they didn't have a car. Then the neighbor asked for half the front garden for a porch, which the author denied. Now the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on the author's property, claiming the council gave permission. The author got angry and had their brother park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author doesn't own the house, it's a rental from the council. So they don't have legal ownership of the garden. If the council owns it, then the neighbor can't just take part of it without proper authorization. But if the council did give permission, maybe the author's rights are limited. But the author didn't consent, so even if the council approved, maybe there's a process to follow. The author should probably check with the council themselves to confirm, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThen the parking issue: the author allowed the neighbors to park for years when they had no car. Now that the author has a car (since the brother came to park), they're refusing. But if the parking spot is part of the rented property, maybe it's included in the tenancy agreement. If the neighbors were parking there without permission, even if it was tacit, maybe the author can't just revoke access suddenly. However, since the author was the one allowing it, they have the right to stop. But they did have a brother park there, which might be seen as a bit of a provocation move.\n\nThe neighbor's actions: trying to take half the garden without consent is definitely problematic. Even if the council approved, the author might have a right to object, especially since they're the tenant. The author's response was to have a car parked to block the spot, which could be seen as a civil disobedience tactic. But since the author doesn't own the property, perhaps using a car to block access could be illegal, especially if it's public space.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for asserting their rights, but their method (having someone park there to enforce the rule) could be questionable. However, since the neighbor was acting without the author's consent and possibly misrepresenting council permission, the author's actions are more about self-defense of their property. The main issue is whether the author has the legal standing to stop the neighbor from taking the garden, which might require them to contact the council as they mentioned. The parking part is a bit of a gray area since the author allowed it for years, but they can revoke that permission. The confrontation with the brother might be seen as a bit aggressive, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for asserting their rights.\n"
