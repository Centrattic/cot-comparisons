I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after refusing their neighbor from parking in their spot and confronting them over building a driveway.\n\nFirst, the author allows their neighbor to park in their spot for years when they had no car. Then, the neighbor's wife asks to take half the garden for a porch, which the author declines. The wife then stops greeting them, but the family continues using the parking spot. The author rents the house, so they don't own it, but they might have a de facto right to the garden if the council doesn't own it. The neighbor claims council permission to take half the garden for a driveway, but the author opposes it and then parks their brother's car there to block the family. The husband yells, and the author tells them to stop parking there.\n\nKey points: The author allowed parking for years, but now wants to stop. The neighbor claims council permission, but the author disputes it. The author's response is to park their brother's car there, leading to confrontation. \n\nIn the UK, if the property is council-owned, the garden might be part of the property rights even when renting. However, allowing others to park on a rented property's land might not be enforceable if the tenant isn't the owner. The neighbor using the spot without explicit permission could be a problem. The author's confrontation via parking their brother's car might be seen as aggressive. Also, the neighbor's claim of council permission needs verification. The author's actions might be justified in asserting their rights, but using their brother to park could be seen as an escalation. The neighbor's entitlement in building a driveway without owner consent could be an issue, but the author's method of response may be too confrontational. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The council's role is important here; if the neighbor has legal permission, the author might be in the wrong for blocking. However, if the council's permission is invalid, the author's stance could be justified. The initial allowance of parking might also affect the situation. The answer hinges on property rights and methods of conflict resolution.\n"
