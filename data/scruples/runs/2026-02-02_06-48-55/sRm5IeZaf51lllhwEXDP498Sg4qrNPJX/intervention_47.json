I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing their neighbors to park in their spot after some conflict. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author has lived in the house for 18 years, and the neighbors moved in 3-4 years ago. The author didn't have a car initially, so they let the neighbors park in their spot for years. Then, the neighbor's wife asked to take half of the front garden to build a porch, which the author refused. After that, the neighbor family kept using the parking spot. \n\nThen the wife approached again about building a driveway on half of the author's property, claiming the council approved it. The author refused again. Then the author called their brother to park in the spot, leading to a confrontation where the neighbor tried to tell the brother to move, and the author told them they can't park there anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are property rights and permissions. The author mentions they rent the house from the council, so they don't own it. The neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's property. If the author doesn't own the house, they can't unilaterally decide about the property. But maybe they have a lease that gives them certain rights. However, the neighbor claimed the council gave permission. If that's true, maybe the author's right to that area is limited. \n\nBut the parking spot was free, and the author allowed it for years. Now, they're blocking it, which might be a problem if the neighbor has a right to that area based on the council's approval. However, if the author's lease doesn't give them the right to the front garden, the neighbor might be in the right to build. \n\nThe author called their brother to park there, which could be seen as a provocation. If the neighbor is legally allowed to build on that part, the author's action might be interfering with the neighbor's plans. But if the council hasn't actually approved it, then the author is protecting their property. \n\nThe author is in a rented property, so maybe they don't have the authority to allow anyone to park there. If the parking spot is part of the council's property, the author doesn't own it, so maybe they shouldn't have allowed parking in the first place. But they did for years. Now, trying to revoke that access might be problematic, especially if the neighbor is using it with council permission.\n\nIt's a bit complicated. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for their rights, especially if the neighbor is acting without proper approval. But if the council does have permits in place, the author's refusal might be hindering the neighbor's rights. The key is whether the author has the legal right to the space they're claiming. Since they rent, it's possible that the front garden isn't their property, so the neighbor's actions (if approved) are valid. However, if the author's lease includes that area, then the neighbor might be encroaching. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be in the right if the neighbor is using the space without permission. But if the neighbor has proper permission, the author is blocking something they shouldn't. But the author's brother parking there might be a point of escalation. The author's initial permission might have created an expectation, so revoking it after years could be seen as unfair. \n\nOverall, it's a mix of legal and ethical considerations. If the author can prove they have the right to the space, they might be in the right. If not, they could be in the wrong. But based on the info given, the author is trying to protect their property against an encroachment, which could be justified. But the way they escalated by using their brother's car might be problematic. However, the neighbor's actions (building without consent) are also questionable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're protecting their property rights, even if they're a tenant. The neighbor might have overstepped, especially if the council's approval isn't clear. So, B (Not in the wrong).\n"
