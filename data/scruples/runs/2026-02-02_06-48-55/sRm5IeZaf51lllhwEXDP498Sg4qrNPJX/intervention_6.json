I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did the right thing by refusing their neighbor to park in their spot and then having their brother park there.\n\nFirst, the author has been allowing the neighbor to park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now they have a brother with a car, so they took back the spot. The neighbor tried to take over part of the garden for a driveway without the author's consent. The author called the brother in to park there and confronted the neighbor when she tried to get her husband to move the car.\n\nIn the UK, council-owned houses usually have specific rules about parking. If the parking spot is part of the property the tenant rents, then the tenant might have some rights there. But if the spot isn't officially assigned to them, it could be a shared space. The neighbor might have a case if the parking spot isn't clearly the author's. However, the author had been allowing the neighbor to use it for years, which might imply some informal agreement. But when the author needed it, they took it back, which is their right if they own the spot.\n\nThe bigger issue is the neighbor trying to build a driveway on the author's garden without consent. The author is correct in resisting that, especially since they don't own the house and the council's permission might not be sufficient. The author's action of having their brother park there to assert ownership could be seen as standing up for their rights, but if the parking spot isn't officially theirs, it's a problem. However, given the long-standing use and the author's recent need, they might have a valid claim. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
