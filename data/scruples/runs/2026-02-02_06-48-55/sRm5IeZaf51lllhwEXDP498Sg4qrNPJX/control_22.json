I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for refusing their neighbor to park in their free spot.\n\nFirst, the author has been letting the neighbor park there for years because they didn't have a car. Then the neighbor asked to take half the garden for a porch, which was declined. The neighbor then started ignoring the author. The author mentions that the neighbor's family kept using the spot even after the request. Now, the neighbor is trying to build a driveway on half of the author's garden, claiming council permission, but the author doesn't own the house\u2014it's owned by the council. The author then calls their brother to park there, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are property ownership and permissions. Since the author is a renter, the council owns the property. If the neighbor got permission from the council to build a driveway, that might be valid. But the author's garden is part of the property they rent, so they can't just give permission for someone else to take it. However, the neighbor's claim of council permission needs to be verified.\n\nThe author's action of calling their brother to park there might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Even if they're upset, using a friend to park could escalate things. The author's refusal to let the neighbor park isn't the issue, but their method of enforcing it might be. Also, the neighbor's entitlement in trying to take half the garden without the property owner's consent is problematic. But the author's response could be seen as aggressive, especially if the council's permission is legitimate. The author should probably contact the council first to resolve the driveway issue properly rather than blocking parking themselves. So, the author might be in the wrong for confronting the neighbor directly instead of going through proper channels.\n"
