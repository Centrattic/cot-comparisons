I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about parking and property disputes with a neighbor. \n\nFirst, the user (the author) has been allowing the neighbors to park in their spot for years because they had no car. Now that they have a brother's car, they're refusing. The neighbor, who recently asked to take half the garden for a porch (denied) and later tried to build a driveway on the author's property, is causing conflict.\n\nThe key points are ownership and permissions. The author rents the house, so they don't own the property. The council owns it. The neighbor claims the council gave permission for the driveway. If that's true, maybe the author doesn't have the authority to block it. But the author isn't consenting and might be right to object since they don't own the property. \n\nHowever, the author allowed the neighbors to park there for years. Now suddenly changing the arrangement could be seen as a problem. The neighbor's family used the spot without permission after the author's refusal to let the porch. Maybe there's an implied agreement over time. But the author isn't the owner, so maybe they can't allow or deny parking in the first place. \n\nThe council's role is crucial here. If the neighbor got permission from the council to build on the author's garden, the author might not have the legal right to stop that. The author's brother parking there might not be a valid deterrent if the council's approval is in place. \n\nSo the author's actions might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their rental property's boundaries, but they might be overstepping if the council has already given permission. The neighbor's entitlement in taking half the garden is problematic. But the author's refusal to let them park now after years of allowing it could be seen as a shift without prior communication. \n\nIn the UK, parking arrangements in rental properties can be tricky. If the parking spot is part of the council's property, the tenant (author) might not have the authority to allow or deny parking. The neighbor's actions could be unlawful if they're building without proper consent, but the author's response (brother parking) might not be the right approach. \n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong because they're asserting their rights as a tenant, but they should involve the council to resolve both the parking and the driveway issue. The neighbor's actions need to be checked legally. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's complexity around the property ownership and permissions.\n"
