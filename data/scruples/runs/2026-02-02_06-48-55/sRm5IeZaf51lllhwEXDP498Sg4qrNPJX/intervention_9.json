I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about parking spots and some construction plans. The author has a parking spot, and the neighbors have been using it for years because the author didn't have a car. Now the author has a car, so they want to use their spot. The neighbor, the wife, asked to build a porch on half of the author's front garden, which the author refused. Then the neighbor tried to build a driveway on the author's property without permission, and the author made their brother park there to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author mentions they rent the house, so they don't own the property. The council owns it. So maybe the author doesn't have the final say on how the garden is used. But the neighbor is claiming the council gave permission. If that's true, maybe the neighbor is within their rights to build the driveway. But the author hasn't consented, which might be a problem if the council didn't actually approve it.\n\nThen there's the parking spot. If the spot is part of the rented property, the author should have the right to use it. The neighbors were using it for years, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. If the author's lease doesn't specify shared parking, they might have the right to use their spot. However, allowing others to park there for years could be seen as an informal agreement, or maybe the neighbors assumed it was permissible.\n\nThe author's response to the neighbor's driveway plan was making their brother park there. This could be seen as taking a stand to protect their property, but if the council allows the neighbor to build, the author might be interfering with a legal process. Also, the husband yelling at the brother might be an escalation.\n\nThe neighbor's actions of building a driveway without the author's consent could be a problem, especially if it's against the council's rules. But the neighbor claims they have permission, so the author should check with the council to confirm.\n\nIn terms of the parking spot, if the author's lease doesn't restrict them from using their own spot, they're not in the wrong. However, if the neighbors were using it out of necessity and the author suddenly blocks them, it might seem harsh. The author's decision to stop them after years of use could be seen as a change in stance without prior notice, which might be a point against them.\n\nBut considering the neighbor's entitlement in taking over the garden, the author is protecting their own rights. The key here is whether the author has the right to the parking spot and the garden. Since they rent, the council's rules are crucial. If the author has the right to use the spot, then they're justified in stopping the neighbors. If the neighbor's driveway construction is approved, the author might need to address that separately with the council.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is trying to protect their property (their spot and garden) from being taken without consent. Even though they allowed parking for years, they're within their rights to change that. The neighbor's actions might be overstepping, especially if they don't have proper permission. The author's response, while maybe abrupt, is a defense of their property. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check for any legal nuances in the UK regarding rented properties and shared spaces.\n"
