I have lived inside this house for the past 18 years, they moved in about 3/4 years ago. At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I\u2019m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don\u2019t have porch where you can just park your car, it\u2019s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I\u2019d like to note that I don\u2019t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don\u2019t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about parking spots and a neighbor wanting to build a driveway on half of their front garden. The author has been letting the neighbor park in their spot for years, even before they had a car. Now that the author's brother is parking there, the neighbor is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author mentions they rent the house from the council, so they don't own the property. The neighbor claims the council gave her permission to build a driveway on half of the author's garden. If the council is involved, maybe there's an official process here. The author might not have the legal right to stop her if the council approved it, but they could have a say since it's their rented space. But I'm not sure how UK property laws work in rented council houses. Maybe the council has control over the communal areas, and the neighbor is trying to take something that's not entirely hers.\n\nThen there's the parking issue. The author let the neighbor park in their spot for years when they had no car. Now that the author's brother is parking there, the neighbor is being hostile. The author might be within their rights to use their own spot, especially since they're now using it. But if the parking spot is part of the property that the council owns, maybe the author didn't have the right to give the neighbor free parking all those years. That could be a point where the author was in the wrong initially.\n\nThe neighbor's actions of building a driveway without consent could be a problem. The author is trying to stop her from taking over their garden, which seems reasonable. However, the way the author handled it\u2014using their brother to park there and then refusing the neighbor\u2014might come off as aggressive. The neighbor had been using the spot for years, and suddenly cutting them off could be seen as a problem, especially if there's no formal agreement. But maybe the author had the right to change their mind.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's request to take half the garden for a porch was denied, leading to a breakdown in communication. The author might be reacting to the neighbor's entitlement, which is understandable. But the author's solution could be seen as a tit-for-tat approach, which might not be fair. However, if the neighbor is acting without permission from the council, the author is trying to protect their space.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the legal aspects here. Since the author rents from the council, maybe the parking spot is considered part of the property the council owns. If the neighbor was using it with the author's prior consent, the author can't just revoke that without a good reason. But maybe the author's brother parking there is a way to assert ownership now. The neighbor's claim that the council gave her permission might not hold if the author didn't agree. But if the council actually approved the driveway, the author might have no say. This is a bit murky.\n\nIn terms of social norms, refusing to let someone park in your spot after allowing it for years can be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author might have a right to their own space now that they need it. The neighbor's entitlement in wanting the garden is also an issue. The author's actions might be justified in protecting their property, but the aggressive response (using a brother to park there) could be seen as a bit of a power play.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They have a right to their property (even if rented) and are trying to prevent the neighbor from taking over their space. However, their method of cutting off parking suddenly could be seen as harsh, especially after allowing it for years. The neighbor's actions might also be questionable if she's trying to build without proper consent. The answer might depend on the specific legal situation in the UK regarding council property and shared spaces. Since the author is acting to protect their own rights, maybe they're not in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
