So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family dinner where a nephew got into a disagreement over a gym. The nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move, which he refused. The nephew's parents said he was wrong because he was younger, and the author sided with the nephew. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about the gym situation. The nephew was using a machine and someone else asked him to move. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning was based on the nephew being younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in that context.\n\nSo, is the nephew in the wrong? Typically, in gyms, if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. But the situation can vary. If the nephew was taking an unusually long time, maybe the other person had a right to ask. However, the nephew's response\u2014refusing to move because he wasn't done\u2014might be seen as rude, especially if the other person was waiting. But the parents' reasoning about age seems problematic. Age shouldn't determine who gets to use a machine. The author's stance is that both should be equal in that context.\n\nThe author's mistake might be not considering the social norms of gyms. Even if the nephew had a right to be there, the way he responded could affect group dynamics. However, the parents' argument based on age is flawed. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so defending him is a personal choice. But the brother's reaction about respecting elders is more about family dynamics. The author might be in the right in the gym scenario but maybe wrong in the family context, like challenging the brother in front of others. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The answer hinges on the gym etiquette and family respect. The nephew's action might not be wrong if he was just finishing his set, but the parents' reasoning is invalid. The author's support is justified. However, the author's public disagreement might have caused family tension. But the core issue is about the gym situation. Since age shouldn't matter there, the author isn't in the wrong for disagreeing with the parents' reasoning. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
