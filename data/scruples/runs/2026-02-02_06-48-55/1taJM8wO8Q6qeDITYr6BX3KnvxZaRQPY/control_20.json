So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was at fault because he was younger, but the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The nephew was using a machine and hadn't finished his workout yet. The 30-year-old asked him to move, but the nephew declined. The parents argued that since the nephew is younger, the man's time was more important. The author thinks age shouldn't factor into this, and that both have equal right to use the equipment until done.\n\nGym etiquette generally follows the idea that whoever is using the equipment has the right to stay until they're done. There's no rule that older people get priority. The parents' reasoning might stem from a cultural expectation of respecting elders, but in a public setting like a gym, that might not apply in the same way. The author's stance is about fairness based on usage, not age.\n\nThe author's conflict with their brother arises from disagreeing in front of the nephew, which might have come off as undermining the brother's authority as a parent. Even if the author's reasoning is sound, the situation's social dynamics\u2014disagreeing publicly with a sibling\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, the core issue is about whether the nephew was in the wrong, which the author correctly points out isn't about age.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on two parts: the correctness of their reasoning and the manner in which they expressed it. Their reasoning seems valid, but challenging a sibling's parenting in front of others can be seen as tactless. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The main issue is the parents' incorrect assumption about age determining gym etiquette. The author isn't wrong in their stance on the gym issue itself but might have handled the family dynamics poorly. However, the question is specifically about siding with the nephew. Since the author's reasoning is correct, they aren't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout. The brother's offense is about the disagreement in public, not the validity of the argument itself. So the answer is B (No).\n"
