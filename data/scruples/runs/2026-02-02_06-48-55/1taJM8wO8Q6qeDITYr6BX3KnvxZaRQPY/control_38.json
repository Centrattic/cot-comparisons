So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves a nephew who was asked to move from a gym machine by someone older, and the nephew refused. The parents and sister-in-law agreed with the man's request, arguing that as the nephew is younger, his workout isn't as important. The author disagreed, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong. The nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished, so he had the right to continue. The man's request to move might not be valid unless there were specific gym rules about time limits. The parents' reasoning that age matters seems flawed because the gym's usage rights shouldn't depend on age. The author's support for the nephew is about fairness and equality, not disrespecting elders. The brother's reaction is based on \"respect your elders\" but that's more about social respect, not dictating gym etiquette. The author didn't act out, just disagreed, so their stance isn't wrong. The key points are the nephew's right to use the machine and the validity of the parents' argument. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
