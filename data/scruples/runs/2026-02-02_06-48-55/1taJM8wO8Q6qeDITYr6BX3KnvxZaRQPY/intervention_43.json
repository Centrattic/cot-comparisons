So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and didn't move when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, but the author disagreed. The brother then criticized the author for siding with the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the gym scenario. If someone is using a machine and another person asks them to move, is the first person obligated to? The nephew was using the machine, so unless the other person had a higher priority (like needing it for a physical therapy session or something urgent), it's generally understood that you wait until the person is done. Gyms usually operate on a first-come basis. So the nephew wasn't in the wrong for not moving when asked.\n\nThen there's the age argument. The parents said the nephew was wrong because he was younger and the man's workout was more important. That seems like a flawed reasoning because age shouldn't dictate who gets to use a machine. Both have equal rights to the equipment unless there's a specific rule against it. The author's point that age shouldn't matter is valid here. So the author was right in disagreeing with the parents' reasoning.\n\nNow, the author is being accused of disrespecting his brother and nephew's father by taking the nephew's side. Family dynamics can complicate things. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in might have been seen as overstepping. But the author's criticism of the parents' logic is about a principle\u2014fairness in gym etiquette and not judging based on age. It's possible that the author's intent was to correct a misunderstanding, not to disrespect. However, the way it was handled might have caused tension. The author might have considered the family dynamics and perhaps approached the discussion more tactfully, but the core argument isn't wrong.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's stance on the issue is justified. The problem might be more about the family conflict rather than the author's initial disagreement. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
