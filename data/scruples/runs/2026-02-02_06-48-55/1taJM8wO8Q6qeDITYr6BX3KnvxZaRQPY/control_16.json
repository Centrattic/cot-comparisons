So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when an older man asked. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong, but the author defended him, arguing that age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the conflict. The nephew was using a machine and the 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, saying he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning was that the nephew, being younger, should have yielded. The author disagrees, thinking that the importance of a workout isn't determined by age. \n\nIs the nephew in the wrong? In typical gym etiquette, when someone is using a machine, others generally wait their turn. However, the nephew was in the middle of his workout. If the machine is being used, it's expected to finish the session unless there's an urgent reason to interrupt. But the problem here is the nephew's refusal to move. Did the man have a valid reason? The scenario doesn't mention any urgency, so the nephew might have been within his rights to finish his set. However, in a public gym, there's an unspoken rule to be considerate of others. If someone is waiting and you're taking an unusually long time, it's polite to let them go. But the scenario doesn't specify how long he was on the machine. \n\nThe parents' argument is based on respect for elders. The nephew is 14, and the man is 30. The 30-year-old is an adult, so \"respect your elders\" is a cultural norm here. The nephew not moving could be seen as disrespecting the adult. But the author's point is that age shouldn't dictate whose workout is more important. The author is challenging the traditional hierarchy in this scenario. \n\nNow, the author defended the nephew in front of the family, which led to tension. The question is whether the author is wrong. Legally, there's no law here; it's about social norms. The parents' stance is about respecting elders, but the author's stance is about equal treatment. Both sides have valid points. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not have the authority to intervene. However, they did express their opinion, which could be seen as overstepping. But the user is asking if the author is at fault. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, the nephew probably should have let the man go, especially if the machine is a shared resource. However, if the nephew was just finishing a set and the man didn't have a time constraint, the nephew might not be in the wrong. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness, which is reasonable. The problem arises because the author publicly disagreed with the nephew's parents, which could be seen as disrespecting them. The author is in the wrong if the family values respecting elders more than individual rights in this context. But if the family values fairness and equality, the author isn't at fault. \n\nThe key factors are: the nephew's refusal to move without a clear reason, the cultural expectation of respecting elders, and the author's role as not the parent, leading to potential overstepping. The author might be at fault for not deferring to the parents' authority in their own household or the nephew's. However, the author's reasoning about age not determining importance is also valid. \n\nBut since the author is not the parent, perhaps they overstepped by publicly siding with the nephew. The parents might feel disrespected, especially if the author's girlfriend agreed with the parents initially but then the author contradicted them. The author's actions could have caused family tension, making them at fault in terms of family dynamics, even if their reasoning is sound. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they publicly disrespected their brother, even if the reasoning is debatable.\n"
