So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. So the situation is during a family dinner, the nephew had a conflict at the gym where a 30-year-old man asked him to move from a machine. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done, but his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger and the man's workout is more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and now the brother is upset because the author sided with the nephew and didn't respect the elders.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the right and wrong in the nephew's action. The nephew was using a gym machine, and someone asked him to move. The general etiquette at the gym is that people take turns, but it's usually based on availability, not age. If the machine was free when he started, he should be allowed to finish his set. The 30-year-old might have been waiting, but unless the nephew was taking an unusually long time, he isn't obligated to leave before he's done. So the nephew's action might not be wrong.\n\nThen the parents and girlfriend's reasoning. They said the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout is less important. That's a bit problematic because age shouldn't determine priority in a shared space. The author's argument makes sense here. The author is defending the nephew based on fairness and equality, which is reasonable. \n\nBut the author is also in a family dynamic. By disagreeing with their brother and his wife in front of them, the author might have come off as disrespectful, especially emphasizing the brother's view that \"respect your elders.\" Even if the author's reasoning is correct, the way they expressed it might have caused tension. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe they shouldn't have taken such a strong stance in the discussion.\n\nHowever, the core issue is about whether the nephew was in the wrong. The author's support might not be the issue; the problem could be the manner of the disagreement. The parents' reasoning was flawed, so aligning with the nephew on the principle of fairness is justifiable. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for supporting their nephew, but they might have mishandled the situation. \n\nConsidering the options, A means the author is wrong, B means they're not. The main question is about the nephew's action and the author's support. Since the parents' argument is based on an irrelevant factor (age), the author's stance is valid. But the family conflict part is also important. The author might have overstepped by not respecting the brother's position. However, the initial act of siding with the nephew isn't wrong if the parents' reasoning was incorrect. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
