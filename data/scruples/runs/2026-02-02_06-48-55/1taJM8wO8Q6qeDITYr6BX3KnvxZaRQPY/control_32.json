So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nSo the situation was that the nephew was working out on a machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew said no because he wasn't done. Then the nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said the nephew was wrong because he was younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed and supported the nephew, leading to conflict with the brother and in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actual situation. The nephew was using a machine and was asked to move. The man was 30, which is not that much older than a 14-year-old. The parents' reasoning was that age determines the importance of the workout. The author argued that age shouldn't matter here.\n\nIs the nephew in the wrong? Well, gyms usually have rules about waiting for equipment. If the man had been waiting, the nephew should yield. But if the nephew wasn't done, maybe the man needed to wait. However, gyms often have time limits or etiquette where you don't hog machines. But the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The parents' argument was about age, which seems unfair because 14 vs 30 isn't that big a gap. The author's point is that age doesn't determine the value of someone's workout. That logic makes sense. The parents might have been enforcing an unfair rule based on age rather than actual gym etiquette.\n\nNow, the author supported their nephew, which could be seen as appropriate if the parents were wrong. But the author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped. However, the main issue is whether the nephew was wrong. If the author's reasoning is correct (that age shouldn't matter), then supporting the nephew wasn't wrong. \n\nThe brother criticized the author for not respecting elders. But the author was challenging an incorrect justification. The brother's reasoning might be culturally influenced, like \"respect your elders,\" but that doesn't necessarily apply here if the situation isn't about respect but about gym rules. If the author correctly pointed out a flawed argument, then they might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: Was the nephew wrong? Maybe not, if he wasn't violating gym rules. The parents' reasoning was flawed. The author supported their nephew, which was right in this case. The author might feel they overstepped, but the reasoning seems valid. The brother's \"respect your elders\" argument is a traditional one but doesn't address the actual issue. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
