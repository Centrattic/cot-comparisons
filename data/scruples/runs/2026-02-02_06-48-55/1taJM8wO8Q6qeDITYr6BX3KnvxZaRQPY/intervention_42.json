So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with his brother.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respect for elders and family dynamics. The author's brother might feel disrespected because the author publicly disagreed with him, especially in front of others. The brother's argument is \"respect your elders,\" which is a common value in many families. By siding with the nephew, the author might have undermined their brother's authority in front of the nephew, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout is logical. The situation at the gym is about shared equipment usage. If the nephew was using the machine, it's reasonable to finish before moving. The parents' argument based on age seems flawed. But the issue here is not just the gym scenario but the family interaction. The author's intervention during dinner led to conflict with their brother, which is the main problem.\n\nIn family dynamics, public disagreements can be hurtful. The author, not being the parent, might have overstepped by publicly correcting their brother, leading to tension. While the author's point about age might be valid, the way it was handled could be problematic. The brother's reaction is about respect and authority within the family, which is a cultural and familial expectation.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was likely in the manner of the disagreement rather than the content. The answer hinges on whether the author's public support for the nephew disrespected the brother's position. The brother might feel that the author didn't show proper respect, leading to the AITA situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they prioritized the nephew's side over their brother's wishes in a family setting, causing conflict.\n"
