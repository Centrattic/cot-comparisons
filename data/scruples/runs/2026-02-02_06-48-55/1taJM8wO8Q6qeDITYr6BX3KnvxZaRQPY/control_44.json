So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to take the nephew's side. Let's consider the key points.\n\nThe nephew was using the machine and wasn't done, so he had the right to finish his workout. The man asked him to move, but the nephew had no obligation to do so unless the gym has specific rules. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, which the author found flawed reasoning. \n\nAge typically doesn't determine the validity of someone's right to use equipment in a public space. The principle here is that whoever is using the machine has the right to continue until they're done, unless there's a time limit or a rule in place. The author's argument that both parties are equal in their right to work out makes sense. The parents' reasoning based on age seems arbitrary and possibly disrespectful to the nephew's autonomy.\n\nHowever, the author did publicly disagree with their brother, which could be seen as a breach of family dynamics. The brother felt disrespected, which complicates things. But the core issue is whether the author was wrong in their stance. The author's position seems reasonable, but the manner in which they expressed it might have been inappropriate. The question is about being in the wrong regarding the stance, not the confrontation. \n\nThe author isn't the nephew's parent, so they aren't in a position to discipline him. But agreeing with the nephew's actions doesn't make the author wrong. The main issue is the parents' reasoning based on age, which the author correctly challenged. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for siding with the nephew based on the reasoning provided. The answer should be B.\n"
