So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend supported the man's request, arguing that the nephew, being younger, should yield. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym. The brother then confronts the author for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the key points are about gym etiquette and respect for elders. The author's stance is that both individuals have equal right to use the equipment regardless of age. The parents used \"respect your elders\" as the reason to side with the older man. \n\nI need to consider whether the author was wrong to challenge the parents' reasoning. The author's argument is about fairness based on equal rights to use the gym, not about age. The nephew was in the right to finish his workout, so the author supporting him makes sense. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, which could be seen as disrespectful in a family context. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the nephew was wrong. The parents' reasoning seems flawed because gym etiquette typically prioritizes who is currently using the equipment. So the nephew did nothing wrong. The author's support is justified. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate, especially in front of the brother. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author correctly supported the nephew's right to use the machine and challenged the parents' age-based reasoning, they are in the right. The parents' argument is invalid, so the author isn't wrong for opposing it. The potential issue is the manner of the disagreement, but the content of the argument is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
