So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym, using a machine. A 30-year-old man asked him to move, which the nephew declined because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said the nephew was wrong, arguing that he's younger and thus should prioritize the older man's workout. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context. This led to some family tension, with the brother criticizing the author for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to support the nephew. Let me break it down.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, sometimes people suggest younger individuals should yield to older ones, especially in shared spaces. However, that's not a universal rule. The key here is whether the nephew was being respectful and within his rights. If the man asked the nephew to move, the nephew's right to finish his workout depends on gym rules. If the machine wasn't time-limited and the nephew was using it, he wasn't obligated to leave. So the nephew's action might have been justified.\n\nThe parents' reasoning based on age as a factor for importance seems flawed. Age doesn't inherently make one person's workout more important. The author's argument that both parties were equally entitled to their workout is valid. However, the author's decision to openly disagree during the dinner might have been inappropriate, especially since they're not the nephew's parent. It's possible that the author overstepped by challenging the brother's authority in front of others, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, standing up against what one perceives as unfair treatment based on age could be seen as supporting fairness. The author might have been trying to model critical thinking for the nephew. But the method of confrontation in a family setting might have been tactless.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the nephew was within his rights and the parents' reasoning was incorrect, the author's support is justified. However, the manner in which the author expressed their disagreement might have been problematic, leading to conflict. The author might be in the right in the argument's content but in the wrong in how they handled the family dynamics.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's reasoning about the fairness of the situation is valid. However, the way they expressed it could be seen as A (wrong) due to family dynamics. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding siding with the nephew, not the method. Since the author's stance on the issue is correct, the answer would be B.\n"
