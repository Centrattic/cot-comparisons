So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he was younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nIn terms of social norms, the gym is a public space where people generally follow the rule of using equipment as they come to it. If someone is using a machine, others wait their turn. However, the nephew was in the middle of his workout, so interrupting him might not be fair. The parents and girlfriend's reasoning that age matters seems flawed because age doesn't inherently affect the right to use equipment. The author's defense of the nephew's right to finish his set makes sense logically, but the author's brother felt disrespected, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are the social rules of the gym and the family dynamics. The author isn't the parent, so stepping in to defend the nephew might be seen as overstepping, but the reasoning was about fairness rather than age. However, the brother might feel the author undermined his authority. \n\nBut the author's argument is based on correct gym etiquette\u2014using equipment as you're able without letting age dictate priority. So while the family conflict is unfortunate, the author's stance seems justified. Thus, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
