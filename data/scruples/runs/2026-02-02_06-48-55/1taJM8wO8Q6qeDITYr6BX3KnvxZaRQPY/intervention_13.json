So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where a nephew had a conflict at the gym. The nephew didn't move from a machine when asked by a 30-year-old, and his parents and girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author sides with the nephew, thinking age shouldn't matter, which led to tension with the brother and brother-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the nephew's right to use the machine until done versus the other person's request. The author argues that age isn't a factor in who should move. Gym etiquette usually says if someone is using a machine, others should wait until they're done. So the nephew wasn't wrong. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed because the importance of a workout isn't determined by age. The author siding with the nephew is supporting a valid point. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, causing family tension. But the core issue is about the nephew's right to not move. So, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew. The answer would be B.\n"
