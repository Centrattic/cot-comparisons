So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here. Then, after dinner, the brother (nephew's father) got upset with the author for not respecting him by disagreeing in front of others.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author was wrong to side with the nephew. The author's argument is that the nephew had the right to finish his workout regardless of the man's age. The parents' reasoning was based on age, suggesting older people's needs take precedence. The author thinks that's unfair since both workouts are equally important.\n\nLegally, in many places, there's no rule that younger people must yield to older ones on gym equipment. It's usually first-come, first-served unless there's a specific policy. So the nephew wasn't wrong for continuing his set. The parents might be applying an outdated social norm that younger people should yield to older ones, which isn't universally accepted. The author supporting the nephew's right to finish seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the social aspect is also important. The author's brother felt disrespected because the author publicly disagreed. In family dynamics, maintaining harmony is crucial. The author might have overstepped by not letting the brother handle his son's discipline. But the author's stance was based on fairness, which is valid.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew, especially since the nephew had the right to use the machine. The parents' reasoning was flawed. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have been tactless, leading to tension. But the answer hinges on whether the core action (supporting the nephew) is wrong. Given that, the answer is B (No).\n"
