So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The nephew was at the gym, using a machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and got into a conflict with the brother over \"respecting elders.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are about respect for elders versus the actual situation at the gym. The author's stance is that the nephew was right to stay until he finished, regardless of age. The brother argues it's about respecting elders, which is a cultural norm in many societies.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the nephew's right to use the machine until done isn't dependent on age. Gym etiquette usually dictates that someone using equipment can stay until they're finished. The brother's reasoning that a younger person's workout is less important is flawed. Age doesn't determine the validity of one's workout. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness and equality, which makes sense. However, in a family setting, the author might have overstepped by disagreeing with their brother in front of others, but the substance of their argument is valid.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of the actual situation. The problem isn't the author's opinion but the family dynamics. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
