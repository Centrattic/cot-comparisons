So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger, but the author sides with the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't matter in that situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong. The nephew was using a machine, and the older man asked him to move. The nephew didn't have to move just because the man asked; typically, in a gym, you use the equipment until you're done. The parents' reasoning was that the nephew was younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, which makes sense because age shouldn't determine who gets to use the machine first.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author publicly disagreed with their brother and brother-in-law, which might have caused tension. The question is whether the author was right to side with the nephew despite not being the parent. The user's brother felt disrespected, so the author might have overstepped by correcting them in front of others. However, the author's point about age not being a factor is valid. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's common to let others use machines when they're done, but the nephew didn't interrupt his workout. The parents' reasoning is flawed. However, the author's approach in a family setting might have been poor. The key is whether the author was in the wrong for their stance. Since the nephew's action was reasonable and the parents' argument was based on an invalid premise, the author's disagreement isn't wrong. But the way they expressed it might have been tactless. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not the method. So the answer would be B (No), because the author's reasoning is correct, even if the manner could have been improved.\n"
