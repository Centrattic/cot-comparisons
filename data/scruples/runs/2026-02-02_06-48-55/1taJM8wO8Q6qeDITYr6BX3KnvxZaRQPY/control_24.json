So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette. The nephew was told by an older man to move from a machine, and he refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the older man, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger. The author disagrees, thinking the nephew was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are about gym etiquette, respect for elders, and the validity of the parents' reasoning. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked by someone else. The parents argue that the nephew should yield because the other person is older, implying their workout is more important. The author thinks age shouldn't matter here.\n\nLegally and ethically, in most gyms, there's an unspoken rule about not hogging equipment. If someone is done with a machine, others should use it. But if the nephew was still working out, refusing to move isn't necessarily wrong. However, gym etiquette often involves being considerate. So if the machine is in use, others usually wait. But if the nephew was clearly using it and hadn't finished, the other person's request might be premature.\n\nThe parents' reasoning based on age is questionable. Age doesn't inherently make someone's needs more important. The author is right that both parties have equal rights to the gym facilities. The nephew didn't do anything wrong by staying on the machine until done, regardless of the other person's age.\n\nBut the author sided with the nephew in front of the family, which led to conflict. The brother felt disrespected because the author contradicted him, and the author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe they shouldn't have taken that side. However, the author's reasoning is valid. The issue here is more about the validity of the parents' argument rather than the author's support.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for supporting the nephew. The author's argument is sound, but in a family setting, the way they expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate. However, the moral stance here is on the author's side. The parents' use of age as a justification is flawed. So the author isn't wrong for disagreeing with their logic. The problem is more about the family dynamics and the parents' reasoning, not the author's support for the nephew.\n"
