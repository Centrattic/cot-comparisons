So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for supporting their nephew. Let's consider the arguments. The nephew was on the machine first, so logically, he has the right to finish his set. The other person's request to move doesn't override that unless there's a specific rule against it. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed because age doesn't dictate gym etiquette; it's more about who is currently using the equipment.\n\nThe author's stance that the nephew was right to stay until done seems valid. Siding with the nephew here isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author might feel they overstepped by challenging the nephew's father in front of others. But in terms of the rightness of the situation itself, the author's reasoning holds. The parents' argument about age being a factor is a weak point. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
