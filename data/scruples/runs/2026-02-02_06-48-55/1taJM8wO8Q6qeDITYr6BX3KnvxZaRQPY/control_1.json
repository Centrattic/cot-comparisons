So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner.\n\nThe situation involves a 14-year-old nephew who was using a gym machine and didn't move when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age wasn't a factor here.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using the machine and wasn't done. The man asked him to move, but the nephew didn't. The parents are upset because the nephew didn't yield to the older man. The author defended the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nLegally or logically, when someone is using a machine, others typically wait their turn. However, the nephew wasn't finished, so he wasn't obligated to move immediately. The parents' reasoning is flawed because age doesn't determine workout importance, as the author pointed out. The man is 30, not exactly an elder, but maybe the parents meant \"younger vs. older\" in a different sense.\n\nThe conflict here is about respect for elders. The author's brother accused them of disrespecting him by siding with the nephew. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might have overstepped, but the parents' argument was based on age, which the author correctly challenged.\n\nThe key points: The nephew's right to finish his workout vs. the older man's request. The parents' stance is about respect for elders, but the author argues that the situation isn't about age. The author's defense is reasonable because the nephew's use of the machine isn't dependent on age. The author isn't in the wrong for supporting a valid point against the flawed reasoning of the parents and girlfriend.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
