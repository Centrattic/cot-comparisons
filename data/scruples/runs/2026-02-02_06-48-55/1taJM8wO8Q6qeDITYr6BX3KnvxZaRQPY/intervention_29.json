So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, citing respect for elders. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't determine who moves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The nephew was using a machine and hadn't finished his workout. The older man asked him to move, and the nephew declined. The parents' reasoning was based on the idea that respect for elders is important. The author sides with the nephew, thinking age shouldn't matter in this situation.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and gym etiquette. In many gyms, there's an unspoken rule where younger people might yield to older individuals, especially if they're using the same equipment and the older person is waiting. However, the nephew wasn't done, so he might not be obligated to move. On the other hand, the parents' emphasis on respecting elders could be a cultural or family value.\n\nThe author's stance is that the parents are wrong to prioritize age over the situation. The author's argument is that both individuals were there to work out, so neither's workout is inherently more important. The nephew's parents might feel that teaching respect for elders is important, even if the situation is a minor one.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The author's actions led to a conflict with their brother, who felt disrespected. The author might have overstepped by not letting the parents correct their own child, especially in front of others. However, the author's point about fairness and not judging based on age is valid in a public setting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the family values respecting elders and the author's public disagreement undermined that, then maybe A. But if the author was right to stand by the nephew's right to finish his workout regardless of age, then B. The situation is nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to use the machine, but they might have handled it poorly by publicly disagreeing with the nephew's parents. However, the core issue is about whether age should dictate gym etiquette. The author's reasoning seems justifiable, but the way they expressed it might have been inconsiderate. Still, the main question is about being in the wrong for the stance, not the manner. So the answer might lean towards B.\n"
