So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by someone older, and the nephew refusing. The parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the parents' reasoning that age should matter, while the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the conflict. The nephew was using a gym machine and the older man asked him to move. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't factor into the importance of a workout.\n\nThe author's stance was that both people's workouts are equally valid regardless of age. That seems fair. The parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument, which could be a cultural norm, but the author challenges that by pointing out that age doesn't determine the value of one's workout. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The author isn't the parent, so they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother. However, the reasoning about the situation being about equality in the gym seems valid. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The nephew was in the right to not move until done.\n2. The parents used an age-based justification which the author correctly challenged.\n3. The author's intervention might have caused family tension, but their reasoning is sound.\n\nSo, while the author might have caused some family friction by not letting their brother's opinion stand, the actual issue of the nephew's right to use the machine is on the author's side. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But I need to check if there's a cultural context where respecting elders is a strict norm, which might make the author's stance seem disrespectful. However, the scenario is about a gym setting where fairness and turn-taking are more relevant than age. So, the author's reasoning is logical. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
