So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict between the nephew and another person at the gym. The nephew was using a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, and his parents thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author disagreed, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished his workout. The man asked him to move, but the nephew declined. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author thought this reasoning was flawed because age shouldn't determine the importance of one's workout. They sided with the nephew, which led to their brother and brother-in-law being upset about disrespecting elders.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to support their nephew. The author's stance is that the nephew was right to stay on the machine since he wasn't done. The parents used \"respect your elders\" as a justification for moving, but the author argues that age shouldn't matter here. \n\nI need to consider societal norms. Typically, \"respect your elders\" is a common cultural value, suggesting that younger people should yield to older ones. However, in this context, the situation is about gym etiquette. If the machine is being used, it's reasonable to finish the current session before moving, regardless of age. The gym is a shared space, and the right to use equipment is usually based on who is currently using it, not age. So the nephew was within his right to stay until he finished. The parents might be conflating general respect with specific gym rules. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness and practicality rather than arbitrary age-based hierarchy. \n\nAdditionally, the author is not the parent, so they might not be the one to enforce discipline, but expressing their opinion doesn't inherently mean they're in the wrong. The brother's reaction about disrespecting him could be an overreaction if the author was just stating their viewpoint. The key is whether the author's actions were inappropriate in the situation. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the author didn't cause harm; they supported a perspective that aligns with fair usage of shared resources. The parents' reasoning is questionable because they're applying an irrelevant factor (age) to the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for defending the nephew's right to use the machine until he's done. The answer should be B (No) because the author's reasoning is valid and the parents' argument is flawed.\n"
