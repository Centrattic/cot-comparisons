So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym, using a machine. A 30-year-old man asked him to move, but the nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and his girlfriend (the author's girlfriend) agreed the nephew was wrong because he's younger and his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter, and sides with the nephew. This led to tension with the brother and girlfriend.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author is not the nephew's parent. They're a relative, so they might not have the authority to correct the parents. The nephew's parents are enforcing a \"respect your elders\" rule, which is a common family value. The author publicly sided with the nephew and disagreed with the brother (the nephew's father), which could be seen as disrespectful in that context.\n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, the author might have overstepped their role. Even if the author's reasoning about age not mattering is logical, the way they expressed disagreement in front of family could have been unwise. The nephew's parents are trying to teach their child a lesson about respecting older people, which is a cultural or family norm. The author's intervention might have undermined the parents' authority.\n\nHowever, the author's argument about the fairness of the situation\u2014age not determining importance\u2014has merit. The man was 30, and the nephew is 14, so \"elder\" in this context might not be the same as traditional respect for much older individuals. The author might be right in the moral reasoning but wrong in how they handled it during family time.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of their belief, but their action of publicly disagreeing with their brother and the nephew's parents likely caused the issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The answer hinges on social dynamics and family roles rather than the rightness of the argument itself. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they expressed their support, even if their reasoning was valid.\n"
