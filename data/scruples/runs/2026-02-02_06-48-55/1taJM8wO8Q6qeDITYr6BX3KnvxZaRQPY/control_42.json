So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's nephew was at the dinner, and the nephew had an argument with a 30-year-old man at the gym about using a machine. The nephew didn't move when asked, and the parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't matter since both were working out for their own health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, and someone asked him to move. The nephew didn't want to stop because he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning is that the man is older, so his workout is more important. The author thinks that's unfair, as age doesn't determine importance. \n\nNow, the question is whether the nephew was wrong. If the gym has a rule where if someone is waiting, you should move when asked, then the nephew might be wrong. But if there's no such rule, then maybe he was right to stay until he's done. However, the author didn't mention if there were any specific gym rules or if the man had a claim to the machine. \n\nThen, the author sided with the nephew, which led to conflict with their brother (the nephew's father) and the girlfriend. The brother felt disrespected because he's the father, and the author isn't the nephew's parent. The key points here are about respecting elders and family dynamics. \n\nIn terms of the nephew's actions, maybe the author is right that age shouldn't be a factor in gym etiquette. But in many gyms, people do expect to take turns, and being rude to someone who's waiting could be an issue. However, if the nephew was in the middle of his set and the man just asked him to move without waiting, the nephew's response might be justified. The problem is that the parents and girlfriend thought the nephew should give in because he's younger. \n\nThe author's part in the situation is that they publicly disagreed with their brother and girlfriend. The brother might see this as the author not respecting him as a parent. But the author's reasoning is about fairness based on age. So, is the author wrong for standing by their opinion? It's hard to say. They might have been right in supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout but could have handled the disagreement more diplomatically to avoid disrespecting their brother. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The author's stance is about the validity of the parents' reasoning, which was based on age. If the author's argument is that the nephew was correct in not moving until he's done, then maybe the author is right. However, the author's comment might have come off as challenging their brother's parenting in front of others, which could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the nephew's action was wrong and how the author expressed their support. If the nephew was right to stay, then the author isn't wrong. If the nephew was in the wrong, then the author might be. But without more context about gym rules, it's a bit tricky. However, the parents' reasoning was flawed because age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. So, the author's disagreement with that logic is valid. \n\nBut the author also doesn't want to disrespect their brother. So maybe the author is in the right for the reasoning but could have approached it more tactfully. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the focus is on the author's actions in the family argument. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their stance, but they might have mishandled the conflict. Since the answer options are between A (yes) and B (no), and the core issue is the nephew's right to use the machine, the author's reasoning seems valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
