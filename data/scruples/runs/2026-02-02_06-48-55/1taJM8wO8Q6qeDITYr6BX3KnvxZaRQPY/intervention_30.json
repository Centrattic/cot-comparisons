So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement between the nephew and an older man at the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The nephew was using a machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that the man is older, so his workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up siding with the nephew. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was wrong to support the nephew. The nephew's parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument. In many cultures, showing respect to older individuals is valued, so maybe the author's brother sees the nephew's refusal as disrespectful. However, the author's point is that both people have equal rights to use the gym equipment, regardless of age. So there's a conflict between respecting elders and equal treatment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the gym has a policy where people can be asked to move, maybe the nephew should have moved. But if the man just asked and there was no policy, the nephew had the right to finish. The author's disagreement isn't about the nephew's actions per se, but the parents' reasoning based on age. The author's support might be seen as challenging the brother's authority, which could be why the brother was upset.\n\nThe author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in might be overstepping. However, the author's argument about age not determining importance is valid. The brother might feel disrespected, but the author's intent was to support a point about fairness. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the issue is about challenging the brother's parenting in front of others, maybe A (yes). But if it's about the validity of the argument, maybe B (no). The user's own thought is A, but I need to decide based on the situation. The author's disagreement with the parents' reasoning isn't wrong, but the way they expressed it might have been. The main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Since the author's stance is based on fairness and equal treatment, which is reasonable, but the way they stood up to the brother might have been inappropriate. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about social etiquette. So the answer might be B (no), because the author's reasoning isn't inherently wrong, even if the situation caused family tension.\n"
