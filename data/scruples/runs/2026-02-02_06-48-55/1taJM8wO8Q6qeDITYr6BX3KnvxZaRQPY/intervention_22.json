So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where a 14-year-old nephew was told he was wrong for not moving from a gym machine by his parents and the author's girlfriend. The author sides with the nephew, arguing that age doesn't determine workout importance. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, the nephew's actions: He was using the machine and refused to move when asked by a 30-year-old. His parents said he was wrong because he was younger, but the author thinks that's invalid. The key point here is whether the nephew had a right to stay on the machine until he finished. In a public gym, typically, people take turns, but the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The man asked him to move, but the nephew hadn't finished. The parents' reasoning that age matters seems flawed because the nephew's workout isn't less important just because he's younger. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness and equal treatment, which makes sense.\n\nHowever, the author's conflict with the brother comes from siding in front of his nephew. The brother might feel disrespected, and the author isn't the parent, so maybe they overstepped. But the issue is more about the principle of fairness versus traditional respect for elders. The author's stance on the situation could be correct, but the way they expressed it might have caused rifts. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for the content of their argument or the manner.\n\nIn terms of the gym situation, the author's reasoning is valid. Age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. However, in the family dynamics, the author might have been in the right by standing up for fairness, but their brother's reaction about respecting elders is a cultural or family norm debate. The author's mistake might be in how they intervened, not the actual stance. But the core question is whether the author was wrong in their support. Since the parents' reasoning was flawed, the author's support isn't wrong. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
