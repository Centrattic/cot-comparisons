So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette. \n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and a 30-year-old man asked him to move from a machine. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with the brother.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect. The author's argument is that both parties have equal right to use the gym equipment, regardless of age. The nephew was using the machine, so it's reasonable he didn't move immediately. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed because age doesn't inherently determine the value of someone's workout. \n\nBut the author's actions\u2014publicly disagreeing with their brother and the nephew's father\u2014could be seen as undermining family authority. The brother felt disrespected, which adds a layer of family dynamics. While the author's stance on the issue might be correct, challenging a sibling in front of others can create tension. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not have the right to correct the father's parenting decisions directly in that setting.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning about age not determining importance is valid. The real issue might be the public confrontation rather than the content of the argument. So, the author's position on the gym issue isn't wrong, but the way they handled it could be problematic in terms of family relations. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the method. Since the author's stance on the gym issue is correct, but their intervention might have caused family discord, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the core of the question is about siding with the nephew, which the author did based on a fair argument. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But if the problem is the public disagreement with the brother, then maybe A. Hmm. Need to decide if the author is in the wrong for their stance or the confrontation.\n"
