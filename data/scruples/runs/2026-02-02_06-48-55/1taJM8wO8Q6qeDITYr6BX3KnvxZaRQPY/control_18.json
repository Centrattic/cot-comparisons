So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict between the nephew and another person at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in that context.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they argue that both the nephew and the man were working out for their health, so neither's workout is more important based on age. The parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument, which the author found flawed. The author then publicly disagreed with their brother, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the nephew was on the machine first, so he had the right to finish. The parents' reasoning based on age seems unfair. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness and equal treatment, which is valid. However, the author is not the parent, so maybe they overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, causing conflict. The key points are whether the nephew was in the wrong and if the author's intervention was appropriate.\n\nThe nephew wasn't wrong in refusing to move since he was using the machine. The parents' argument is invalid because age doesn't determine priority in gym usage. The author's stance is correct regarding the nephew's actions. However, the way they expressed disagreement might have been disrespectful. The author's fault might be in the manner, not the opinion. But the question is if they're in the wrong for their position. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the nephew was correct in staying, and the author's reasoning is sound. The conflict arises from how they expressed it, not the content of their argument.\n"
