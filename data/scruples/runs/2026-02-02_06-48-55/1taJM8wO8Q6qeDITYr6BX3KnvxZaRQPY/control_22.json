So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, the scenario involves the nephew being asked to move from a machine by a 30-year-old. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend criticized him, saying he should have moved because the man was older. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't determine gym etiquette and stood up for the nephew. After dinner, the author's brother (the nephew's father) was upset and told the author they were wrong for not respecting elders.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault here. So, is the author wrong for supporting the nephew? Let's think about the key points. \n\nThe nephew was using the machine and wasn't finished. The other person asked him to move. The nephew's parents argued that because the man was older, his workout was more important. The author thinks this is wrong and that both should be equal regardless of age.\n\nGym etiquette typically suggests that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. If the nephew was still using it, he shouldn't have to move. So the nephew's action of not moving wasn't wrong. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed. Age doesn't inherently make someone's workout more important. The author's support for the nephew is valid because they're upholding the principle that everyone should have equal access to gym equipment regardless of age.\n\nHowever, the author is not the nephew's parent, so stepping in to argue against the nephew's father could be seen as overstepping. The brother was upset because the author didn't respect his authority. But the author's argument is about correctness, not authority. The brother's emphasis on \"respecting elders\" is a cultural norm, but the author's stance is about fairness and equal treatment.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't wrong for supporting the nephew when the parents' reasoning is based on an arbitrary factor like age. The author's disagreement is a matter of differing viewpoints. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't at fault for standing by their belief in equal treatment and correcting a flawed argument, even if it caused tension with the brother.\n"
