So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with his brother over the \"respect your elders\" argument.\n\nSo, the main points are about respect for elders versus fairness in gym etiquette. The author's brother and girlfriend believe that older people should be prioritized because their workout is more important. The author argues that age doesn't determine the value of a workout and that both parties have equal right to use the machine.\n\nNow, considering social norms in gyms, typically, if someone is using a machine and another person is waiting, the user is expected to finish their set before others can take the machine. However, the brother's argument is based on age, which the author correctly points out is irrelevant. The nephew did the right thing by not moving until he was done. The parents and girlfriend's reasoning is flawed because age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. \n\nThe author's main mistake might be getting into the argument publicly, which could have been a family dynamic issue. However, the content of their argument is valid. The core issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong, which he wasn't. So the author supporting him is justified. The brother's argument about respecting elders is a common cultural norm but doesn't apply here because the situation isn't about respect but about gym rules and fairness. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their nephew's correct action. The brother's reasoning is flawed. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
