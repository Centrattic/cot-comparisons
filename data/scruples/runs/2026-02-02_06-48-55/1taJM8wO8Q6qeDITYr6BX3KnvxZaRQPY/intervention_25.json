So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when asked by a 30-year-old man. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, but the author supports the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the main points of contention. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked. His parents are saying he should have because the man is older. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nThe key here is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. Typically, in gyms, there are etiquette rules. If someone is using a machine and another person is waiting, it's customary to switch turns. However, the situation here is that the man asked the nephew to move, but the nephew didn't. The parents are using the age argument, which might not be valid. Age alone doesn't determine who should yield in such a scenario. The more important factors are whether the machine was being used efficiently and if there's an unspoken rule in the gym to take turns. \n\nThe author siding with the nephew is about the principle that age doesn't dictate the importance of a workout. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the nephew's father, especially since they are not the parent. The conflict arises from the author's public support of the nephew, which led to tension with the brother. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions were based on a valid principle (age not being a factor), then maybe not. But the issue is the public disagreement and the impact on family dynamics. However, the core issue is the nephew's actions. If the nephew was wrong, the author is in the wrong for supporting him. But if the nephew was right, the author is justified. \n\nIn gyms, people usually wait their turn. If the nephew was using the machine and the man asked to switch, not moving could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the nephew wasn't done, he might be within his right to finish. But the parents' reasoning based on age is flawed. The author is correct in that age shouldn't matter, but the actual etiquette might require taking turns. \n\nSo, the author's support for the nephew might be misplaced if the nephew was technically in the wrong by not yielding. But if the nephew was justifiably using the machine and the man's request was unwarranted, then the author is right. However, the author's public disagreement might have been inappropriate regardless. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance in the situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's reasoning is sound regarding age not mattering, and the gym situation's specifics can be context-dependent. However, the public support could be seen as a family dynamic issue, but the core question is about the principle. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for their stance, even if the family dynamics are strained.\n"
