So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict between the nephew and another person at the gym.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and someone older asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout is less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nSo, the main points are: the nephew was in his right to use the machine until done unless there's a rule against it. The parents' argument based on age seems flawed because everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age. The author supported the nephew, which the brother took as disrespect.\n\nLegally or ethically, in a gym setting, if there's no time limit on machines, the user has the right to finish. The brother's reasoning that younger people should yield to older ones isn't a standard rule; gyms usually prioritize who's currently using the equipment. The author's stance was correct in supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout. However, the author might have been inconsiderate by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which could cause family tension. But the issue of siding with the nephew isn't wrong. The brother's reaction seems more about authority and respect than the actual situation. So the author isn't in the wrong for defending the right principle, even if the manner might have caused some family issues.\n"
