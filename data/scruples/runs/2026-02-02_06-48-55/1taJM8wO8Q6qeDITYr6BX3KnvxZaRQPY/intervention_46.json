So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the nephew was at the gym and another person asked him to move from a machine. He refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine priority. Then the brother (the nephew's father) got upset, saying something about respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The nephew was using a machine and was asked to move by someone older. He didn't move. The parents and girlfriend criticized him for not yielding to the older person because of age. The author defended the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't matter. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the nephew was wrong to refuse moving. Gym etiquette typically involves using equipment until you're done, unless someone needs to switch to another machine. If the machine is free, you can use it. If someone needs it, maybe the courtesy is to let them go. But there's no strict rule about age here. So the nephew's action might be seen as reasonable if he was still using the machine.\n\nThe parents' reasoning that younger people should yield to older ones is a bit questionable. It's a traditional view, but not necessarily a universal rule. The author's defense of the nephew based on equality in wanting to work out makes sense. However, the author stepped into the nephew's family dynamics, which could be seen as overstepping. The brother might feel that the author is not his parent and shouldn't be contradicting him in front of the family.\n\nSo the author's mistake might be not just in the opinion but in how they expressed it. Arguing in front of the family and disagreeing with the nephew's father could have caused tension. The brother felt disrespected, which is a valid feeling in family settings. The author's intent was to support the nephew, but the method might have been inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong if they believe in standing up for what's fair. However, in family matters, especially with parents, it's often better to avoid public confrontation unless necessary. The question is whether the author crossed a line by publicly disagreeing and causing conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their reasoning makes sense. The brother's reaction is about respect, which is important in family hierarchies. The author, not being the nephew's parent, shouldn't have taken a strong stance in front of the family, leading to disrespect towards the brother.\n"
