So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation involves the author's brother and sister-in-law giving their 14-year-old nephew feedback for not moving off a gym machine when an older man asked. The nephew was using the machine and wasn't done, so he refused. The author disagreed with the parents' reasoning that the nephew should yield because the man was older, not because he was done. The author's girlfriend sided with the parents, and the brother was upset the author didn't support their stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are teaching their kids about respect for elders, which is a common cultural value. The nephew was in a public place (the gym) and the older man might have been waiting, so the parents might want their son to be polite. The nephew's action could be seen as rude, but he wasn't finished. The author's argument is that age shouldn't matter in such a situation, as both people are there for their health. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The parents are the authority here, so the author stepping in could be seen as undermining them. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not have the right to correct the parents publicly. However, the author's reasoning might be valid\u2014age shouldn't determine gym etiquette. But the issue is the conflict within the family and the author's role in it. \n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, the author might have overstepped by taking the nephew's side against the parents. It's possible the brother felt disrespected. Even if the author's point is logically sound, the way they intervened could have caused tension. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family's expectations. But since the parents were trying to teach a lesson, the author's interference could be seen as wrong. So the answer is likely A.\n"
