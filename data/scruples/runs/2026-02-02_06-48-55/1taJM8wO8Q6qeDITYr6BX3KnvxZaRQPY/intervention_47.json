So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym with a 30-year-old man. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when the man asked. The nephew's parents and girlfriend side with the man, saying the nephew was wrong because he's younger and thus his workout isn't as important. The author sides with the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't determine who moves. The brother then confronts the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: was the nephew wrong to not move? At the gym, if someone is using a machine, it's generally expected that others wait until they're done unless there's a specific reason to interrupt, like urgency or shared time slots. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, so refusing to move immediately isn't necessarily wrong. The man's request might be based on impatience, but that doesn't make the nephew's refusal incorrect. \n\nThe parents' reasoning that age makes the man's workout more important is a bit flawed. The author's point that both are working out for their health and that age doesn't determine priority seems valid. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe they shouldn't have intervened, but they were defending the nephew's actions. However, by publicly disagreeing with the brother and his wife, the author might have caused family tension. \n\nThe author's brother feels disrespected, which could be a valid concern. Even if the author's argument is logical, the way they expressed disagreement might have been inappropriate. The key question is whether siding with the nephew in this context (during family time) was wrong. The author might not be in the wrong for their belief, but perhaps in how they handled the situation, leading to disrespecting the brother. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the nephew's actions were justified, the author's support was reasonable, but the conflict arose from family dynamics. The author isn't the one who physically did something wrong, but maybe in the context of family relations, they overstepped by publicly disagreeing. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong regarding their stance. If the answer hinges on whether their opinion is valid, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the issue is about family respect, then perhaps they are. I'm a bit torn but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's reasoning seems correct, even if the situation created tension.\n"
