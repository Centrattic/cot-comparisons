So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nThe situation is that the nephew was using a gym machine and another person asked him to move. The nephew didn't move immediately, and his parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't factor into whose workout is more important. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The nephew was using a machine and the other person asked him to move. The nephew wasn't done, so refusing makes sense. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author thinks is flawed. The author's stance is that both have equal right to the machine regardless of age.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the nephew was following his workout schedule, so he had the right to finish. The other person could have asked politely or waited, but the nephew wasn't obligated to move immediately. The parents' emphasis on age seems like an inappropriate factor here. The author supporting the nephew is standing by a logical point rather than a disrespectful one.\n\nThe author's brother criticized them for not respecting elders. However, in this case, the situation is about gym etiquette and fairness, not about showing respect through deference. The author's disagreement was based on the premise that age doesn't determine the validity of the situation, which is a reasonable argument. \n\nThe key here is whether supporting the nephew was a breach of family respect. The author did challenge their brother's viewpoint, but the conflict arose from a misunderstanding of the situation. The author's intent was to correct a flawed reasoning based on age, not to disrespect their brother. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for defending a fair point. The brother's parents' reasoning was based on an irrelevant factor (age), so the author's stance was justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
