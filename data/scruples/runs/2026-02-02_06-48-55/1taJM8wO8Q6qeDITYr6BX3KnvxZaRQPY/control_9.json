So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking it was unfair to prioritize based on age.\n\nThe main points of contention are the parents' reasoning. They used \"respect your elders\" as a justification. The author argues that age shouldn't determine priority at the gym, and both people had equal rights to use the equipment. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the author's side seems reasonable. Gym etiquette typically follows rules like \"first come, first served\" and \"finish your set before others can use the machine.\" Age isn't a standard factor here. The parents' argument based on age is a bit outdated or overly traditional. \n\nHowever, the author's defense of their nephew in front of their brother might have come off as disrespectful, especially if the brother felt his parenting was being challenged. Family dynamics can be tricky here. The author isn't the parent, so stepping in might have crossed a line, depending on the context. But the reasoning itself is sound. \n\nThe key is whether the author was wrong in their stance, not the manner. The stance is based on fairness and equality, which are valid. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about the parents' reasoning than the author's position. The author's mistake might be in how they expressed it, but the question is about being in the wrong regarding the situation, not the manner of expression. \n\nSo, the conclusion is B. The author isn't wrong for advocating for their nephew based on the reasoning provided.\n"
