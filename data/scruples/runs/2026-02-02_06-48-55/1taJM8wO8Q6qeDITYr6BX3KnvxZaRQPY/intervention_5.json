So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the scenario) is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, leading his parents and the author's girlfriend to side with the man, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he was younger. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine workout priority. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong).\n\nSo, I need to evaluate who was right in the gym situation and whether the author was wrong in supporting their nephew. \n\nLooking at the gym scenario: Typically, when someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. If the machine is in use, it's polite to ask, but the person using it isn't obligated to move until they're done. The nephew didn't do anything wrong by refusing to move when he wasn't finished. His parents' reasoning that the older man's workout was more important because of age seems flawed. Age doesn't inherently make one's workout more important than another's. The author's support of the nephew makes sense here because the nephew was in the right.\n\nThen there's the family conflict. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they weren't supposed to discipline him. But the author was standing up for their nephew against the parents and girlfriend. The brother felt disrespected. However, the author didn't overstep necessarily; they were expressing their opinion. The brother's response of \"respect your elders\" is a cultural value, but it doesn't justify the parents' incorrect reasoning. The author's disagreement was valid.\n\nSo, in the gym situation, the nephew was right, the parents were wrong to side with the older man based on age. The author correctly supported the nephew. The brother's reaction is about family dynamics, but the author wasn't wrong in their stance. Therefore, the answer is B (the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
