So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family discussion about the gym incident.\n\nFirst, the nephew was told to move off a machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, arguing that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. The brother then criticizes the author for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's stance on age determining importance, the family dynamics, and whether the author overstepped by taking the nephew's side.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nLegally or ethically, when someone is using a gym machine, they have the right to continue until they're done. The man asking the nephew to move might not have been in the right either. But the parents argued that the nephew should yield because he's younger, which the author finds unfair. The author's reasoning is that age doesn't matter in this context, which seems logical. However, the author is getting into a conflict with their brother and girlfriend, which is a family matter.\n\nThe author isn't the nephew's parent, so perhaps they shouldn't have intervened as much as they did. But the situation is about the gym incident, not about the nephew's behavior beyond that. The author's disagreement with the parents' reasoning might be valid, but the way they expressed it might have caused conflict. However, the core issue is about the right to use the machine. The author's stance is that the nephew was right to stay until he was done, which aligns with common gym etiquette. So the author's position isn't wrong in that aspect. The problem arises in the family dynamics\u2014standing up for the nephew in front of others might have been seen as disrespectful to the nephew's parents. But the author's reasoning is sound. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew's right to continue using the machine. The answer should be B.\n"
