So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette between the nephew and an older man, and the author's reaction to their brother and sister-in-law's criticism of the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend supported the man's request, arguing that the nephew was younger, so his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't determine priority. Then, the brother criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nNow, the main points to consider: \n\n1. **Gym Etiquette**: Typically, gym etiquette suggests that if someone is actively using a machine, they should finish their set before others use it. So the nephew was in the right to not move immediately. The man might have been inconsiderate by not waiting.\n\n2. **Age Argument**: The parents' reasoning that age makes the man's workout more important is problematic. Age doesn't inherently make one person's needs more valid than another's. The author's argument that both workouts are equal seems valid.\n\n3. **Family Dynamics**: The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not be the best person to intervene. However, supporting a reasonable stance doesn't equate to disrespect unless it's done in a disrespectful manner. The brother's reaction of \"respect your elders\" is a cultural norm, but norms can be challenged if they're unfair.\n\n4. **Respect and Disrespect**: The author's disagreement could be seen as a stand for fairness, but if it came off as disrespectful to the brother, maybe there's some fault in how it was handled. However, the issue is more about the validity of the argument than the tone.\n\nPutting it all together: The author's reasoning makes sense. The nephew was justified in staying on the machine, and the age argument is flawed. The brother's emphasis on respecting elders is a social norm, but it's not a moral obligation if it leads to unfair treatment. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by the correct gym etiquette and fair treatment. The key is that the author's stance was based on valid reasoning, not just siding without cause. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
