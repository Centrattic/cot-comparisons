So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend side with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, arguing that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actual situation. At the gym, if someone is using a machine, it's generally understood that they should finish their set before others use it. So the nephew was in his right place by not moving immediately. The parents' reasoning is based on age, implying that the older man's workout is more important. But age isn't a valid factor in gym etiquette. The main rule is to finish your set, regardless of age. The author supports the nephew here, which seems correct.\n\nBut the author's conflict is with their brother and girlfriend, leading to tension. The author is being asked if they were wrong for siding with the nephew. Culturally, \"respect your elders\" is a common saying, but in this context, it's about gym etiquette, not respect per se. The author isn't disrespecting elders in a traditional sense; they're challenging incorrect reasoning. The brother is upset because the author publicly disagreed with him, which might have caused embarrassment. However, the author's stance is based on fairness and correct gym rules. \n\nThe author isn't the nephew's parent, so they have a right to voice their opinion. The issue is more about the parents' flawed logic than the author's right to express their view. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by the correct reasoning, even if they caused some family tension. So the answer should be B.\n"
