So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement between the nephew and a 30-year-old man at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked by the man. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, but the author disagrees, thinking age doesn't make one's workout more important.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The nephew was on a machine and didn't want to move. The man asked him to, and the nephew declined. The parents' reasoning is based on age, implying the older person's needs are more important. The author thinks that's unreasonable.\n\nIs the nephew wrong for not moving? Well, in a gym, there are usually rules about equipment sharing. If the machine has a rule that you should move after a certain time or when someone is waiting, then the nephew might be in the wrong. But if the machine is free to use for as long as someone is on it, then the nephew's right to use it until he's done is valid. The problem here is that the nephew was asked to move but didn't, and the parents are taking the side of the older person purely based on age.\n\nThe author's stance is that age shouldn't determine the importance of someone's workout. That makes sense because everyone has equal rights to use the gym facilities. The parents' argument seems to be based on tradition or social norms of respecting elders, which might not apply in this context. The author is defending the nephew's right to use the machine as he's entitled to.\n\nNow, considering the family dynamics. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in and disagreeing with the parents could be seen as overstepping, especially if they publicly criticized them. However, the author's reasoning is based on fairness and equality, not disrespect. The brother's reaction of \"talking shit\" suggests family tension, but the author's position isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the nephew's action. The nephew's action could be right if the gym rules don't prioritize age. The author's support is based on valid reasoning. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother and parents, leading to family conflict. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding the situation, not the family conflict itself.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's reasoning is fair and the nephew's action is justifiable unless there's a specific rule against it. The parents' argument based on age is flawed, and the author isn't wrong for pointing that out.\n"
