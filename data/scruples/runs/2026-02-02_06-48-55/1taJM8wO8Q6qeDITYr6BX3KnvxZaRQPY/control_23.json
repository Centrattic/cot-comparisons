So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author's brother, sister-in-law, their kids (14-year-old nephew and daughter), and the author plus his girlfriend had dinner. They were talking about the gym, and the nephew made some negative comments about the gym community. When asked why, he said that a 30-year-old man told him to move off a machine, but the nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents of the nephew (author's brother and sister-in-law) said the nephew was wrong, and the girlfriend agreed. The author disagreed, thinking the nephew was right because he was using the machine and the man had no authority to make him move. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders, and the author feels bad for not being the father and for disrespecting his brother in front of the kids.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the nephew was wrong to refuse moving from the machine when asked by the man. The parents' reasoning was that the nephew was younger, so his workout was less important, and that he should respect elders. The author thinks age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nFirst, from a social etiquette perspective, the 30-year-old man might have assumed the nephew was done because maybe the nephew was taking too long, or perhaps the machine is shared and the man wanted to use it. But the nephew was in the middle of his workout. In such situations, it's common to wait until the person is finished unless there's a specific time limit. So the nephew had the right to finish his set. The parents saying he should move because he's younger is ageist, as the author pointed out. Age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first if both are there for their own workouts. The author's stance that the nephew was right and the parents were wrong makes sense here.\n\nThen, the author's disagreement in front of his brother. The brother and sister-in-law are the parents, so the author, as a relative, might have felt it was their role to discipline the child. By siding with the nephew, the author might be seen as undermining their parenting. However, the author's point about the logic being flawed is valid. Disagreeing with in-laws in front of their kids can be seen as disrespectful, which the brother is pointing out. But whether that's actually wrong depends on the family dynamics. If the author's criticism was harsh or disrespectful, then maybe. But the context suggests he was expressing his opinion, which is his right.\n\nSo the core of the issue is whether the nephew was wrong. The author's reasoning is sound: age doesn't determine the validity of using the machine. The parents' reasoning is flawed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The brother's reaction is about family roles, but the author isn't necessarily wrong in supporting his nephew based on the facts. The author's mistake might be in the manner of disagreement, but the content of his argument is justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
