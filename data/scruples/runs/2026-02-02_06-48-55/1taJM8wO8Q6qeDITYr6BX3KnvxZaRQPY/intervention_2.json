So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves the nephew being told by a 30-year-old man to move from a gym machine, which the nephew refused. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's stance is right or wrong. The main points here are about respecting elders and fairness in a public space like a gym. The author's nephew was using the machine and wasn't done, so he wasn't obligated to move. The parents and girlfriend's reasoning is based on the idea that older people's needs should take precedence, which the author finds illogical.\n\nRespecting elders is a common cultural norm, but applying it in this context might be seen as prioritizing age over fairness. In a gym, it's generally about taking turns, not age. The author's argument is that both parties have equal right to use the equipment based on their own schedules, not age. \n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, especially since they're not the parent. The brother might feel disrespected, which could affect family dynamics. But the core issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. The author's support for the nephew is based on a principle of fairness, which is valid. The problem arises in how the author expressed their disagreement, possibly causing tension.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The reasoning for siding with the nephew is logical, but the way they did it might have been inappropriate. But the question is about the stance itself, not the manner. Since the author's argument is about equality and fairness, which is reasonable, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong). However, the cultural aspect of respecting elders complicates it. But in a public setting, age shouldn't dictate access. So the author's stance is correct, but the way they handled it might be an issue. The question is about being in the wrong for the stance, not the delivery. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
