So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the scenario is about a family dinner where a nephew's behavior was discussed. The nephew refused to move off a gym machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The parents and girlfriend said the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up siding with the nephew, leading to a conflict with their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The nephew was using a gym machine and the older man asked him to move. The nephew said no because he wasn't done. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, so the older man's workout was more important. The author thinks that's not fair, so they took the nephew's side.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the nephew's action: refusing to move when someone else might need the machine. In a public gym setting, people usually share equipment. If someone is done, they move, but if someone is still using it, others wait. However, sometimes there's a social norm where if someone is almost done, others might wait, but if you're taking too long, that's impolite. The nephew might have been inconsiderate by not moving even after being asked, especially if the other person was waiting. But the parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author correctly points out is irrelevant. The actual issue might be about sharing equipment and etiquette, not age.\n\nThe author's problem was publicly disagreeing with their brother's parenting decisions, which could come off as disrespectful. Even if the author's point about age is valid, the way they sided with the nephew in front of the family might have been inappropriate. The author admits they're not the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped in the family dynamic. The brother felt disrespected, which is a valid feeling.\n\nSo, the author's stance on the issue (age not mattering) might be right, but the way they expressed it and intervened could be seen as wrong because they didn't respect their brother's authority. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for siding with the nephew despite knowing it might upset the brother. The answer hinges on social dynamics and family respect more than the actual gym etiquette debate. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for causing family tension by not backing down, even if their reasoning was sound.\n"
