So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with his nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move off a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger, but the author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter. Then the brother was upset about the author's support of the nephew.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about gym etiquette and respect for elders. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents argued that since the nephew is younger, his workout wasn't as important as the older man's. The author thinks that's not valid because both are working out for their health, and age shouldn't determine priority.\n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, usually, people are expected to be considerate and share equipment. If someone is done with a machine, they should move. But if you're still using it, you can stay until you're finished. The nephew wasn't done, so he didn't have to move immediately. The parents' reasoning that age matters here is a bit odd. The author's point that age doesn't make one's workout more important seems valid. \n\nHowever, the author is getting into a family disagreement by siding with the nephew. The brother felt disrespected because the author challenged his parenting in front of others. Even if the author is right about the gym situation, the way he expressed his disagreement might have caused tension. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author's reasoning about the gym situation is sound. On the other hand, he might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with his brother, leading to conflict. \n\nBut the core issue is the gym situation. The nephew was justified in not moving if he wasn't done. The parents' argument based on age is flawed. The author supported the nephew correctly in that aspect. However, the manner of the disagreement might have been inappropriate. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding the situation described, not the manner. \n\nSo the answer would depend on whether the author's support of the nephew was justified. Since the author's reasoning is correct about the gym etiquette and age not being a factor, he's not in the wrong there. However, the family dynamics part is about whether he should have intervened. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for his actions. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew when the nephew was right. The parents were incorrect in their reasoning. So the answer is B (No).\n"
