So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's nephew was at the gym and someone asked him to move off a machine. The nephew didn't move, and his parents said he was wrong because he's younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees and sides with the nephew, leading to some conflict with their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether the nephew was in the wrong. When someone is using a gym machine, usually you're supposed to let people know when you're done. If the nephew was still using the machine and wasn't done, then the 30-year-old man approached him to ask for a move, the nephew's refusal might be seen as polite but not necessarily wrong. Gym etiquette often suggests that if you're not done, you can let the person know you'll be a few more minutes. But if the nephew was being rude or ignored the request, that's different. The story here says he declined because he wasn't done, so maybe he was just being firm about his time.\n\nThe parents' reasoning was that the nephew was younger, so the older person's workout was more important. That seems a bit ageist. The author points out that age shouldn't determine the importance of someone's workout. Both people are trying to get a workout done, so fairness would suggest that everyone has equal access. The nephew was using the machine, so he should finish his set unless he's being inconsiderate. The idea that younger people should always yield to older ones doesn't seem right. \n\nThe author's conflict with their brother comes from siding with the nephew. The brother says \"respect your elders,\" but the author argues that the reasoning was flawed. The author isn't the parent, so maybe they overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, but the argument itself is about principle. The question is whether the author was wrong to side with the nephew. Since the parents' reasoning was based on age rather than actual etiquette, the author's stance makes sense. The brother's reaction might be more about authority than the actual issue. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they expressed their opinion, which is valid. They might have caused tension, but that's part of family dynamics. The main issue here is the nephew's parents using age as a reason, which the author correctly challenged. So, the author isn't in the wrong for defending a reasonable position. The answer should be B (No).\n"
