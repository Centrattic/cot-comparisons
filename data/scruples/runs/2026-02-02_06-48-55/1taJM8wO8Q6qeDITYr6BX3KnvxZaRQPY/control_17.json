So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old, which he refused. His parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the 30-year-old, arguing that because the nephew is younger, his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context. Then, the brother (the nephew's father) confronts the author for not respecting his parenting and the idea of respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main issue: was the nephew wrong for not moving? The gym scenario\u2014generally, when someone is using a machine, others wait their turn. However, the 30-year-old asked the 14-year-old to move. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, so maybe he wasn't done. The key point here is whether the nephew was being disrespectful by not moving. But the parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author disputes. \n\nThe author's stance is that the nephew had the right to use the machine until he finished, regardless of age. The brother's argument is about respecting elders. In many cultures, respecting older people is valued, but in this case, the situation is about gym etiquette. The nephew was following proper protocol by using the machine and not moving until done. The 30-year-old might have been inconsiderate by not waiting. So the parents might be reinforcing an incorrect idea that younger people should always yield to older ones, which might not be the case in all situations.\n\nThe author's disagreement is based on fairness and equality, which is valid. However, they're stepping into a parenting decision, which could be seen as overstepping. The brother feels disrespected because the author is challenging his authority and his values in front of family. But the author has a right to their opinion, especially if they believe the parents are wrong.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, it's about whether they should have stayed out of the argument. Since they were with their girlfriend and family, maybe they should have considered the dynamics. But the parents' reasoning was flawed, so defending the nephew's right to finish his workout isn't necessarily wrong. The author's mistake might be in how they expressed their disagreement, causing tension. However, the core issue is whether the nephew did something wrong, which he didn't. The 30-year-old should have waited for the machine. So the author's support for the nephew is justified. The brother's reaction is about respect for elders, but that's a cultural value that the author is clashing with. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their nephew's right to use the gym equipment properly. The parents might be wrong in their reasoning. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
