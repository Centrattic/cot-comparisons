So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette. The key points here are the disagreement between the nephew and the parents over gym machine usage and the author's stance.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. Gym etiquette typically suggests that if someone is using a machine and another person is waiting, the one using it should finish their set before others take their turn. There's no strict rule that age determines priority. The parents' reasoning seems flawed because the nephew had the right to use the machine until he's done, regardless of the other person's age.\n\nThe author's support for their nephew is based on fairness and equality, which makes sense. However, the author might have come off as confrontational by disagreeing with their brother in front of others, which could have caused family tension. But the core argument about the gym situation isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe parents used age as a justification, which isn't a valid reason in this scenario. The author's stance that everyone's workout is equally important is reasonable. Even though the author isn't the nephew's father, advocating for the nephew's rights in this specific situation isn't inappropriate. The real problem might be the method of confrontation rather than the stance itself. Since the question is about being in the wrong regarding the gym situation, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
