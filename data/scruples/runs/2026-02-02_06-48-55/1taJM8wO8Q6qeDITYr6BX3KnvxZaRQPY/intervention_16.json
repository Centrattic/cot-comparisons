So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict at the gym between the nephew and a 30-year-old man. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked by the older man. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong because he's younger, but the author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong to support the nephew. First, the core issue is whether the nephew had the right to stay on the machine. Gym etiquette usually implies sharing equipment, but if someone is using a machine, they should be allowed to finish their set. However, the man might have been waiting, so there's a balance. The nephew's parents argued that the older man's workout was more important due to age, which seems like a flawed reasoning. Age shouldn't dictate gym priority. The author's stance that both have equal rights makes sense. However, the author is not the parent and publicly disagreed with the brother, which could be seen as undermining the nephew's parents. The key is whether the author was wrong in their judgment. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which is not valid. The author's support for the nephew was based on fairness. But the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, leading to tension. So, the author's position was correct in the logic, but the way they handled it might have been wrong. The question is if the author is in the wrong overall. The answer might be A (wrong) because of how they handled it, not the reasoning itself. Or B (not wrong) because their logic was sound. The situation is nuanced. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the reasoning.\n"
