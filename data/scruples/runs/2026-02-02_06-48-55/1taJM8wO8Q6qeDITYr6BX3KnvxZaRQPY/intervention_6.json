So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew refused to move from a gym machine, and the author sided with him. The parents and the author's girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he was younger, but the author disagreed. The brother criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, the core issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. The nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished his workout. If he was in the middle of a session, it's reasonable to expect him to finish before others use it. However, gym etiquette often involves being considerate. If the machine was taking a long time, maybe the nephew should have been polite, but the request was to move, not to wait. The parents' reasoning that age makes the workout less important is flawed because age shouldn't determine priority in such situations.\n\nThe author supported the nephew against the parents. The brother took offense, citing \"respect your elders.\" The author's actions could be seen as undermining the parents in front of the kids, which might be disrespectful in a family context. Even if the author's reasoning is correct, the way they intervened might have been inappropriate. Publicly disagreeing with a sibling, especially in front of their children, can create tension and show disrespect for family roles.\n\nSo, while the author's logic about age not determining importance is valid, the situation is about family dynamics and respect. The author might have been right in their assessment but wrong in how they handled the confrontation. The key is whether the method of siding with the nephew disrespected the parents. The answer hinges on balancing personal opinion with family respect.\n"
