So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and the parents and girlfriend sided with the other person, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he was younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in that scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author isn't the parent, so stepping in during a family discussion might be seen as overstepping. The nephew's parents were trying to correct their son's behavior, perhaps emphasizing respect for elders. The author's argument is based on the principle that everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age. However, in many cultural contexts, \"respect your elders\" is a common value, which the brother cited. \n\nThe parents might have felt that the author undermined their authority by disagreeing in front of the family, which could damage family relations. The nephew's parents are trying to teach him social norms, and the author's intervention might have been seen as interfering. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's point about age not determining the validity of the situation is valid. In a public gym, everyone has equal access, and interrupting someone mid-workout isn't respectful regardless of age. The author might be right in that practical sense. However, the issue here is more about family dynamics and whether the author should have taken a side in a familial discussion where their role isn't to arbitrate.\n\nThe key here is the context of family and whether the author overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother. Even if the author's reasoning is sound, the way they inserted themselves into the family dynamic might be problematic. The brother's reaction about respecting elders is a traditional value, and the author's disagreement could be seen as disrespecting the brother, hence the family tension.\n\nSo, while the author's argument has merit, their approach in the family setting might have been inappropriate. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were inconsiderate of family roles and relationships, even if their reasoning was correct. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong due to the social context rather than the content of their argument.\n"
