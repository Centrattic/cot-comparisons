So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused, and his parents and girlfriend agreed with the 30-year-old, arguing that because the nephew is younger, his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. The nephew was using the machine and didn't want to move before finishing his set. The 30-year-old asked him to move, which the nephew declined. The parents' reasoning was based on the idea that younger people should yield to older ones, which the author found flawed. \n\nThe key points here are etiquette in gyms and respect for personal boundaries. Generally, in gyms, it's common courtesy to use the equipment for a reasonable amount of time and to be aware of others waiting. However, the 30-year-old's approach could be considered rude if he didn't wait politely. The nephew's refusal might be seen as standing up for his right to finish his workout, but if he was taking too long, that could be an issue. \n\nThe author's defense of the nephew is based on the principle that age shouldn't affect the importance of one's workout. That's a valid point because everyone's workouts are equally important to them. However, the social dynamics come into play here. The nephew's parents might have a cultural or family norm of respecting elders, which is a common belief in many societies. The author, by disagreeing with the parents in front of them, might have caused family tension, which is a consideration in whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe author's girlfriend agreeing with the parents could have added to the situation. The author's public disagreement might have been seen as disrespectful, especially since they aren't the nephew's parent. But the issue also hinges on whether the nephew was in the wrong to begin with. If the nephew was reasonable with his machine time, then his refusal is justified. If he was hogging the equipment, maybe the parents were right. \n\nHowever, the story doesn't mention the nephew using the machine excessively. The problem was the 30-year-old's demand. In gyms, it's usually about mutual respect and waiting politely. So the nephew's stance could be seen as correct. The parents' argument about age is arbitrary. Therefore, the author's support for the nephew seems justifiable. However, the way the author disagreed with the parents in front of the family might have been tactless, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for siding with the nephew. The answer depends on whether the nephew was in the right and whether the author's support was appropriate. The author's reasoning makes sense, but the manner of their disagreement could be problematic. However, the main issue here is the correctness of the nephew's action, not the way the author expressed support. Since the author's stance is based on a valid point about equality and the gym etiquette not being age-dependent, they might not be in the wrong. But if there's a cultural expectation of respecting elders, that could influence the answer. \n\nConsidering these points, the author's support for the nephew is not in the wrong because the nephew's action was reasonable, and the parents' reasoning was flawed. The author's main issue was the public disagreement, but the core of the argument is valid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
