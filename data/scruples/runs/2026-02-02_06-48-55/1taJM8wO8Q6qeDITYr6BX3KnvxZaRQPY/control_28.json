So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict at the gym where the nephew refused to move from a machine when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend believed the nephew was wrong because he was younger, while the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the scenario. The key points are: the nephew was using a gym machine, an older man asked him to move, the nephew refused, and the parents criticized him for not yielding to the elder. The author supported the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't determine workout importance. \n\nNow, considering the principles of respect and social norms. In many cultures, especially in family settings, respecting elders is a common expectation. The parents might have believed that their son should yield to an older person out of respect, regardless of the situation. However, the author's argument is that the nephew was using the machine and had the right to finish his workout, which is a reasonable perspective. \n\nIs the author wrong for disagreeing? Well, there's a difference between the action (the nephew refusing to move) and the reasoning (age as a factor). The nephew's refusal could be seen as polite or impolite depending on the context. But the parents' reasoning based on age might be flawed. The author's stance is about fairness and equal importance, which is valid. \n\nHowever, the social aspect is important. The author is not the nephew's parent, so they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the parents in front of the family. This could have caused the nephew to feel supported, but it might have also undermined the parents' authority. \n\nSo, the author's position on the issue isn't necessarily wrong, but the way they expressed their disagreement in a family setting might be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The core of the issue is the justification. If the parents were wrong in their reasoning, then the author isn't wrong for disagreeing. The answer hinges on whether the parents' reasoning was valid. If the nephew was in the right for not moving (since he was using the machine), then the author's support is justified. The parents' argument based on age doesn't hold weight, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
