So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement about gym etiquette. The nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and the girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger, but the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the core issue here. The main point of contention is whether the nephew was right to not move immediately when asked by an older man. The parents used the argument that the nephew, being younger, should yield to the older person, which the author found flawed because age shouldn't dictate workout priority. \n\nNow, considering gym etiquette, typically, if someone is using a machine and another person is waiting, the expectation is that you finish your set before the next person uses it. There's a general unspoken rule that you don't interrupt someone once they're in the middle of their workout. So the nephew was in his right to finish. The 30-year-old man's request might be based on wanting to use the machine, but the nephew wasn't obligated to move until he was done. \n\nThe parents' reasoning about age is questionable. The author is right that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. Both individuals are there to exercise, and neither's need is inherently more important. The argument that the nephew should yield because he's younger isn't a solid justification. It's more about respecting others' time rather than age.\n\nThen there's the interpersonal aspect. The author publicly disagreed with the brother and sister-in-law, which might have caused tension. They mention feeling bad for not being the nephew's father and for disrespecting his father in front of him. However, the author's stance was based on a valid point about fairness and gym etiquette, not just siding with the nephew for personal reasons.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's disagreement was justified because the nephew was in the right for not moving until done. The parents using age as a reason isn't valid. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have been unwise, leading to conflict. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their approach was tactful. If the author was correct in their reasoning, then they're not in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the reasoning was valid. Since the nephew was right to not move and the parents' reasoning was flawed, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
