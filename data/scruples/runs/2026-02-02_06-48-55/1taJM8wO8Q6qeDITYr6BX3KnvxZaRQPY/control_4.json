So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agree with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because the man was older. The author disagrees, thinking the nephew was right to finish his workout.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about who was right in the gym situation. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he should be allowed to finish before moving. The parents' argument hinges on the age difference, suggesting the older man's workout is more important. The author argues that age shouldn't determine the importance of a workout, which seems fair. \n\nThen there's the family dynamics aspect. The author publicly disagreed with their brother (the nephew's father) during dinner. The brother felt disrespected because the author didn't side with him. Even though the author might be right in the gym scenario, challenging a sibling in front of others can be seen as disrespectful, especially if the author isn't the parent. The question is whether the author was wrong for speaking up.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's reasoning seems valid in the gym context, but the way they expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate. However, the main question is about the author's stance on the nephew's actions, not the method of expressing it. If the author's reasoning is correct regarding the gym situation, then they aren't in the wrong. But if the way they spoke up was disrespectful, maybe they are. However, the question specifically asks if the author is wrong for siding with the nephew, not about the manner. So the key is the validity of the author's argument versus the parents'.\n\nThe parents' argument is based on age, which the author rightly dismisses because age doesn't determine workout priority. The nephew was using the machine, so he had the right to finish. Therefore, the author siding with the nephew is correct. The author's conflict with the brother might be a separate issue about family dynamics, but the main question is about the gym incident. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for siding with the nephew.\n"
