So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette. The nephew didn't move from a machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend side with the older man, citing respect for elders, while the author disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong in their stance. The key points here are about respecting elders and whether age determines the priority in using gym equipment. The author argues that both the nephew and the man have equal rights to use the machine until they're done, and age shouldn't matter. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to show respect to elders, which might influence the parents' perspective. However, from a fairness standpoint, if two people are using a machine, the person currently using it should have the right to finish before someone else uses it, regardless of age. The nephew's refusal to move immediately might have been rude, but the parents' reasoning that the older man's workout is more important because of his age might be flawed. \n\nThe author's main argument is that age doesn't determine the importance of the workout, which is logical. The problem here might be more about the etiquette of interrupting someone versus the validity of the reason. The author's defense of the nephew could be seen as standing up for fairness, but they might have overstepped by disagreeing with their brother in front of the family, causing tension. \n\nHowever, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and family dynamics. If the family places high value on respecting elders, then the author might be seen as disrespectful. But from a neutral perspective, the nephew's right to finish his workout isn't necessarily wrong, and the author's support for that might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the reasoning about fairness and equal rights to use the machine makes sense, even if the way it was handled caused family conflict.\n"
