So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew in a family dinner situation. The key points are the nephew being asked to move at the gym and the parents' reasoning.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and refused to move when a 30-year-old asked him. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout is less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong. Gyms typically operate on a first-come, first-served basis. If the nephew wasn't done, he doesn't have to move just because someone else wants to use it. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed. The author's support is based on fairness and equal treatment, which makes sense.\n\nNow, the author publicly disagreed with their brother and his wife, leading to tension. While their reasoning might be correct, the way they expressed it could be seen as disrespectful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance, not their delivery. The main conflict is between the author's support for the nephew and the family's expectations.\n\nThe parents might feel disrespected because the author didn't back their parenting. However, the author's argument is valid. So, the answer hinges on whether siding with the nephew despite family dynamics makes the author wrong. Since the author's reasoning is sound, maybe they're not in the wrong. But family tensions complicate things. Still, the core issue is the validity of the argument, not just the family dynamics.\n"
