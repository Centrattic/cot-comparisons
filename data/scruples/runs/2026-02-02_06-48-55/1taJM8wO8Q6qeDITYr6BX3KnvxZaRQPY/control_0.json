So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym, using a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and then his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong. The author disagreed, thinking that the nephew had the right to use the machine until he was done, regardless of the man's age. The brother criticized the author for not respecting the older man's authority based on age.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness, respect for elders, and standing up for someone. The nephew's parents used the argument that the older man's workout was more important because he's older. But the author argues that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, when people are using gym equipment, the common rule is that whoever is on the machine should finish before someone else takes it. The brother and his wife are applying a different standard here, prioritizing age over who is currently using the equipment. That seems like a flawed reasoning. The author is defending the correct principle here.\n\nHowever, the author is also a guest in their brother's home, and by openly disagreeing with the brother and his wife in front of them, they might have caused tension. The issue here is about family dynamics and respect. The brother feels disrespected, which is a valid concern because family harmony is important. But the author's stance on the matter might be justified based on the situation's fairness.\n\nSo, the author is not necessarily wrong for supporting their nephew when the parents' reasoning was flawed. However, the way they expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate, leading to conflict. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their position, not how they expressed it. Since the reasoning behind the author's support is logical (age shouldn't matter), the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
