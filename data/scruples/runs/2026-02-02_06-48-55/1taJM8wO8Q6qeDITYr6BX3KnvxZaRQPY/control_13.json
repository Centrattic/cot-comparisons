So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and declined moving off a machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The parents and the author's girlfriend said the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter, and then got into a conflict with his brother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The nephew was using a machine and was asked to move. He didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents argued that since he's younger, he should give way to the older person. The author thinks that's wrong because age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for siding with his nephew? Let's break it down. \n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, usually, people might take turns if it's busy. But if someone is using a machine and isn't done, it's not necessarily wrong for them to stay. The 30-year-old could have waited or asked politely, but the nephew had a right to finish his set. However, the parents' reasoning is that the older person's workout is more important because of age. That's a bit odd because age typically doesn't dictate priority in such situations. The author's argument that both workouts are equally valid makes sense.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's actions. He publicly disagreed with his brother and sister-in-law, which led to conflict. Siding with a family member can sometimes be seen as disrespectful to the parents, especially if you're not their parent. The brother felt disrespected, so the author might feel bad for that. However, the author's reasoning is valid. It's about whether supporting his nephew was wrong in the context of family dynamics versus the actual situation's rightness.\n\nIn terms of the actual gym situation, the nephew wasn't wrong for refusing to move immediately. The parents' reasoning is flawed. The author is right to challenge that. But in family dynamics, the way he expressed his disagreement might have caused tension. The question is whether his stance was wrong. Since the author's argument is logically sound and supporting his nephew in a disagreement over a flawed parental reasoning isn't inherently wrong, the answer would be no. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by a correct principle, even if it caused a family conflict.\n"
