So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym incident.\n\nFirst, let's recap the scenario. The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the man's side, arguing that the nephew was younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't matter in this context. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respecting elders versus the actual situation at the gym. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he had the right to use it until he was done. The parents and girlfriend's argument hinges on the idea that the older man's workout was more important, which the author rightly points out as flawed reasoning. \n\nBut the brother is upset because the author didn't side with the traditional \"respect your elders\" principle. However, the author's argument is based on fairness and equal treatment, which seems valid. The nephew was in the right for not yielding unless he was done. So, the author supporting the nephew isn't wrong in terms of the situation itself. The conflict arises from differing values: respecting elders vs. fairness in a shared space.\n\nThe author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, but in terms of the situation's merits, they were correct. The brother's reaction seems to stem from traditional values rather than the actual rightness of the nephew's action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for their stance.\n"
