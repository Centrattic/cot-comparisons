So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the nephew was at the gym and someone older asked him to move from a machine. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents of the nephew said he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, saying age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with the brother over it.\n\nFirst, the nephew's action: when someone is using a gym machine, usually you wait your turn. If the 30-year-old asked the 14-year-old to move, the etiquette is that the one currently using it should finish. But the nephew didn't move. That might be rude, especially if the machine is in high demand. But maybe the nephew was still working out and it wasn't a long time. The parents' reasoning was about age. The author thinks age doesn't determine importance, which makes sense, but the parents might be trying to teach respect for elders. \n\nThe author's side: they didn't like the parents' reasoning and supported the nephew. But in a family setting, disagreeing with a sibling in front of others could be seen as disrespectful, even if the author's point is valid. The brother felt disrespected, so the author might be in the wrong for causing a scene and not respecting the parents' role in disciplining their child. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be right in questioning the age-based reasoning. But the key is whether the author overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother. The author isn't the parent, so maybe they shouldn't have taken the side in front of the family. So, the answer could be A because the author maybe shouldn't have argued publicly, even if their point was valid. But B if the right side was taken. It's a bit tricky. The question is about being in the wrong, not just the correctness of the argument. The author's actions (public disagreement) might be in the wrong, hence A.\n"
