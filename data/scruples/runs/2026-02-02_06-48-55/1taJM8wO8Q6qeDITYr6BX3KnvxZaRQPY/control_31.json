So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move, but the nephew refused. The parents and the author's girlfriend said the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't matter here. Then the brother is upset with the author for siding with the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The main point of contention is whether the nephew did wrong by not moving when asked. The parents' reasoning is based on the idea that elders should be respected and their needs are more important. The author argues that age shouldn't determine the importance of someone's workout. \n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, generally, if someone is actively using a machine, it's considered polite to wait for them to finish before using it. However, there's no strict rule that younger people must yield to older ones just based on age. The key factors are who is currently using the equipment and whether they're done. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, so it's reasonable he didn't move immediately. The man who asked might have been in a hurry, but that's between them to negotiate. \n\nThe parents' reasoning seems a bit off because respecting elders doesn't necessarily mean younger people have to give up their spot automatically. Respect can be shown in various ways, not just by yielding in such situations. The author's stance that age isn't a factor here is logical. \n\nHowever, the author is not the parent of the nephew, so publicly disagreeing with his brother might have caused family tension. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for his opinion. The author's argument is valid, so he's not in the wrong for supporting the nephew's side. The brother's reaction might be about family dynamics rather than the rightness of the nephew's action. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
