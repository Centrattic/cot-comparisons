So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the scenario. The nephew was using a gym machine when an adult asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong, citing that the adult was older and thus the nephew should yield. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine who moves first. After dinner, the brother (the nephew's father) was upset, saying the author disrespected him by siding with the nephew.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, sometimes in shared spaces, people might expect to yield when asked, but there's no strict rule that younger people must always give way. The author's argument that both individuals have equal right to use the equipment makes sense. However, the context is a family setting where the author is not the parent, so stepping in to challenge the parents' parenting decisions in front of the family could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting family hierarchy and boundaries. The author might have a valid point in the gym scenario, but in the family dynamic, challenging the parents' authority in front of others could be considered disrespectful. The brother might feel that the author undermined his parental judgment, which is a social faux pas in many family contexts.\n\nSo, while the author's reasoning about the gym situation is logical, the way they intervened in the family discussion could be seen as inappropriate. The question is whether siding with the nephew in that context was wrong. If the author didn't need to take a stand in front of the family, then they might be in the wrong for disrupting the family dynamic. However, if the author felt it was a matter of fairness, the issue is more about personal values vs. family respect.\n\nI think the answer hinges on cultural norms around family roles and how much to interject in others' parenting. In many families, it's expected to support parents in their parenting decisions unless there's a serious issue. Since the author is not the parent, their disagreement might be seen as meddling, hence leading to the brother's offense. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the family hierarchy in that situation.\n"
