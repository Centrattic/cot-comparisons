So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend criticized him, but the author defended him, arguing that age shouldn't determine gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the core issue is the gym scenario. The nephew was using a machine, and the older man asked him to move. The nephew refused, leading to criticism from his parents. The author's stance is that the nephew was right to stay until he finished, regardless of age. The parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument, which the author found flawed.\n\nNow, considering gym etiquette, typically, people are expected to be considerate. If someone is using a machine, others might wait their turn. However, in this case, the nephew wasn't done, so moving immediately isn't necessary. The older man's request might have been based on impatience or the assumption that age grants priority, which the author correctly points out isn't valid. So the nephew's action could be seen as reasonable.\n\nThe author's defense of their nephew is based on equality and the idea that age doesn't determine the importance of one's workout. This reasoning seems sound. However, the author's brother criticized them for not respecting authority, as the nephew's father. The author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing, which could be seen as challenging parental authority in front of the child, possibly causing family tension. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the validity of the nephew's actions and the appropriateness of the author's response. The author's reasoning about the gym situation is valid, but the manner in which they sided with the nephew might have been tactless. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe that's not entirely accurate. The author's stance on the issue isn't wrong, but perhaps the way they expressed it could be improved. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their actions, not the manner. Given that the author's reasoning is correct, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But considering family dynamics, maybe there's a nuance. The brother felt disrespected, so maybe the author should have handled it more diplomatically. However, the core of the argument isn't wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
