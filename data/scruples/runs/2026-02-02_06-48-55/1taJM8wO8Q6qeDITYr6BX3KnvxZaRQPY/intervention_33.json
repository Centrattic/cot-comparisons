So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's brother and his family (including his 14-year-old nephew) visited. During dinner, they talked about the gym. The nephew had a negative comment about the gym community. When asked why, he explained that a 30-year-old man asked him to move from a machine he was using, and the nephew refused. The parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he was younger and his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine that. After dinner, the brother criticized the author for siding with the nephew, leading to tension.\n\nThe author feels bad because they're not the nephew's father and might have disrespected his brother. The question is if the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The main conflict is about whether the nephew was right to not move when asked. The parents' argument is based on age, saying the older person's workout matters more. The author thinks age shouldn't matter here. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, generally, people might consider being polite in shared spaces. If someone is using a machine, it's usually expected to finish your set, but sometimes others might ask to use it if they're waiting. However, the nephew was in the middle of his workout, so refusing isn't necessarily wrong. The parents might be teaching respect for elders, which is a common cultural value. However, applying that to gym etiquette might be a stretch. \n\nThe author's stance is that the nephew was right to stay on the machine until done. The author's brother is upset because the author criticized his parenting in front of others. The question is whether the author overstepped as an uncle.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Did the nephew do something wrong? 2) Did the author have the right to side with him in front of the family?\n\nIf the nephew didn't do wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong for supporting him. But if the nephew was being disrespectful, then the author might be wrong. Also, the author's brother might feel that the author shouldn't interfere in parenting decisions, especially in public. So the author's mistake could be not staying out of the parenting issue. But if the parents were wrong in their reasoning, then the author is right to disagree.\n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, there's usually a mutual respect. Maybe the 30-year-old could have waited, or maybe the nephew should have offered to move if he was done. But the nephew wasn't done, so he didn't have to move. So the author's support seems reasonable. However, the author might have been better served in discussing it privately rather than in front of the family. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n\nSo the author's reasoning is sound, but the brother might feel disrespected. However, the author is not the nephew's parent, so maybe they shouldn't have taken a side publicly. But if the parents' reasoning is flawed, then the author isn't wrong to point that out. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because their argument is about fairness and equality, and it's reasonable to support a child's right to finish their workout. However, the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate, but that's not the same as being in the wrong. So B.\n"
