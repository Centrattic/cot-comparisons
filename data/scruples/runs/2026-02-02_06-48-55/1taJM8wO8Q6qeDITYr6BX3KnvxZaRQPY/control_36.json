So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man, which the nephew refused. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed that the nephew was wrong because of his age, while the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked. The parents argued that since the nephew is younger, his workout isn't as important, implying he should yield to the older man. The author thinks age shouldn't dictate who gets to use the gym equipment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the nephew was using the machine, so it's reasonable he wouldn't move until done. The parents' reasoning based on age is questionable because, in general, people have the right to use equipment when they're already on it, regardless of age. The author defending their nephew's decision seems justified. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which caused tension. Family dynamics can be tricky, and even if the author's reasoning is sound, the way they expressed their disagreement might be seen as disrespectful. But the question is about whether the author is wrong in their stance, not necessarily the manner. The parents' argument is flawed, so the author isn't wrong to side with the nephew. The answer is B.\n"
