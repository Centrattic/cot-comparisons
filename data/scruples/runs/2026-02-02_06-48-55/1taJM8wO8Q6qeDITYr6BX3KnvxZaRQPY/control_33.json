So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner.\n\nSo the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout isn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the nephew was in the wrong. If he was using the machine and hadn't finished, then refusing to move until done is standard. Usually, gym etiquette is first-come-first-served unless someone's done. So the nephew's action seems reasonable. The parents argue that the older man's workout is more important due to age, but age isn't a factor in gym etiquette. So the parents' reasoning is flawed here.\n\nThe author supported the nephew, which is correct based on gym norms. However, the author is now being criticized by their brother for not respecting elders. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for disagreeing with their brother and the parents' perspective.\n\nIn family dynamics, standing up for someone else can sometimes be seen as disrespectful if it's done in a confrontational way. But the author's stance was based on the merits of the situation\u2014correcting a flawed argument about age. The parents' reasoning is invalid, so supporting the nephew was right. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they're not overstepping by disagreeing. The brother's issue seems to stem from the author challenging his authority or viewpoint, not the actual rightness of the nephew's action. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They correctly identified the parents' flawed logic and stood up for a fair gym etiquette rule. The answer should be B (No).\n"
