So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument. The situation involves the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him to, and the nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine who moves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: was the nephew wrong to decline moving, and was the author wrong to side with him. The nephew was using a machine and wasn't done, so logically, unless there's a rule that older people get priority, he doesn't have to move. The parents' reasoning was based on the nephew's age, which the author rightly points out is irrelevant since both are there to work out. Age shouldn't matter in terms of access to gym equipment unless there's a specific policy, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author's stance is about fairness and equality, which seems valid. However, the conflict arises in the family setting. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in might have been seen as overstepping. But the parents' argument was based on a flawed reasoning (age determining importance), so the author's disagreement isn't about the nephew's actions but the parents' justification. \n\nThe key here is whether the author was wrong to challenge the parents' reasoning. Since the parents' logic was flawed, the author was defending a valid point. However, the social aspect of disagreeing with a sibling in front of others could be problematic. The question is about being \"in the wrong\" in the situation, not just the validity of the argument. The author might have been right in the argument but wrong in the context of family dynamics, leading to tension.\n\nBut the main issue is the nephew's right to use the machine. The author is in the right for defending that right. The parents' \"respect your elders\" argument is a social norm but not a rule for gym etiquette. So the author's position is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
