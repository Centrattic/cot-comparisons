So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette. The nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done yet. The parents and girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger, but the author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: whether the nephew did something wrong by not moving. Generally, in a gym setting, people use machines in the order they arrive. If someone is already on a machine, it's customary to wait until they finish before using it. So the nephew was following that norm. However, the parents' argument is based on the idea that the older man's workout is more important because of age. That reasoning is problematic because age doesn't inherently determine priority in such a situation. The author's point about equality in usage seems valid.\n\nNext, the author sided with their nephew in front of the family, which led to conflict with their brother. The brother cited \"respect your elders\" as a reason. The author might feel they overstepped by not letting the nephew's father handle the situation. But in terms of the actual gym etiquette, the nephew's action was justified. The parents' reasoning is flawed because age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. The author's disagreement with their sibling's parenting approach is about the validity of the parents' logic, not about the nephew's actions per se. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expressing their opinion? If the author was respectful in their disagreement, maybe not. However, if they undermined their brother's authority in front of the nephew, that could be seen as disrespectful. But the main issue is the justification given by the parents. The author's stance that age doesn't determine workout importance is correct. So the author isn't in the wrong for defending the nephew's right to finish his workout. The brother's \"respect your elders\" argument is more about tradition than the actual situation. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
