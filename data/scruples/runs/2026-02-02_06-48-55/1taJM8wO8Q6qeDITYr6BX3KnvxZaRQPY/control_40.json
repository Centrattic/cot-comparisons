So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. So, the situation is about a nephew who was told to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused, and his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong. The nephew's parents' reasoning was that their son is younger, so his workout wasn't as important as the older man's. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the nephew did something wrong. If the man asked him to move while he was using the machine, the nephew had the right to finish his workout. In most gym settings, if someone is using a machine, you wait your turn unless they're done. So the nephew's refusal was reasonable. The parents' argument that age determines the importance of the workout seems flawed. Age doesn't inherently make one person's workout more important than another's. The author supports the nephew, which aligns with the logical stance that both had equal rights to the machine regardless of age.\n\nNow, considering the family dynamics. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not have the authority to side with him in front of his parents. However, the author's reasoning seems valid. The brother's criticism about respecting elders is part of a cultural norm, but in this case, the nephew didn't do anything wrong. The author's disagreement is a matter of opinion, but standing by the nephew's right to use the machine is justified. The author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, but the core issue is about the nephew's actions. The author's stance isn't wrong; the brother's reasoning is questionable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
