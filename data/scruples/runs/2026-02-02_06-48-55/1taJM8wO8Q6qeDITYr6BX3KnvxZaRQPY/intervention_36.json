So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where a 14-year-old nephew was at the gym and someone asked him to move. The nephew didn't move, and his parents thought he was wrong because the other person was older. The author sided with the nephew, saying age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. Now, the author is being criticized by the brother for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, the nephew's actions: In a gym setting, there's usually an unspoken rule about sharing equipment. If someone is done with a machine, others can use it. But if someone is still using it, you can't just take it over. So the nephew was within his rights to finish his workout. The parents' argument that age makes the other person's workout more important seems flawed. Age doesn't inherently make one's needs more valid in such a scenario. The author's reasoning that both should be treated equally makes sense.\n\nThe author is not the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a family discussion might be seen as overstepping. However, the author's main point about fairness is valid. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" is a cultural norm, but in this context, the author's stance was about equality. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They might have been in a sensitive position by challenging the brother in front of others, but their reasoning isn't necessarily wrong. The key issue is whether siding with the nephew was a mistake. Given the situation, the author's perspective seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
