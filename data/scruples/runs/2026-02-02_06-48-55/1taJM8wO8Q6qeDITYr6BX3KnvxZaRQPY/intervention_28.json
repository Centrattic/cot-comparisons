So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument. The situation is about gym etiquette. The nephew was using a machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, thinking he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend supported the man, arguing that because the nephew is younger, his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here. Then the author's brother got upset, saying they should respect elders.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's right in the gym situation. When someone is using a machine, generally, you wait until they're done before taking your turn. If the nephew was still working out, he has the right to finish. The man could have waited or asked politely, but the nephew wasn't obligated to move immediately. So the nephew's action seems justified. The parents' reasoning that younger age makes the workout less important is a bit problematic. It's not about age but about the right to use the machine when in use.\n\nThen there's the family conflict. The author is not the nephew's parent, so they might overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the nephew's parents. However, the parents' argument was based on an incorrect premise (age determining priority). The author's stance is correct in principle, but the way they expressed it in front of the family could have been handled better. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" is a traditional view, but it's not necessarily right in this context. The author's disagreement was with the faulty reasoning, not the person. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in supporting the nephew. The author isn't wrong for believing in equal rights to gym equipment regardless of age. However, the way they expressed their support in a family setting might have been tactless, leading to conflict. But the core argument is on the right side. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
