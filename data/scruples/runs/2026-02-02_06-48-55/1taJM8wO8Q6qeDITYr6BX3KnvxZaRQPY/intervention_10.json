So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves a disagreement over a gym incident where the nephew didn't move from a machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with his brother and brother-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The nephew was using a gym machine when someone asked him to move. He refused, and his parents argued that as a younger person, his workout was less important. The author took the nephew's side, arguing that age doesn't determine the importance of one's workout. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The key here is to evaluate whether the author's stance was inappropriate. On one hand, the author's argument that age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette makes sense. In many gyms, the rule is first-come, first-served unless someone is waiting longer or needs the equipment. But the brother's point about respecting elders might be a cultural or family norm. However, the author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not be the best person to enforce that. The author's disagreement might have been justified if the nephew was in the right, but the way the author expressed it in front of their brother could have been disrespectful. The question is whether the author's support for the nephew was wrong despite the valid point.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their values, but maybe the way they expressed it was an issue. However, the main issue is the content of the argument, not the delivery. Since the author's reasoning is sound (age shouldn't matter), the answer might be B. But if family dynamics and respect for elders are prioritized over the factual argument, then A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not just whether their opinion is valid. The question is about being in the wrong, which often relates to social norms. So, depending on cultural context, the author might be seen as disrespecting elders by not siding with them. However, if the author's argument is logically sound and the nephew's actions were reasonable, then the author is not in the wrong. I think the answer is B because the author's reasoning is valid, and the wrong wasn't in supporting the nephew but perhaps in the manner. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the manner. So the answer would be B.\n"
