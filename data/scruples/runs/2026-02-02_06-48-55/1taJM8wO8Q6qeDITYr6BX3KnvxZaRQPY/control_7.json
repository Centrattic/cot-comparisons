So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger. The author disagreed, saying age doesn't matter. Then the brother got upset, saying the author disrespected him.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about gym etiquette and respecting elders. The nephew was using a machine, and someone else wanted to use it. The nephew didn't move until he was done. That seems reasonable. Usually, when you're using equipment at the gym, you're supposed to finish your set before moving, unless you're blocking someone. But maybe the machine was in high demand? But the nephew didn't mention that. So maybe he was just finishing his workout.\n\nThe parents argued that since the nephew is younger, his workout was less important. The author thinks that's nonsense. Age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment. Both people are there to work out. That makes sense. But the parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument, which the brother took offense to. The author is now worried about disrespecting his brother.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was standing up for their nephew based on fairness. But since they're not the nephew's father, maybe they overstepped? But the nephew's parents were wrong in their reasoning. The author's disagreement was about a factual issue\u2014age not making the workout more important. So the author isn't wrong for supporting their nephew. The brother might feel disrespected, but the author's stance was based on fairness, not just siding with the kid for being a kid. So the answer is probably B, No.\n"
