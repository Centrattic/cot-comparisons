So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with their brother and girlfriend. Now they're wondering if they're the a**hole.\n\nSo, the main points here are the gym etiquette and the age argument. In gyms, usually, people are expected to share equipment. If someone is done, they move, but if someone is still using it, others should wait. However, the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The parents' reasoning was based on the man being older, so his workout was more important. The author thinks that's not valid.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's stance is that both people are there to work out, so age shouldn't determine who moves. That seems fair. The nephew wasn't being rude; he just wasn't done. The parents' argument hinges on the idea that older people's needs are more important, which can be a problematic mindset. The author is defending the nephew's right to finish his workout, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the author is not the parent, so stepping into the argument might have been inappropriate. They might have overstepped by disagreeing with their brother in front of the family, leading to tension. However, the moral stance here is about fairness. The author's reasoning seems valid, even if the way they expressed it might have been unwise.\n\nSo the question is whether the author's disagreement was wrong. Since the parents' argument is flawed (age shouldn't matter), the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out. The real issue is the parents' reasoning, not the author's support for the nephew. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
