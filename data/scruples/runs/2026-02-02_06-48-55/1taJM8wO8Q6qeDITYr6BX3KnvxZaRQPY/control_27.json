So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nSo the situation is that the nephew was using a machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, then his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and got into an argument with their brother afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong by supporting their nephew. The main issue here is a disagreement in opinion about gym etiquette and respect for elders. The nephew was using the machine, so there's a basic principle that you don't have to move until you're done, unless there's a specific rule. The parents' reasoning based on age might not be fair, as the author points out. \n\nThe author's stance seems to be about fairness and not letting age dictate respect in this context. However, the brother argued from a \"respect your elders\" perspective. Is it wrong to challenge that? It might depend on cultural norms, but in general, supporting a child's right to use a machine until done isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe author didn't physically intervene, just expressed their opinion. Disagreeing with one's brother in a family setting can lead to tension, but the author didn't do anything that's objectively wrong. The brother might feel disrespected, but that's more about the disagreement rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. Supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout without moving just because he's younger is reasonable. The brother's point about respecting elders is a cultural norm, but that doesn't make the author's argument incorrect.\n"
