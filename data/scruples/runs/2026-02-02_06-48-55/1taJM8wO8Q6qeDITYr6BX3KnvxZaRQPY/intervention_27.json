So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation is about a nephew who didn't move from a gym machine when an older man asked him to, and the author's brother and his wife said the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees and says age shouldn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked, even though he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because the man is an elder, hence more deserving of the machine. The author argues that both were equally valid in their use, so the nephew didn't do anything wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the social context of the gym. Typically, in shared spaces like gyms, there's an unspoken etiquette where people are expected to be considerate. If someone is using a machine and another person is waiting, it's common to finish your set and then move, even if you're not done. But the nephew was asked to move and refused. That could be seen as impolite or inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the parents' reasoning was based on the nephew's age and implying his workout is less important. The author is defending the nephew by saying age doesn't determine importance. The author might be right in that the man's age shouldn't affect the situation. But was the nephew's action wrong? If he was in the middle of his workout and the man just asked him to move without considering his current use, the nephew might have a point. But maybe the man had been waiting and the nephew was being rude by not giving up the machine. The author's disagreement could stem from protecting the nephew, which is natural, but maybe they overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling bad because they're not the nephew's father and might have disrespected their brother. That's a social consideration. Siding with a sibling's child in a disagreement with the parent can be seen as undermining the parent's authority. So even if the author's reasoning is sound, the act of publicly disagreeing might have been the issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's stance on age not determining importance is correct. But the nephew's refusal could be seen as a social faux pas. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the social norms of the gym and for possibly causing conflict with their brother. Alternatively, if the nephew was just using the machine and the man's request was unreasonable, the author's support is justified.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's brother felt disrespected and the author wasn't the parent, the answer might lean towards A. However, the moral argument about age could make it B. I need to weigh both aspects. The act of siding might have been the problem, not the reasoning itself. If the author was right in their argument but didn't handle the situation diplomatically, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the user initially thought AITA (Am I the Asshole) because the author took the nephew's side. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for the assistant's opinion. The user's own view is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant's answer could differ.\n\nConsidering typical gym etiquette and the parent's role in discipline, the nephew's refusal might be seen as wrong, but the parents' reasoning (age) is flawed. The author is defending a valid point but might have approached it poorly. The answer could be B because the author's reasoning about age isn't wrong, but maybe A because they publicly corrected their brother. Hmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew, not just for the reasoning. So if the nephew was actually in the wrong, the author is in the wrong for supporting him. But if the nephew's action was acceptable, then the author is right.\n\nIn gyms, people often wait their turn. If the nephew was on a set and the man asked him to move immediately, maybe the nephew was right to finish his set. But if the man had been waiting and the nephew was holding the machine for too long, then the nephew was wrong. The original story doesn't specify if the nephew was in the middle of a set or could have moved after a few more reps. The nephew \"wasn't done working out yet,\" which could imply he was still using the machine and the man interrupted. So the nephew's refusal to move could be justified. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author correctly points out as irrelevant. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for defending the nephew's correct action and challenging the flawed reasoning. So the answer would be B.\n"
