So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nSo, the situation is that the nephew was using a gym machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't dictate who gets to use the equipment first. After the dinner, the brother (nephew's father) is upset with the author for not respecting the hierarchy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is right in the gym scenario. The basic rule in gyms is that if someone is using a machine, they can finish their set before others take turns. So the nephew's action of not moving immediately is standard. The parents' argument that age matters seems flawed because the gym etiquette doesn't prioritize age. The author's stance that both workouts are equally important makes sense here.\n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. The author supported their nephew in front of the family, which led to conflict with their brother. The brother cited \"respect your elders\" as the reason for the nephew being wrong. The author is now feeling bad for not being the parent and for possibly disrespecting their brother.\n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, the author might be in a tricky spot. They're not the parent, so commenting on the nephew's behavior could be seen as overstepping. However, if the author believes the parents are wrong and the situation is about fairness, their support might be justified. The key is whether the author's intervention was appropriate. Supporting the nephew based on reasoning, not just being a parent, could be seen as valid if the nephew was correct in his actions. However, the manner of the argument and the family context matter. The author's brother felt disrespected, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's support for the nephew might not be in the wrong if they believe in fairness and correct gym etiquette. But the way they expressed it during a family gathering could have been handled better without confronting the brother so directly. The brother's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected rather than the actual issue. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but maybe could have handled it more tactfully.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
