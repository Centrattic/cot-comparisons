So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nSo, the situation is: the nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, and his parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger and the man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't determine the importance of a workout. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the nephew's actions and the author's response. The nephew was using a machine and declined to move when asked by someone else. The parents' reasoning was based on the idea that the older person's workout was more important. The author opposed this, thinking age shouldn't matter.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, in a gym setting, the person currently using the equipment is entitled to finish their workout. It's a common understanding that you shouldn't interrupt someone who's in the middle of their session. The man who asked to move might have had a reason, but interrupting someone isn't right. The nephew's parents are teaching that younger people should yield to older ones, which is a traditional \"respect your elders\" concept. However, the author is challenging that notion, which could be seen as a modern, more egalitarian view.\n\nThe author's side with the nephew, which could be seen as supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout without interruption, regardless of age. The brother's criticism is about not respecting elders. The question is whether the author overstepped by disagreeing in front of his brother and girlfriend.\n\nThe author isn't the nephew's parent, so their role is more of a supportive uncle. However, by publicly disagreeing with the brother and his wife, the author might have caused tension. The parents might feel their authority as parents was undermined. The author's argument is valid in terms of fairness, but the way they expressed their disagreement could have been handled more delicately to avoid family conflict.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the disagreement was warranted. If the author's stance was correct (that age shouldn't matter in gym etiquette), then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the way they expressed it caused unnecessary conflict, there's a case for them being in the wrong in terms of family dynamics.\n\nBut the main issue is the validity of the parents' reasoning. If the nephew was in the right, then the author is supporting the correct position. The parents' reasoning based on age is flawed because gym etiquette typically doesn't prioritize age. So, the author's stance is justified. However, the conflict arises from challenging the parents in front of others, which could be seen as disrespectful. But if the parents' reasoning was incorrect, the author's intervention might be justified.\n\nIn this case, the author is not in the wrong for supporting the nephew's right to use the machine as long as he's using it, regardless of age. The parents are being unfair by prioritizing age over the current user's right. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
