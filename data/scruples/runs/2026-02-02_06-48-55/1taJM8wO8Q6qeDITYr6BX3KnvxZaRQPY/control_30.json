So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a 14-year-old nephew who was asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew declined, and the parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because the man is older. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine who moves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. The nephew was using the machine and wasn't done. The man asked him to move, but the nephew had the right to finish his workout. The parents' reasoning is based on age, which the author finds flawed. The author's support for the nephew led to conflict with their brother and sister-in-law, who emphasized respecting elders.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the nephew was in his right to finish using the machine. The parents' argument about age being a factor in the importance of the workout seems ageist. The author's stance is about fairness and equal right to use equipment, regardless of age. However, the author is not the parent, so stepping in during a family discussion might have been tactless, leading to the brother's reaction.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was wrong in their opinion. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014age shouldn't matter in this context. However, in many cultures, respecting elders is a value, which the parents and brother are emphasizing. The author might be right in their argument but handled it in a way that caused family tension. The question is about being in the wrong in terms of the judgment, not just the social handling.\n\nSo, the author's belief that the nephew was right isn't in the wrong. The parents' reasoning is flawed, and the author's support for the nephew's right to finish is correct. The issue is more about family dynamics than the actual rightness of the stance. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
