So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation is about a conflict over gym etiquette.\n\nSo, the nephew was using a machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and the girlfriend agreed with the man's side, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger and his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the machine.\n\nHmm. The main point here is whether the author was right to support their nephew. Let's break down the reasoning. In a gym setting, generally, if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. But in this case, the nephew wasn't done, so he had every right to stay until he finished. The man's request to move might have been premature. The parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he was younger seems flawed because age doesn't inherently make one's workout more important. The author's stance that both had equal right to the machine based on their need to work out makes sense. \n\nBut the author is being criticized by their brother for not respecting elders. However, the core issue isn't about respect for elders but about gym etiquette. The nephew wasn't being disrespectful; he was just not moving when asked. The parents might be applying a \"respect your elders\" rule incorrectly here. The author is defending their nephew's right to finish his workout, which is a matter of fairness rather than age.\n\nSo, the author's disagreement with the parents is about a valid point of gym etiquette and fairness. The parents might have a cultural expectation of respecting elders, but that doesn't necessarily apply in this context. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their reasoning. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
