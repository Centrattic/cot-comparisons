So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym. The nephew was using a machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew said no because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying that younger people should yield to older ones. The author disagrees and sides with the nephew, which led to some conflict with the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: whether the nephew was right to not move. The author's argument is that age shouldn't matter; both were working out for their health. The parents' reasoning was that the older person's workout is more important because of age. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author's point makes sense. Gyms usually operate on a first-come, first-served basis unless there's a specific rule or a time limit. The nephew was using the machine and had the right to finish his set. The older man's request to move might be impolite, but the nephew wasn't obligated to comply. \n\nThe parents' reasoning about respecting elders is a cultural norm in many societies. They might feel that showing respect to older individuals is important, even in a gym setting. But the nephew's right to use the equipment without being asked to leave prematurely isn't about respect but about common etiquette. \n\nThe author siding with the nephew is supporting a principle of fairness over age-based hierarchy. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, especially since he's not the nephew's parent. In family dynamics, challenging a sibling's parenting can cause tension. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" might be more about defending his authority as a parent rather than the actual gym situation.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? The author's stance on the issue seems valid, but the way they expressed it in front of the brother might have been inappropriate. It's possible the author is not in the wrong for the opinion but might have mishandled the situation by not considering family dynamics. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The core of the issue is the author's judgment on the situation. If the author's reasoning is correct, then they're not in the wrong. The conflict arises from the family disagreement, not the author's stance per se. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
