So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was working out and another person asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and the girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying the older person's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with the brother and girlfriend. Now the author is being criticized for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the nephew's right to use the equipment until he's done, regardless of age. The parents' reasoning is that the older person's time is more valuable, but the author argues that both have equal right to the gym. The author's stance is based on fairness and equality, which seems reasonable. However, the conflict also involves family dynamics and respect for elders. \n\nThe author is siding with the nephew, which might be seen as undermining the parents' authority. But the parents' reasoning is flawed. The nephew wasn't wrong in not moving immediately; etiquette usually says to wait until someone is done. The man could have waited or asked politely, but the nephew had the right to finish. The parents' argument that age makes the workout more important isn't valid. So the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew's correct action.\n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, which could be seen as disrespectful in family settings. But the core issue is the nephew's situation, which the author correctly supported. So the answer is B (No), as the author is justified in their stance.\n"
