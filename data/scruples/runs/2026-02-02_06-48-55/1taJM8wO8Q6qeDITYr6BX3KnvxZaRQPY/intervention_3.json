So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew gets into a disagreement at the gym. The nephew was using a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew didn't move, and his parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger. The author sides with the nephew, arguing that age doesn't determine workout importance. His brother criticized him for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong in siding with his nephew. The key points are the nephew's right to use the machine until done and the parents' reasoning based on age. The author's argument that age shouldn't dictate who moves seems valid. In most gyms, the person using a machine has the right to finish their set unless they're done. The parents' stance that the older man's workout is more important because of age is questionable. \n\nHowever, the social context is important. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a family gathering might be seen as overstepping. The brother might feel disrespected, especially if the author contradicted him in front of others. But the author's reasoning is based on fairness, not disrespect. The question is whether the author was wrong in his judgment or in the way he expressed it. If he was respectful but disagreed, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he was dismissive of his brother's authority, that's a different matter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly due to family dynamics. But from a fairness standpoint, supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout might be correct. So the answer could depend on balancing fairness vs. family respect.\n"
