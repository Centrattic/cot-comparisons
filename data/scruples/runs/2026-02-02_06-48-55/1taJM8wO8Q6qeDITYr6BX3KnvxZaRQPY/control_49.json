So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The key points here are about gym etiquette, age, and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend think the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout isn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. In most gym settings, people typically yield to others when they're done with a machine, but if someone is still using it, they can finish their set. The nephew wasn't being rude, just finishing his workout. The parents' reasoning that the older person's workout is more important because of age seems flawed. The author is supporting the nephew's right to finish his set without being forced to move just because of age.\n\nThen there's the family conflict. The author's brother is upset because the author publicly disagreed with him. The author admits they're not the nephew's parent and might have disrespected their brother. However, the core disagreement is about the validity of the parents' reasoning. Since age shouldn't determine gym etiquette, the author's stance seems reasonable. \n\nThe problem here is that while the author's reasoning is sound, the way they expressed their disagreement might have caused family tension. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's belief that age doesn't determine workout importance is correct, so siding with the nephew isn't wrong. The issue is more about the parents' perspective versus the author's, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for defending their nephew's actions based on fairness.\n"
