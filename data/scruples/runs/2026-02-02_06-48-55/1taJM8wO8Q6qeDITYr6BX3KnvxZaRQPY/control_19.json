So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The scenario involves a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym with a 30-year-old man. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked, leading his parents and the author's girlfriend to side with the man because the nephew is younger. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter, and now his brother is upset, saying the author disrespected him by not supporting the parents' view.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for supporting the nephew. The key points here are about respecting elders and the context of the gym situation. In many cultures, respect for older individuals is emphasized, so the brother's perspective might be rooted in that. However, the nephew was on the machine and not done, so maybe the author is right in thinking he didn't need to move just because someone older asked. The parents' reasoning that the nephew's workout was less important because of age seems flawed. The author's argument is valid in a way, but the issue is about how he expressed it. Since the author isn't the nephew's parent, perhaps he overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother and sister-in-law. However, the core of the conflict is about whether the nephew was wrong. The author might not be in the wrong for taking his side, but the method could be questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the method. The answer would depend on the situation's context and cultural norms, but the author's reasoning is sound. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
