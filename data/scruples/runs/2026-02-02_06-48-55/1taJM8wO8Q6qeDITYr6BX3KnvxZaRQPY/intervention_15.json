So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and girlfriend side with the man, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author takes the nephew's side, arguing that age shouldn't matter in the importance of a workout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respect for elders and the fairness of the situation. The nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished, so the man's request to move might be considered impolite. The parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he's younger is questionable. Age doesn't inherently determine who has priority at the gym. The author is defending the nephew's right to finish his workout, which seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the author's decision to side with the nephew in front of the family might have caused tension, especially since they're not the nephew's parent. The brother felt disrespected, which is a valid family dynamic issue. But the core of the conflict is about whether the nephew was in the wrong. The author's stance is based on fairness, not just age. So, is the author in the wrong for supporting the nephew's actions? Probably not. The parents' reasoning is flawed, so siding with the nephew isn't unreasonable. The author might be in the right in terms of the gym situation but may have handled the family dynamics poorly. However, the question is about the author's position on the gym incident, not the family conflict aftermath. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
