So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nSo, the situation involves the author's brother, his wife, their kids (including a 14-year-old nephew), and the author with their girlfriend. They were talking about the gym, and the nephew had a negative experience where a 30-year-old man asked him to move from a machine. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here, and now the brother is upset, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the main points of contention. The nephew was using a gym machine when someone else asked him to move. The nephew's right to use the machine until he's done versus the other person's request. The parents argue that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, hence his workout matters less. The author disagrees, emphasizing equality in such situations.\n\nLegally and ethically, when someone is using a piece of equipment, others should wait their turn. However, there might be unwritten social norms in gyms where people might ask to switch, especially if the current user has been on the machine for a long time. But in this case, the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The parents' argument is based on age, suggesting that younger people should yield to older ones. The author counters that age shouldn't dictate who gets to use the equipment first.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they sided with the nephew, which led to conflict with the brother and in-laws. The author is questioning if they're wrong for not letting the brother's authority be absolute in this situation. The key here is whether the author overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, even if they were right in their reasoning.\n\nIn family dynamics, respecting the parents' parenting choices is important. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so criticizing the brother's parenting in front of others could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author's reasoning is sound, the way they expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate. The brother felt disrespected, which is a valid emotional reaction.\n\nSo, while the author's logic about age and workout priorities might be correct, the conflict arises from the social dynamics. The author might have been right in their assessment of the situation but wrong in how they handled the disagreement with the brother. Publicly opposing the brother's viewpoint, especially regarding parenting, can cause tension, even if the reasoning is sound.\n\nTherefore, the author's wrongness isn't in their belief that the nephew was right, but in the manner of expressing that belief in a way that disrespected the brother. The answer hinges on the social aspect of the conflict rather than the gym situation itself.\n"
