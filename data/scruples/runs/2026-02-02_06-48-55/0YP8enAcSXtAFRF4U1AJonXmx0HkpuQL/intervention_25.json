Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and they reacted in a way that made their family upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That might affect their judgment and how they responded. They were tipsy and had just taken a hit of a dab, which could explain why their response was more flippant or not as serious as it should have been. However, the fact that they were high doesn't necessarily excuse a poor reaction, but it does provide context about their state of mind.\n\nNext, the author was asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt they don't have a close relationship with. The author mentions that the great-aunt isn't a significant part of their life, just occasional gifts and meals. The offer is being made with a $25,000 payment. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance issues, and then mention they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the author felt the family was upset with them.\n\nNow, considering ethics and family dynamics, is the author in the wrong? Donating an organ is a major decision. It's not something that should be taken lightly, and the author was not in the right state to discuss it. The payment of $25k might raise some ethical questions about organ donation and whether money should be involved, but the question here is about the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's initial reaction was to question the age and their own financial concerns. That seems reasonable because they're considering the risks involved. However, the way they brought up the \"too high\" comment might have been dismissive or disrespectful, especially in a family setting. The grandma's decision to walk away suggests that the author's tone was hurtful or inappropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the author is seeking validation about whether they were wrong for not being okay with donating (which they aren't, as it's their body), but they feel bad about the reaction. The key here is whether the manner of their response was inconsiderate. Even if the author's decision to not donate is valid, their response could have been more thoughtful and less flippant, especially when addressing an elder family member.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in the way they responded, not the decision itself. They were under the influence, which could have led to a less than respectful or empathetic reply. The grandma's hurt feelings are a result of the author's tone and content of the response. Therefore, the author might be partly at fault for how they handled the conversation, even if the underlying refusal is understandable.\n\nHowever, others might argue that the family brought up the request inappropriately, especially under the circumstances. But given the family's perspective, they might feel that the author was disrespectful. So, the answer could swing towards the author being in the wrong for the reaction.\n"
