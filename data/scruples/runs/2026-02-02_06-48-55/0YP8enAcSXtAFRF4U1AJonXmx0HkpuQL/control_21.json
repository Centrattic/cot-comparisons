Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the author reacted in a way they're now questioning.\n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had taken weed. Their grandma brought up the request unexpectedly. The author responded with hesitation and a joke about the aunt's age, then mentioned their own health insurance concerns. The grandma walked away, and they felt upset.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Kidney donation is a big decision. The author isn't close to the great-aunt, so their reluctance is understandable. The family offered $25k, which might be a factor. The author's reaction was under the influence, which could affect their judgment. They also pointed out practical issues like insurance. Was the reaction rude? Maybe the joke about age was unkind, but given the context of being high and not in a serious state, maybe it was a flippant response. However, the main issue is the request itself. The author isn't obligated to donate, especially to someone they don't know well. The family's approach might have been abrupt. The payment could be seen as a bribe, which complicates things ethically. \n\nSo, the author's response was honest about their feelings and concerns. They weren't aggressive, just expressed reluctance. The fact that they later felt bad about their reaction suggests they're reflecting on it. The family's handling of the situation\u2014bringing it up unexpectedly during a party, offering money\u2014might be problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate and for not being okay with the way the request was made. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
