Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family asking them to donate a kidney. The situation is described in an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) format.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had used weed not long before. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their health insurance, and mentioned being high. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the reaction.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's reaction was inappropriate. Let's break it down. The family approached them in a social setting while they were under the influence. The author wasn't in a good state for a serious conversation. Their response seems flippant, especially the initial comment about the aunt's age. But the author's reasoning is valid\u2014donating a kidney is a major decision with health risks, and the financial offer might be a factor. However, the way they responded might have been dismissive or disrespectful, especially in front of others.\n\nThe grandma's reaction was to walk away, indicating she was hurt. The author feels bad about this. The question is whether the reaction was wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to donate a kidney. However, the manner of refusal might have been harsh. The author was under the influence, which could affect their judgment. But in a family setting, using a serious topic like organ donation while high could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response about health insurance is a valid concern, but the way it was said might have come off as insincere or dismissive.\n\nThe $25k offer is a bit concerning. Organ donation for money can be ethical in some contexts, but it's important to ensure the donor isn't being coerced. However, the author isn't taking the offer seriously, which might be why they responded that way.\n\nSo, the key factors: the author's state (high), the context of the request (social party), the dismissive tone, and the impact on family members. The author's concerns are valid, but the delivery was poor. The answer likely leans towards the author not being the asshole (B), but there's a nuance. Since the author isn't obligated to donate, their refusal isn't wrong. The way they expressed it might have been unkind, but the main issue is the family's approach in the first place. The author's reaction, while perhaps inconsiderate, isn't necessarily wrong given the circumstances. So, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
