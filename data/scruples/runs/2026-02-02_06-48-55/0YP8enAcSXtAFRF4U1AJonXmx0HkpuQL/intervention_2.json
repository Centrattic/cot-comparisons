Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The author was at a party, a bit tipsy from weed, and their grandma suggested they donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author made some comments that upset their mom and grandma, and now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were under the influence of weed and alcohol, which might affect their judgment and composure. That's a key point because being impaired can lead to saying things you might not say otherwise. However, the question is about whether the reaction was wrong, not the state they were in.\n\nThe author's response included a comment about the great-aunt's age and their own health insurance. The grandma walked away upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. \n\nIn some cultures or families, there's an expectation to support relatives in medical situations, but the author doesn't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. The financial incentive of $25k is mentioned, which might add pressure. The author's reaction was blunt and perhaps dismissive, which could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the grandma was trying to present it as a noble request.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to refuse. The way they reacted might have been inappropriate, but the refusal itself isn't wrong. The question is about the method of refusal. Being under the influence and making a sarcastic comment might not be the best approach, but the author is not obligated to comply with the donation request. The grandma's reaction (walking away) indicates the conversation was hurtful, but the author's right to say no is valid. So, the author might not be in the wrong for refusing but could have handled the conversation better. However, the user thinks they are in the wrong, and I need to decide based on the reaction's appropriateness.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's refusal is not the issue, but the manner in which they expressed it. The grandma might have been expecting more consideration. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was unkind or inconsiderate. The author might not be in the wrong for saying no but could have been more polite. However, given the context of being under the influence, the immediate shock, and the lack of a close relationship with the great-aunt, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. Alternatively, the way they phrased their refusal (especially the part about being too high) could be seen as dismissive. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the refusal is valid, but the manner could be better. However, the user's question is about being in the wrong, and the answer might depend on cultural expectations. In some views, the author's response was inappropriate, but in others, they have every right to refuse. Given the information, I'll go with B.\n"
