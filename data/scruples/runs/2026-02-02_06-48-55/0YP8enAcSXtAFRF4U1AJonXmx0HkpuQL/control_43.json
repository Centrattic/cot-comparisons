Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt.\n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. That's important because it might have affected their judgment. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney, and the author reacted with shock and made a comment about the aunt's age and their own insurance issues. The mom and grandma then left the conversation and didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the situation. The author was under the influence, which isn't an excuse but does explain why they might not have handled the conversation as maturely as they could have. The family members approached the topic suddenly, and the author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own financial concerns. \n\nNow, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author isn't obligated to do it, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. The financial offer of $25k might be a factor, but the author's health insurance issues are a valid concern. \n\nThe author's reaction was direct, which might have come off as rude, especially mentioning being high. However, the situation is sensitive. The family might have expected a more composed response, but the author isn't wrong for declining. The grandma walked away, indicating she was hurt, but the author's main issue is the manner of their response, not the refusal itself.\n\nIn ethical terms, while the author isn't wrong for refusing the donation, their delivery was perhaps inconsiderate given the circumstances. However, considering the context (being under the influence, the suddenness of the request, and valid personal concerns), it's debatable whether they're truly in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the refusal is personal and valid, even if the delivery could be smoother.\n"
