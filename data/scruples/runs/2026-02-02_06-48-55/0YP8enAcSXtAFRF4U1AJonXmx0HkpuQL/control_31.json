Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation involves the author being under the influence of alcohol and weed during a family conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were tipsy and had recently smoked a dab, so their judgment and composure might have been impaired. That could explain the offhand comment about the aunt's age and the author's hesitation about health insurance. \n\nThe family's request is a serious matter\u2014organ donation is a big decision. The author didn't agree to it, which is their right, but their response might have come off as dismissive or rude. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about the way they reacted, not the refusal itself.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. They were in a compromised state mentally, which can lead to poor communication. However, even if under the influence, being respectful is important, especially in sensitive topics. The author's response was abrupt and maybe not the best way to handle a serious family matter. But considering the circumstances (impaired state, the suddenness of the request), it's not entirely their fault. \n\nThe grandma's reaction was also immediate, walking away, which shows the conversation was tense. The offer of $25k could have been a red flag, as organ donation should be altruistic, not monetary. The author's concern about health insurance is valid, but bringing that up in that context might have been unwise. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't do anything illegal or morally wrong by refusing. The issue is the manner of their response. Since they were under the influence, which affects communication, it's a mitigating factor. However, they could have handled it more gracefully even if feeling unwell. The AITA community often considers intentions and circumstances. The author's main fault was the delivery, but the circumstances (intoxication) might absolve them. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is the refusal, which isn't wrong, and the response was influenced by being impaired. The author isn't the asshole for standing their ground, even if the delivery wasn't perfect.\n"
