Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, but they reacted poorly, partly because they were under the influence of weed and alcohol.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just used a dab rig, so their judgment might have been impaired. They didn't have a close relationship with the great-aunt, who they only interacted with occasionally. The family offered $25k, which is a cash incentive, but donating a kidney is a major surgery with risks. \n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance. They also mentioned being too high for the conversation. The mother and grandma were upset, and the grandma walked away. The author feels bad about the way they reacted but isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is not obligated to donate an organ, especially to someone they don't know well. The fact that they were under the influence might have affected their ability to respond appropriately. However, the way they reacted\u2014being dismissive and making a joke about the aunt's age\u2014could be seen as insensitive. The family might have expected a more respectful response, even if the author declined the request. \n\nBut considering the author's state of mind and the lack of a close relationship, their refusal is understandable. The question is more about the reaction rather than the decision itself. The author expressed their concerns but in a way that might have been rude. However, given the circumstances (intoxication and the nature of the request), it's debatable whether they're in the wrong for the reaction. The key points are the author's right to refuse and the appropriateness of their response given their state. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often considers intent and context. The author didn't mean to be cruel but was perhaps unfiltered due to being high. The answer might be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong for refusing and the way they reacted in that moment, especially under the influence. The family should have been more sensitive to the author's state and the nature of the request.\n"
