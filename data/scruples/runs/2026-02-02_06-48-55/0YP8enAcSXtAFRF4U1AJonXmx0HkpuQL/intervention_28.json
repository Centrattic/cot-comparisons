Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. They were tipsy and had just smoked weed, which probably affected their judgment. Their grandma brought it up during a party, and the author reacted with some comments that the family found offensive. The author is now asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for their reaction.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The author was under the influence, which might mean their response wasn't as thoughtful as it could have been. But being high doesn't necessarily excuse being dismissive or rude. The grandma introduced the topic suddenly, and the author's initial reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance. The mom responded by saying she's not that old, and the author mentioned their insurance issues and being high.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was not in the right state to have a serious conversation, the request was made in a family setting without prior discussion, and the author's response might have come off as flippant or disrespectful. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a major decision with significant health risks. It's not something to be taken lightly, and the author has the right to refuse. However, the way they reacted could have been more considerate. Saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" could be seen as insensitive, especially in front of the family. The author did mention their own concerns about health insurance and being high, which shows they tried to explain their state, but maybe they could have handled it more tactfully.\n\nOn the other hand, the family brought up the request in a party setting without prior discussion, which might not have been the best approach either. The author's right to refuse is valid, but their delivery might have been harsh. The payment of $25,000 adds another layer, as it could imply a transactional aspect, which might not be the best way to approach such a serious health decision.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author isn't wrong for refusing to donate a kidney. However, their reaction could have been more respectful. The grandma and mom might have expected a more serious consideration, even if the author ultimately refused. The author's comment about the aunt's age could be seen as dismissive, and the overall tone might have contributed to the family's upset.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for refusing, but their manner of response could have been improved. The family also has some responsibility for bringing up such a serious topic in a casual setting. However, since the question is specifically about the author's wrongness in their reaction, I think the answer leans towards them being at least partially in the wrong (A), but there's a case for them not being in the wrong (B) because they have the right to decline. But the way they said it was probably not the best, so maybe A is more appropriate.\n"
