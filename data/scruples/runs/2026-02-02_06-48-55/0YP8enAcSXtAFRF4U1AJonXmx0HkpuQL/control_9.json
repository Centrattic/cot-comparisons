Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and they reacted in a way that upset their mom and grandma. They're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed before the conversation. That's probably not the best state to have a serious discussion about organ donation. They mentioned that this is somewhat normal in their house, but still, being under the influence might have affected their judgment and the way they responded.\n\nThe grandma brought up the request, and the author's response was a bit flippant, asking if the aunt is \"kind of old.\" The mom responded, and the author then mentioned their health insurance concerns and that they were too high. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them the rest of the night. The author feels bad about how they reacted but is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nNow, considering organ donation, it's a big decision and typically requires informed consent. The author didn't want to donate and made that clear, which is their right. They also raised valid concerns about medical risks and insurance. However, the way they reacted might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially since they were under the influence. Their initial question about the great-aunt's age could be seen as insensitive, even if the intention was to express concern about the procedure's risks.\n\nThe family might feel that the author was not taking the situation seriously. While the author is entitled to say no, the manner in which they did so might have hurt feelings, leading the grandma to walk away. The author's self-awareness about being in a bad state for the conversation is a point in their favor, but it doesn't excuse a potentially rude response.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? They made a valid decision not to donate, but their reaction might have been inappropriate. They should have handled it more respectfully, even if they felt unprepared. However, the main issue is the right to refuse, not the way they said it. The answer might lean towards them not being the asshole, but there's a nuance here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not just about the refusal but the reaction.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) discussions, the key is whether the person's actions were unreasonable. The author was under the influence and didn't handle the conversation well, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, they are not obligated to donate a kidney. The answer might be B (No), because they have the right to refuse, but their reaction was poor. However, sometimes in these cases, the reaction is considered part of the problem. The question is whether the way they reacted makes them the asshole. The initial refusal isn't wrong, but the flippancy and being under the influence might tip it towards A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if they are the asshole. So, maybe the answer is B because the main issue is the refusal isn't wrong, but the reaction was poor. However, the user might be asking if the reaction makes them in the wrong. Given that the user is self-aware, and the main problem is the refusal isn't wrong, the answer is B.\n"
