Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation is presented in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had taken a dab of weed. Their mom and grandma brought up the idea of the author donating a kidney to their great-aunt, who's in her late 70s. The author responded with a question about the aunt's age and mentioned their health insurance issues and being too high for the conversation. After that, the grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about their reaction but isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants confirmation. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the context of the conversation. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which might have affected their judgment or ability to respond appropriately. However, it's not clear if that's an excuse or just a fact of the situation. \n\nSecond, the request itself. Donating a kidney is a major medical decision with serious implications. The author is being asked to give up an organ for a relative they don't know well, with a financial incentive. The ethical angle here is whether the author is obligated to do this. From a personal rights perspective, the author isn't obligated to donate, especially since they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. \n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their health insurance and being high. While the tone might have been dismissive, given the context (being under the influence), it's possible they were just being honest about not wanting to engage in a serious conversation at that moment. \n\nHowever, the way they responded could have been more respectful. The grandma walking away might indicate that the author's response was perceived as disrespectful or hurtful. The author's defense is that they didn't want to donate, which is their right, but the manner in which they refused might be the issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both the rightness of the decision and the appropriateness of the response. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate, but the way they handled the conversation might have been poor. The question is whether the author is the asshole for the reaction, not for the decision itself. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the response was indeed inappropriate. The author was under the influence, which could have affected their ability to communicate respectfully. However, bringing up the age and being dismissive might have been unkind. \n\nOn the other hand, the family approached the author in a social setting while they were high, which might not have been the best approach either. The author's response could be seen as a valid expression of discomfort given their state and the suddenness of the request. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing to donate, but the way they reacted might have been tactless. However, considering the context (under the influence, perhaps not the best time for such a heavy conversation), the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole. But the initial assessment was that the user thought the author was wrong. \n\nI need to decide between A and B. The key here is whether the author's reaction was the asshole part. If the author's response, while not ideal, was still within the bounds of being honest and setting a boundary, then they might not be the asshole. However, if the response was dismissive or rude, then A would be correct. Given that the author was under the influence and the situation was a party, maybe the reaction wasn't entirely inappropriate. The grandma walking away might be more about the emotional impact rather than the author being in the wrong. So, I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because they have a right to refuse, and the manner might be debatable but not necessarily asshole-worthy.\n"
