Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was approached by her mom and grandma at a party to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, who's in her late 70s. The author was under the influence of weed and alcohol, and she reacted with shock and some dismissive comments. Now, she's wondering if her reaction was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is 26, and the great-aunt isn't a close part of her life. The request is about a major medical decision\u2014organ donation. The family offered $25k, which might be tempting but also raises questions about being coerced by money. The author was not in a clear state of mind when the conversation happened, which is a key point. She was tipsy and high, so her response might have been impulsive and not well-considered.\n\nHer reply included asking if the great-aunt is \"not that old,\" which the mom countered, and then she mentioned her insurance. The author's tone here could be seen as flippant or dismissive, especially the part about being high. That might have been hurtful to her grandma, who walked away. The author feels guilty about the grandma being upset and the way she handled the conversation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the request is huge, and the author is not obligated to donate an organ, especially to a relative she's not close to. Organ donation is a personal choice, and she has the right to say no. Offering money complicates things further, as it might feel like a bribe, but the author is within her rights to consider her health and financial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the way she responded might have been inconsiderate. She was under the influence, which isn't an excuse, but she should have been aware of the gravity of the topic. The comment about being too high to have the conversation shows she wasn't taking it seriously, which could be seen as disrespectful. The grandma was likely trying to be kind by suggesting a life-saving option, and the author's reaction might have hurt their feelings.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for declining the donation, but is she responsible for the way she reacted? Her response was abrupt and perhaps unthoughtful, especially in a social setting. She could have handled it more sensitively, even if she was under the influence. However, her state might have affected her judgment. The key here is whether the manner of her refusal was uncaring or dismissive. The grandma's walking away indicates that the reaction was hurtful, but the author's main point is that she's not the asshole for not donating, just for her reaction.\n\nGiven that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't handle the conversation with the respect it deserves, even if her decision is understandable. But I need to be careful here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the request was made in a situation where she wasn't composed, and she's being honest about her state. Also, considering the financial aspect, the author is valid in worrying about her health insurance. The grandma's reaction is also a bit extreme, walking away after a shocking comment.\n\nWait, but the main question is about the reaction. The author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and then mention her insurance and being high. The grandma was upset, so maybe the author could have been more empathetic. Even under the influence, the way she handled it might have been inconsiderate. However, some might argue that the family brought it up in a casual manner during a party, which wasn't appropriate either. But the author's response to a serious topic in a disrespectful way (being high) could be seen as wrong.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a tough call. The author is not wrong for refusing to donate, but the way she reacted might be. The AITA format often looks at the action and the reaction. Since the author's reaction was dismissive and made the grandma walk away, maybe she's AITA. But others might say the family approached her inappropriately during a party and under the influence. The author's mention of her insurance is a valid concern, but the initial question about the aunt's age could come off as insensitive. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the tone and the way she handled the conversation, even if her decision was reasonable. The grandma's hurt feelings matter here, and the author could have expressed her refusal more compassionately. Being under the influence is a factor but doesn't excuse the dismissive attitude.\n"
