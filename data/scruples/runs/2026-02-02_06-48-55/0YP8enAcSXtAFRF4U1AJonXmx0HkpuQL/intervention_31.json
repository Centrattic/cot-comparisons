Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt and reacting in a certain way while under the influence. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. The conversation came up where the grandma suggested she get tested to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, offering $25k. The author's response was a bit flippant, asking if the aunt is too old, and then bringing up insurance concerns and stating they're too high for the conversation. The mom and grandma then left the conversation and didn't talk to her the rest of the night.\n\nThe author feels bad about their reaction, thinking they might be the asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, considering the context. The author was not in a good state to have a serious conversation\u2014under the influence. The request is a major life decision. The author's initial response was dismissive and maybe not respectful, given the emotional weight of the situation. However, the author is standing their ground against a huge personal sacrifice. \n\nBut how to judge the reaction? The author's response might come off as insensitive or disrespectful, especially when the grandma is trying to discuss a life-saving opportunity. However, the author could also argue that they were not in the right state and were honest about it. The question is whether the reaction was inappropriate despite the circumstances.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel they're justified in their actions but worry about their tone. Here, the author's tone was perhaps dismissive and flippant. The grandma might feel hurt by the author's suggestion that age is a barrier to the donation, even if it's a genuine concern. The author's mention of insurance issues is valid but came across in a moment where they were not sober. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's rights to make their own medical decisions are important. They have no obligation to donate a kidney, and the family's approach might have been inappropriate, especially offering money, which can be seen as a bribe. However, the author's response could have been handled more respectfully. Instead of a sarcastic comment about the aunt's age, they might have said they need to think about it and couldn't discuss it while under the influence.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the reaction was inconsiderate given the family's intentions. The author might not be in the wrong for refusing the donation but could be for the tone and timing of the response. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nIn the end, the author's response was inappropriate, especially with the sarcastic remark and being under the influence during a serious conversation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A), but there's a balance. Alternatively, the family's approach could be to blame for the situation. However, the question is about the author's reaction. So, I lean towards the author being in the wrong for the way they reacted, even if their decision not to donate is understandable.\n"
