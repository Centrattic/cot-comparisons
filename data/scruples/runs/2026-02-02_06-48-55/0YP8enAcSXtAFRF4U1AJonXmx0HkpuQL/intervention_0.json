Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The author was at a party, a bit tipsy and high, and then the grandma suggested donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author responded with shock, mentioned their insurance issues, and said they were too high to talk about it. The family was upset after.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the context of the situation. The author was under the influence, both alcohol and weed. That might have affected their judgment and how they responded. They were in a social setting where substance use is normalized, according to them. But when someone brings up a serious topic like organ donation, expecting a considered response, the author was not in a state to think clearly.\n\nThe author's response was dismissive and maybe flippant. Saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" could come off as insensitive, especially if the family is trying to present this as a noble act. Then the author brings up their insurance issues, which is a valid concern, but maybe not the right thing to say in the moment. Also, pointing out being high might not help their case, as it could be seen as excusing a poor reaction.\n\nThe grandma walked away, and the author is now feeling bad about hurting their feelings. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. Legally, you can't force someone to donate an organ, so the author isn't wrong for refusing. But the way they reacted might have been disrespectful or hurtful. The family probably approached this with some hope or expectation, and the author's reaction might have been abrupt or unkind, especially given the emotional weight of the request.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was under the influence and might not have been thinking clearly. They also have valid concerns about their own financial stability and health. But the way they expressed those concerns might have been inappropriate in the moment. They could have asked for time to think about it or expressed their concerns more compassionately, even if they were stoned.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction was probably not the best. They might not be in the wrong for refusing, but the manner was definitely off. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because their response was dismissive and could have been hurtful, even if their intentions were to be honest.\n"
