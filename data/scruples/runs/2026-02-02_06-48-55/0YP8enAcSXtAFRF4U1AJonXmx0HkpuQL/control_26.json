Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author was at a party, a bit tipsy and had just smoked weed. They weren't in a serious mental state. The grandma brought up the request for a kidney donation, offering $25k. The author's response was, \"Umm... isn't she kind of old?\" followed by concerns about health insurance and the fact that they were high. Then the grandma walked away, and the family didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nSo, the author is questioning if they were an asshole (AITA) for the way they reacted. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the state of the author, and the appropriateness of their response.\n\nThe author was under the influence, which might have affected their judgment. They responded with a somewhat flippant comment (\"isn't she kind of old?\") which could be seen as dismissive or insensitive. However, they also raised valid concerns about their own health insurance and the inappropriateness of discussing such a serious matter while impaired. \n\nDonating a kidney is a major decision with lifelong consequences. The family approached the author in a social setting where they weren't sober, which might not be the best environment for such a serious request. The offer of money could also be a red flag, as it might complicate the decision-making process, making it more transactional than altruistic.\n\nThe author's reaction, while maybe not the most respectful in the moment, might be understandable given their state. They didn't outright refuse the request but expressed hesitation and practical concerns. The grandma's walking away suggests that the conversation was taken seriously, but the author's response might have come across as dismissive because of the \"isn't she kind of old?\" comment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the author was not in the right state to discuss such a serious matter. They did express their concerns, albeit in a less than ideal way. The family's expectations might also be unreasonable, given that the great-aunt isn't a close part of the author's life. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to donate, and their reaction, while perhaps not perfectly phrased, can be excused due to their state at the time.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's response was inconsiderate in the moment, but given their impaired state and the seriousness of the request, they aren't entirely at fault. They are not in the wrong because the situation was inappropriate to begin with and their response was a reflection of their state and concerns.\n"
