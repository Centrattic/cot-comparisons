Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the author reacted in a way that upset their mom and grandma. The author is wondering if they're the asshole (AITA) for the way they responded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just taken a hit of weed, so not in the best mental state. They were at a party, and the conversation came up unexpectedly. The family is asking for a kidney donation, which is a big decision. The author is 26, and the great-aunt is in her late 70s. The author mentions that they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt, which is a key point. Also, they point out their own health insurance concerns and that they're not in the right state to discuss this.\n\nNow, the author's reaction: they responded with \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioned their insurance and being high. The mom defended the aunt's age, and the grandma walked away. The author is feeling guilty about upsetting them but also doesn't want to donate the kidney.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key factors here are consent, mental state, and the nature of the request. Organ donation is a serious medical decision that requires informed consent. The author was under the influence, which could impair their ability to make or receive a rational decision. Additionally, the offer of $25,000 raises red flags\u2014selling a kidney is illegal in many places, so that might be a problematic aspect.\n\nThe author's response was honest about their state and their reluctance. They didn't outright refuse but expressed concerns. However, the way they might have dismissed the aunt's potential to live longer by questioning her age could be seen as insensitive. But considering they were under the influence and not in a meaningful relationship with the aunt, their response is more about being honest under the circumstances.\n\nFamily dynamics also play a role here. The grandma and mom might have expected a more respectful or empathetic response, but the author was in a vulnerable state. The offer of money for a kidney is ethically questionable, which adds another layer. The author has the right to refuse, especially when their own health and financial stability could be at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's response might have been blunt, their decision to not donate the kidney is valid, and their state of mind at the time is a mitigating factor. The family's approach was also questionable, especially with the monetary incentive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
