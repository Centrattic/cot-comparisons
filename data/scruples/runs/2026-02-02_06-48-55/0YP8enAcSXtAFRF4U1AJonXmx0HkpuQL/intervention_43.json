Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt, which they declined in what they now consider an inappropriate way. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That might affect their judgment and how they reacted. They were also surprised by the request, which was brought up suddenly. The author's response included a comment about the great-aunt's age and their own health insurance concerns, which may have come off as dismissive or insensitive.\n\nThe family members, especially the grandma, were hurt by the author's reaction. The author now feels bad about the way they responded but is unsure if they were in the wrong. The key points here are the author's state of mind during the conversation, the appropriateness of the request, and how the author communicated their refusal.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to refuse organ donation, especially when it's a non-emergency situation and the person isn't close to them. The financial incentive might also raise ethical questions. On the other hand, the way the author responded\u2014making a joke about the aunt's age and mentioning health insurance\u2014could be seen as flippant, especially in front of family. The author's admission that they were high and not in the right state of mind adds context but doesn't necessarily excuse the reaction.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's response was inconsiderate or if they were justified in being direct. The grandma was clearly hurt, so there's an emotional impact. However, the author's refusal is understandable given the circumstances. The question is whether the method of refusal made them the \"asshole.\" \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone makes a serious request, it's usually better to express refusal respectfully, even if one is not in the best state. The author's response might have been too casual or insensitive, but they weren't hostile. The use of humor about the aunt's age could be seen as dismissive. However, the author's health concerns are valid, and they have the right to prioritize their own well-being.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing, but their manner of refusal might have been inappropriate. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine if the reaction was indeed wrong. The answer might be that the author isn't the asshole (B) because they have the right to say no, and the context (being under the influence) might mitigate the bluntness. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong (A) for not handling the situation more sensitively. \n\nI think the key here is that while refusing is acceptable, the way it was done could have been more respectful. However, given the context (under the influence) and the suddenness of the request, the author's reaction is somewhat understandable. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong, because they have the right to refuse and the context matters. The family's reaction is also a factor, but the author isn't entirely at fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
