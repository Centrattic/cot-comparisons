Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which might have affected their judgment. They responded with a joke about the aunt's age and mentioned their health insurance worries. Their grandma then left the conversation, and the family didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nHmm, first, donating a kidney is a big decision. The author isn't obligated to do it, especially since the great-aunt isn't a close part of their life. The financial incentive of $25k is there, but that doesn't mean the author has to say yes. Their reaction was perhaps not the best\u2014making a joke about the aunt's age might come off as insensitive. Also, mentioning being high could be seen as dismissive or not taking the conversation seriously. However, they were in a social setting where drug use was normalized, so maybe that's part of the context.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling bad about their reaction. They acknowledge they didn't want to donate, which is their right. The key points here are whether their response was inappropriate. The joke about age could be hurtful, even if the author didn't mean it. Then, bringing up their health insurance issues might have been a valid concern but phrased poorly. The grandma's reaction of walking away suggests she felt disrespected. \n\nBut the author wasn't outright rude or aggressive. They were honest about not wanting to do it and mentioned their state of mind. Family dynamics play a role here. Maybe the family brought it up without considering the author's feelings, but the author's response could have been more respectful. However, the main responsibility lies with the family for approaching in a social setting while the author was under the influence. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to say no. But their delivery could have been better. However, since the question is binary (A or B), and the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to decide. Given that the author made a joke about age, which is a sensitive topic, and the grandma was upset, maybe A. But the author was honest and had valid reasons. Maybe B is better. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But from my analysis, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. Hmm. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to decline, even if the manner could have been better. The main issue is the family's approach, not the author's refusal.\n"
