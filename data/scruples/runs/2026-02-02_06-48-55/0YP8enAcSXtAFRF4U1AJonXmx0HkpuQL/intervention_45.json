Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt and reacting in a certain way while under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney, and the author reacted with comments like \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioned their health insurance issues. The mom and grandma left the conversation, and the author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's defense is that the request was unexpected and they were under the influence. They didn't want to donate a kidney, which is their right. But their reaction was dismissive and maybe a bit flippant, especially saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" That could come off as insensitive or making light of the situation. Also, mentioning being high might be seen as not taking the conversation seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to say no. The request was for a significant sacrifice\u2014donating an organ. The author might feel pressured, especially if the family is suggesting it with a financial incentive. The way they reacted might not be the best, but is it wrong? Maybe not, because they're asserting their autonomy.\n\nBut the way they phrased their response could be hurtful. The grandma was trying to bring up the topic gently, and the author's initial response might have been a bit rude. The author later mentions their insurance issues, which is valid, but the first reaction might have been more of a joke or dismissive. \n\nAlso, the financial incentive is a red flag. Paying someone for a kidney is illegal in many places and ethically problematic. The author's mom and grandma might be under pressure themselves and not realizing the implications. The author's response about insurance is a legitimate concern, but the way they brought it up in the moment might not have been the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for declining, but their reaction could have been more respectful. However, under the influence and in a family setting, maybe we can't hold them to too high a standard. The main issue is whether their reaction was inconsiderate. The author is not in the wrong for refusing the donation, but maybe the way they handled it could have been better. But in terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's debatable. The answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because they have the right to say no and the context of their state (under the influence) might mitigate their responsibility. But some might argue they should have been more tactful. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just if they handled it poorly. Since the author's refusal is valid, their reaction\u2014while perhaps not ideal\u2014doesn't make them the asshole. So, answer B.\n"
