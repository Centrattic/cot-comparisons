Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author was in a party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed, and then the conversation came up. Their response was a bit flippant and maybe not the best way to handle such a serious topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence, which might affect their judgment and how they communicated. Being high and tipsy isn't an excuse, but it does put the reaction in a different light. The family members, especially the grandma, were probably coming from a place of concern for their relative. The author's response about the aunt being \"kind of old\" might come off as dismissive or insensitive, which could explain why the grandma walked away. \n\nHowever, the author's main point is that they don't want to donate the kidney, which is their right. The financial incentive is tempting, but donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author's concerns about insurance and debt are valid. The problem here is the manner of the response. The author might not be in the wrong for declining, but the way they reacted could have been more respectful. The grandma might have felt disrespected, especially if the author was being flippant about a family member's health. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was disrespectful or if they were just being honest. The author could have expressed their concerns without making a comment about the aunt's age. The mom's response about the aunt's potential lifespan also adds pressure, which the author might not have handled gracefully. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being dismissive in a family setting can hurt feelings, even if the person is under the influence. The author might have been too blunt or sarcastic. However, the fact that they were under the influence could mitigate some of the blame. Still, in a family gathering, it's important to show respect even when declining a request. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not donating, but the way they handled the conversation might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because of the manner in which they responded, even if the content of their refusal is understandable.\n"
