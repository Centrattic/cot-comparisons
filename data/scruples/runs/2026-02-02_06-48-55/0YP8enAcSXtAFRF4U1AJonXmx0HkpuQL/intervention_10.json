Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The situation involves the author being under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just taken a dab, so their judgment wasn't the best. They were caught off guard by the request. The family offered $25k, which might be a bribe, but the author is not obligated to comply. \n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their own health insurance concerns. They also said they were too high to have the conversation. The family then walked away, leading to tension. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the state of mind during the conversation. The author wasn't in a position to make a serious decision, and they clearly stated their refusal. However, the way they reacted\u2014maybe being dismissive or making a joke about the aunt's age\u2014could be seen as hurtful, especially considering the grandma walked away. \n\nBut on the other hand, the family approached the author in a casual setting without prior discussion, which is inappropriate. The offer of money for a kidney is ethically problematic because it's not legal to sell organs. The author's refusal is valid, but their reaction might have been unkind. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for the way they reacted, not the decision itself? The reaction included a flippant comment about age, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author was under the influence and in a vulnerable state. The family's approach was also flawed. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be the asshole for refusing, but their tone and timing could have been better. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if their reaction was inappropriate despite the context.\n"
