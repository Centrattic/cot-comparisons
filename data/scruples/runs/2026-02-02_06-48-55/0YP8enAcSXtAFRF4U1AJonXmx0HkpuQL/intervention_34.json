Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a party, a bit tipsy and high. The grandma suggested they donate a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with a joke about the aunt being old and mentioned their insurance issues, and that they were too high to talk. The mom and grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nNow, considering the author's response. They were under the influence, which might have affected their ability to handle the serious topic. The joke about the aunt's age could come across as dismissive or insensitive, even if not intended. The grandma taking offense and walking away suggests the comment was hurtful. The author's main point is that they don't want to donate, which is their right, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate.\n\nFamily dynamics play a role here. The author might not have a close relationship with the great-aunt, so the request might feel out of nowhere. The offer of money is also unusual for organ donation, which is typically not monetized, possibly adding to the awkwardness. The author's response under the influence might not have been the best time to address such a serious topic.\n\nHowever, the author is justified in not wanting to donate and raising valid concerns about health insurance. The grandma's reaction was immediate, not giving the author a chance to explain. The key issue is whether the author's reaction was inconsiderate. The initial response was a joke, which isn't the best approach, but the underlying refusal is their choice. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author isn't wrong for declining, but their delivery could have been better. The question is whether they're the asshole for the way they reacted. The grandma took offense, so the author might have been a bit careless in their wording. However, given the circumstances (under the influence, not expecting the request), maybe they aren't entirely at fault. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but the options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Given the grandma's sensitivity and the author's dismissive joke, they might be partially to blame. But the main reason they refuse is valid. So maybe B (not in the wrong) because their refusal is their right, and the family's approach was also problematic.\n"
