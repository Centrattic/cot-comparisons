Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is the asshole (AITA) for their reaction when family asked them to donate a kidney.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman was at a family party, a bit tipsy and high. Her mom and grandma brought up her great-aunt's health and suggested she donate a kidney, offering $25k. She reacted with shock and said something about the aunt being old and her insurance issues. Then her grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to her the rest of the night. She's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The decision to donate an organ is a major, personal choice. 2) She was under the influence during the conversation, which might have affected her ability to engage seriously. 3) The financial incentive raises red flags\u2014kidney donation shouldn't be for money. 4) Her reaction was honest but maybe not tactful, given the emotional context. 5) The family's reaction (grandma walking away) suggests they were hurt, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong.\n\nEthically, donating a kidney for money is problematic. The offer of $25k might be a cover for something else, but even if it's genuine, paying for organs is illegal in many places. So the family's approach is questionable. Her concerns about her health insurance and financial impact are valid. She's also right to point out she's not in the right state for such a serious discussion. \n\nHer response was a bit blunt, but considering the circumstances\u2014being high, the sudden request, the financial aspect\u2014her hesitation is understandable. She's not obligated to donate, especially to someone not close. The family's immediate walkout and silence might be their own issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's pressure is inappropriate, the financial incentive is sketchy, and her reaction, while maybe a bit off, was honest. She's not the asshole here.\n"
