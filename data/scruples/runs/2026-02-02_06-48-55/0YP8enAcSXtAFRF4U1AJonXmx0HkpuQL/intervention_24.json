Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt when they were under the influence of weed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. They were shocked by the request and responded with a question about the aunt's age and their own insurance issues. The family members, especially the grandma, were upset and left the conversation. The user is wondering if the author is the asshole for their reaction.\n\nSo, the main points here are the state of mind (under the influence), the appropriateness of the request in that state, and the reaction. The family is asking for a major organ donation, which is a huge decision. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own financial concerns. \n\nOn one hand, being under the influence might affect their ability to handle a serious conversation. But the request itself is being made in a social setting, which isn't the best environment for such a discussion. The author's reaction, while maybe not polite, is understandable given the circumstances. They were not in the right state to discuss a life-changing decision. \n\nThe grandma's reaction to walk away might indicate that she was taken aback by the response. But the author's main point is about the wrongness of the request and their own right to refuse. The financial incentive (25k) is also a factor here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, you can't force someone to donate an organ, and the author is within their rights to refuse. The reaction was perhaps blunt, but given the context of being under the influence and the suddenness of the request, maybe it's forgivable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had the right to refuse and the situation wasn't handled well by the family either. The author's response, while maybe not the best way to handle it, isn't the fault entirely.\n"
