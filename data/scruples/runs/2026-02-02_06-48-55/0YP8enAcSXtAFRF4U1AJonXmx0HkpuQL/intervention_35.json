Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves family pressure to donate a kidney, and the author's reaction was to question the aunt's age and mention their insurance and being high. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected their judgment. They were in a social setting, maybe not the best time for a serious conversation. The family members asked for a major, life-changing decision\u2014organ donation\u2014which is a huge responsibility. The author's response was to make a joke about the aunt's age and mention their health insurance issues, which could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially when the grandmother walked away.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to say no to donating an organ. Organ donation is a personal choice, and they have the right to express their concerns. However, the way they reacted might have come off as flippant, especially in front of other family members. The grandmother's reaction suggests that the comment about age was hurtful. The author's mention of being high might mitigate some responsibility, but not all. People should be able to express their boundaries, but in a respectful manner. The key is whether the reaction was inappropriate given the context. The author's response was unfiltered due to being high, but they still have the right to say no. However, the way they phrased it might have been insensitive. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to refuse, even if the reaction could have been handled better.\n"
