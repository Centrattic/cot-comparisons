Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked, while under the influence of alcohol and weed, to consider donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author responds with a mix of confusion and refusal, leading to family tension.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction. They were high and not in the right state for a serious conversation. They made a comment about the aunt being old, which might come off as insensitive. The mom and grandma likely felt the comment was dismissive. The money offer could also be a point of contention, but the author's main issue is not wanting to donate a kidney. \n\nNow, considering the appropriateness of the reaction. The author wasn't in a clear headspace, which is a mitigating factor. However, the comment about the aunt's age could be seen as flippant. They also expressed concerns about their health insurance, which is valid but might have been better phrased. The grandma walking away suggests she was hurt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are the tone and context. The author was under the influence, which might explain their tone, but the content of their response could be seen as disrespectful. However, the main issue is the refusal to donate, which is their right. The question is whether the reaction was inappropriate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and context. The author's intent wasn't to be mean, but the response might have hurt feelings. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is within their rights to refuse, and the reaction, while maybe not perfect, isn't malicious. Alternatively, some might say A because the tone was poor. But given the context of being high and the family pressure, B seems more likely.\n"
