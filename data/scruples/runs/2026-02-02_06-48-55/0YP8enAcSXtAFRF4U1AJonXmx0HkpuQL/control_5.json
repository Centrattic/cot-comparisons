Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction to being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation is that the author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and when the topic came up, they made a comment about the aunt being old and mentioned their insurance. Their mom and grandma took offense, and the family didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence, both alcohol and weed, which might affect their judgment. They didn't know the great-aunt well, and the offer included $25k. The way they responded was pretty direct and maybe a bit dismissive. The mom's reaction was defensive, and the grandma left. The author is questioning if their reaction was wrong.\n\nLooking at the elements: The main issue is the author's reaction. The key points are the state of being high, the appropriateness of the response, and whether the family's request was out of line. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate a kidney, but the question is about their reaction. \n\nWhen someone is under the influence, their reactions can be more blunt or inappropriate. The author's comment about the aunt's age might have been insensitive, especially since the grandma took it as a personal insult. Even if the author was high, the way they phrased the refusal could be seen as disrespectful. The mention of insurance problems is a valid concern, but the way it's presented might have added to the offense.\n\nThe grandma walking away and the mom being upset suggests that the author's response was hurtful. Even if the author's intentions were to be honest, the delivery was poor. In family settings, especially during a party, how you express your disagreement matters. The author could have handled it more tactfully, even if they were not in the best state.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's mom and grandma approached them in a social setting to discuss such a serious matter might not be ideal, but the question is about the author's reaction. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to donate, but their manner of refusal could have been better. The answer would likely be that the author isn't completely in the wrong, but their approach was flawed. However, the options are A (yes, in wrong) or B (no). Considering that the author's reaction was hurtful, even if understandable given their state, maybe they are somewhat in the wrong. But the initial analysis suggests that the author's main mistake was the reaction, not the refusal. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), as the refusal itself is valid, and the reaction, while not perfect, might be excused due to being under the influence.\n"
