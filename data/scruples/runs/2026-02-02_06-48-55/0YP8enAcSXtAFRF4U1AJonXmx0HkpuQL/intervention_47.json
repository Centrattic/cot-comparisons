Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt, and they reacted in a way that upset their family. The author is unsure if their reaction was appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was tipsy and had just taken a dab, so not in a sober state. They were in a social setting, a family party, and the conversation came up out of nowhere. The family offered $25k, which might be a factor. The author's response was dismissive and maybe flippant, especially the first comment about the aunt being \"kind of old.\" That could be seen as insensitive. Also, the author brought up their insurance concerns and said they were too high for the conversation, which might have been unkind.\n\nBut wait, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author has the right to be hesitant. The family brought up the request in a casual setting, which isn't the best approach. The author's reaction, while maybe blunt, might be justified given the circumstances. They didn't commit to anything but expressed their reservations. The family might have been too pushy, expecting a serious answer in a social setting. Also, the financial aspect (offering $25k) could be a red flag, possibly implying a transactional relationship, which is problematic for organ donation.\n\nThe author's main guilt is about the way they reacted, not the decision itself. They were under the influence, which might have made them less composed, but that's part of the situation. The question is whether their reaction was wrong. The key points are: 1) The request was brought up inappropriately, 2) The author was not in the right state, 3) The response was maybe too dismissive, but understandable given the context. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decline, and their reaction, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was in a moment of stress and under the influence. The family should have had a more private and thoughtful discussion. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
