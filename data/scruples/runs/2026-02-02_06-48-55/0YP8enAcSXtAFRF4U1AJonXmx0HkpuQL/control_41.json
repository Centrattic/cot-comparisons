Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. They were in a relaxed state, which might affect their ability to handle a serious conversation. The family brought up the kidney donation request suddenly. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and express concerns about their own insurance and being too high to discuss it. The grandma walked away, and the author is now feeling bad about their reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From a moral standpoint, donating a kidney is a big decision. The author isn't obligated to do it, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. Their concerns about insurance and financial risks are valid. However, the way they reacted might have been abrupt or dismissive. The grandma might have felt disrespected or hurt by the author's tone, especially the comment about the aunt's age, even if it was a flippant way to express hesitation.\n\nBut considering the author's state (under the influence), the suddenness of the request, and the fact that they did voice their concerns, it's possible their reaction wasn't malicious. They might not have intended to be rude, just overwhelmed. The grandma walked away, which could indicate she took it personally, but the author was just trying to set boundaries.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation of respect in family matters, but pushing someone to make such a big decision in a casual setting is also inappropriate. The family should have approached this more sensitively, maybe after the party when everyone was sober and could discuss it properly. The author's response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was a reasonable reaction to an uncomfortable and potentially coercive situation.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for declining and the situation was handled poorly by both sides. The author's state at the time (under the influence) also plays a role in how they responded, which isn't their fault. The key is that the author isn't obligated to donate, and their response, while maybe not perfect, was honest given the circumstances.\n"
