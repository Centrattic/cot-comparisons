Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 26-year-old woman who was at a family party. She was tipsy and had just taken a dab of weed, so not in a clear state of mind. Her mom and grandma approached her to discuss donating a kidney to her great-aunt, who's in her late 70s. The offer includes $25,000. The author responds with a question about the aunt's age and her own health insurance concerns, and mentions she's too high for the conversation. Then her grandma walks away, and the author felt upset that they didn't talk to her the rest of the night. She's questioning if she was in the wrong for her reaction.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which affected her ability to have a serious conversation. That's a key point because being impaired can affect how someone communicates and processes information. Her response was perhaps not the best, but was it inconsiderate?\n\nThe grandma brought up a serious topic\u2014organ donation\u2014which is a huge decision. The author's initial reaction was to question the aunt's age, which could be seen as dismissive or insensitive. However, the author also raised valid concerns about her health insurance, which is a practical consideration. She also mentioned she wasn't in the right state to discuss it, which is honest but perhaps not the best way to handle it.\n\nThe grandma walked away, which suggests she was hurt or upset. The author is now worried she's the asshole for the way she reacted, not just the decision to not donate. The question is whether the reaction was wrong, not the decision itself.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, bringing up the age question in that context might come off as callous. Organ donation is a serious matter, and making a comment about the recipient's age, even if it's a genuine concern (like viability of the donation), can be perceived as not taking the request seriously. Also, the author was under the influence, which might have led to an unfiltered response. But the author did express valid concerns about her own financial situation and health insurance, which are legitimate factors. The fact that she was honest about being impaired might also be a mitigating factor\u2014maybe she wasn't thinking straight, so her reaction wasn't intentional. \n\nOn the other hand, the grandma and mom approached her with a significant request, and the author's reaction could have been more diplomatic. Even if she was impaired, how she communicated her refusal might have contributed to the tension. The grandma walking away suggests that the tone of the author's response was hurtful or dismissive, which could make her partially responsible for the fallout.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the question is about the reaction rather than the decision, then her initial question about age and the manner in which she brought up her concerns might have been inappropriate. However, considering her state (impaired) and the valid concerns she had, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the way she reacted (using the \"isn't she kind of old?\" as a first response) might be seen as insensitive, especially in a family setting. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the reaction was inconsiderate. The author's response might have been inappropriate given the context. Even though she was impaired, she could have handled the conversation better. So, leaning towards A (yes, in the wrong) because the way she reacted was not respectful to the family's request, even if her concerns were valid. But there's a nuance here because the offer of $25k might raise questions about whether it's an ethical request, but the question is about the author's reaction.\n"
