Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for their reaction to being asked to donate a kidney to a relative. The situation involves the author being under the influence of alcohol and weed when the request is made, and their response is somewhat flippant and dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which might have affected their judgment and ability to handle a serious conversation. The family members brought up the request in the middle of a party, which isn't the best setting for such a heavy topic. The author's response\u2014questioning the aunt's age and mentioning their insurance\u2014could come off as insensitive or not taking the matter seriously. However, the author did express that they were under the influence and not in the right state for a serious discussion, which might mitigate some blame.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's statement about their insurance and the debt issue could be seen as prioritizing their own financial concerns over their relative's health. But it's also a realistic concern; medical complications can lead to debt, and the author is within their rights to be cautious. The grandma walking away and the mom's disappointment suggest that the family felt the response was hurtful, but the author's intention wasn't malicious.\n\nThe question is whether the reaction was inappropriate. The author did state they were not in the right frame of mind, so maybe they didn't handle it well but aren't entirely at fault. However, the way the request was made might also be questionable\u2014pushing a major decision during a party after someone's had a lot to drink. The offer of $25,000 could also raise ethical issues, as it might pressure the donor, but the author didn't accept it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did say they're not donating, which is their right, but their manner of refusal might have been abrupt. Still, considering the context of being under the influence and the suddenness of the request, it's possible they're not the sole party at fault. The family might have approached the situation poorly. \n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author's reaction was perhaps not the best, but given the circumstances, it's debatable whether they're in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the context of being under the influence and the family's approach might share responsibility.\n"
