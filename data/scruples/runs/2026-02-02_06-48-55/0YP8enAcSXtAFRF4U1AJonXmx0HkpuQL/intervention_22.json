Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conversation where the author is asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author reacts by making a joke about the aunt's age and mentions their own health insurance concerns while under the influence. The mom and grandma then stop talking to the author for the rest of the party.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction is key here. They were under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which might have affected their judgment. The comment about the aunt's age could be seen as dismissive or insensitive, especially in a family setting where such a serious request is being made. However, the author also points out that the great-aunt isn't a significant part of their life, so the emotional connection might be low. \n\nThe financial incentive of $25,000 is another angle. The author is concerned about potential medical debt, which is a valid worry. But bringing up their own state of being high and making a joke about the aunt's age might have come across as disrespectful, even if they were stressed or not themselves. \n\nThe family's reaction is to stop talking to the author, which is hurtful. The author feels bad about the way they reacted but is firm in their decision not to donate. The question is whether the manner of their refusal makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nConsidering the context, the author's response might have been inappropriate, especially given the family dynamics and the seriousness of the request. However, the author's concerns about health insurance and the influence of substances might mitigate some responsibility. The key is whether the response was unnecessarily harsh or dismissive. The joke about the aunt's age seems out of place and could have been hurtful, even if the author was trying to deflect. \n\nSo, while the author isn't to blame for refusing to donate a kidney, their delivery might have been inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether their reaction crossed a line despite their valid reasons for declining.\n"
