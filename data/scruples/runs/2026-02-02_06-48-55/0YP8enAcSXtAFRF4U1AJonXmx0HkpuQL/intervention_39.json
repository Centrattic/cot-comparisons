Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 26-year-old woman at a family party. She's tipsy and high on weed when her mom and grandma ask her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. The aunt is in her late 70s and has been ill on and off. The author responds with a shocked reaction, questions her age, mentions her insurance, and says she's too high for the conversation. Then her grandma walks away, and they don't talk for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about her reaction.\n\nFirst, donating a kidney is a huge decision. It's a major surgery with lifelong implications. The author clearly isn't comfortable with the idea, which is understandable. But the way she reacted might be the issue here. She was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which probably affected her judgment and how she expressed herself. \n\nHer comment about the great-aunt's age (\"isn't she kind of old?\") might come off as insensitive or dismissive. Even if her intention was to question the necessity, the way she phrased it could have been hurtful. The mom's response is defensive, trying to counter with the potential for a longer life. The author then brings up her insurance concerns, which is a valid point, but again, the context of being high and the timing might have made her reaction seem flippant.\n\nThe grandma walking away suggests she was hurt. The author might have unintentionally insulted or minimized the gravity of the situation for the great-aunt. However, the author is not wrong for not wanting to donate her kidney. The pressure to donate, especially from family, can be intense, but the decision is personal and should be made without coercion.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was disrespectful or dismissive. Being under the influence might mitigate some of the blame, but it doesn't excuse being unkind. However, the author did express her concerns, albeit in a less than ideal manner. The family's reaction (not talking to her for the rest of the night) might be more about hurt feelings than the author being entirely in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't the asshole for refusing to donate, but her reaction could have been more considerate. So, is she in the wrong? Maybe partially, but not entirely. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for her reaction. If the options are A (yes) or B (no), I think it's a bit nuanced. She wasn't respectful, but her stance on donating isn't wrong. However, the way she handled the conversation was poor. So maybe she's partially at fault. But the answer options are A or B. If the community usually leans towards B in such cases where the person's core decision isn't wrong, even if their reaction was poor, then B. But if the reaction is considered wrong regardless, then A. Given the context, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the main issue is the reaction, not the refusal. But some might argue the reaction was wrong. However, the author is clearly not the asshole for not donating. So the answer might be B.\n"
