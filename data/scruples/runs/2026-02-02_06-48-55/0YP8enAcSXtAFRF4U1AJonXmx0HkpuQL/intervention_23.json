Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked for a kidney donation.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had just smoked weed. Their grandma and mom approached to ask if they'd consider donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was surprised and responded with a sarcastic comment about the aunt's age and mentioned their financial concerns. The grandma walked away upset, and the author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's reaction was inappropriate. The author's defense is that they were under the influence and not in a good state for such a serious conversation. They also mention that the great-aunt isn't a close part of their life. They refused to donate, which is their right, but are they wrong for how they reacted?\n\nThe author's response included being dismissive (\"isn't she kind of old?\"), which might come off as flippant. They also mentioned their insurance issues, which is a valid concern. However, the way they brought it up, especially when under the influence and in a social setting with family, could be seen as disrespectful. The grandmother was hurt, which is important to consider. The author's mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night, showing the impact of their words.\n\nBut on the other hand, the family approached the author in a casual conversation without considering their state. The author might not feel comfortable making such a decision under those circumstances. Also, the financial aspect is a real concern, and the author is not obligated to donate a kidney, so expressing that concern isn't wrong. However, the tone and timing might be the issue here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author isn't wrong for refusing the donation, the way they handled the conversation might have been poor. Being under the influence and using that as an excuse could reduce their accountability. The author's reaction was abrupt and possibly hurtful, especially since the grandmother was directly involved. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their response, not just the refusal.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's state of mind, the context of the conversation, the validity of their concerns, and the emotional impact on family members. It seems like the author's reaction was inappropriate given the circumstances, so they might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
