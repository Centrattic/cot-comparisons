Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which is a big decision. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened, which is important because being in a compromised mental state might affect how they responded.\n\nFirst, the author reacted with a somewhat flippant comment about the aunt's age. That could come off as insensitive, especially since the grandma took it as a personal slight and walked away. The mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night, which shows the impact of the comment. The author later acknowledges that they were not in the right state of mind, which might mitigate some of the blame, but not all.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the conversation and the appropriateness of the response. The author could have handled the situation better by being more respectful and not making a joke about the aunt's age. Even if they didn't want to donate, the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. However, the fact that they were under the influence and later apologized by not engaging further might reduce their fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's approach of bringing up such a serious request during a party and while the author was impaired could be problematic. They might have been insensitive in how and when they made the request. But the question is specifically about the author's reaction.\n\nSo, the author's comment about the aunt's age was inappropriate. They should have handled it with more compassion, even if they were under the influence. The financial compensation part (25k) might have been a factor, but the author's reaction wasn't just about money. The grandma's hurt feelings are valid, and the author's response contributed to that.\n\nTherefore, the author is somewhat at fault for the way they reacted, even if the request itself was unreasonable. The right answer would be A.\n"
