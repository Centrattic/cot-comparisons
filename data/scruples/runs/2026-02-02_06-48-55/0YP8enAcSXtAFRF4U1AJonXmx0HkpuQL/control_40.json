Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is at fault for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The situation involves being under the influence of alcohol and weed during a family conversation. \n\nFirst, the author was in a social setting where substance use is normalized. They were tipsy and had just used a dab rig, which probably affected their judgment and ability to engage in a serious conversation. The family members brought up the request in a casual party setting, which isn't ideal for such a significant and life-altering decision.\n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their own health insurance concerns. They also admitted they were too high to handle the conversation properly. The grandmother then walked away, leading to a tense night.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The family is asking for a kidney donation, which is a major medical decision. The fact that they offered $25k raises some ethical flags because selling organs is illegal in most places, which could indicate some coercion or misunderstanding. However, the author's right to refuse is absolute. They are not obligated to donate an organ, especially without proper consideration.\n\nThe key points are: the author was under the influence, which might have led to a less-than-ideal reaction, but the family brought up the topic inappropriately during a party. The author's response included valid concerns (health insurance, personal state), and they clearly stated their refusal. The grandmother walking away suggests the conversation was handled poorly, but the author's right to say no is protected.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might feel guilty for the way they reacted, but given the context\u2014being impaired, the sudden and serious request in a social setting\u2014it's more about the family's approach being inconsiderate. The author's right to refuse and their honesty about their state (being high) are on their side. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
