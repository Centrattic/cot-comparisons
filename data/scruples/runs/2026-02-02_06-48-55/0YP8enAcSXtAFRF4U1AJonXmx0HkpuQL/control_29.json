Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is at fault here. The situation is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt and reacting in a way that caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had taken weed. They weren't in a clear state of mind. The grandma brought up the donation request out of the blue. The author responded with shock and practical concerns, which might have come off as dismissive or insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the author's state of mind when the conversation happened. Being under the influence could have affected their judgment and how they communicated. Also, the offer of $25k might have been a factor in the family's approach, but the author's response focused on their own health insurance issues and the inappropriateness of the timing.\n\nThe author's reaction included a comment about the aunt's age and their own readiness, which might have been blunt. However, considering they were under the influence, maybe their reaction wasn't malicious. The fact that they later felt bad about the way they reacted suggests some self-awareness.\n\nThe family members stopped talking to them for the rest of the night, which indicates the conversation was hurtful. But was the author wrong to say no? Not necessarily. The issue is the manner of the refusal. Being under the influence might mitigate the bluntness but doesn't excuse all of it. However, the author did express valid concerns about health insurance and their state of mind. \n\nThe grandma's reaction of walking away might have been harsh, but the author's response could have been more empathetic. Still, the core issue is the request itself. The author isn't obligated to donate, especially with the financial incentives involved. The real question is whether their reaction was unkind or dismissive. Given the circumstances, maybe the author is not entirely at fault, but there's room for improvement in how they communicated their refusal.\n"
