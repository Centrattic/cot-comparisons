Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt and reacting poorly while high.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and the conversation about kidney donation came up. The author made a dismissive comment about the aunt's age and mentioned their insurance issues, then said they were too high for the conversation. The grandma was upset and walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nThe author is questioning if their reaction was wrong, even though they don't want to donate the kidney. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author was under the influence, which might affect their judgment and tone. The request for an organ donation is a serious matter, and the author's response was flippant. However, the author has the right to refuse donation. The issue is how they reacted.\n\nIn AITA stories, the community often looks at intent and context. Being high might mitigate some responsibility, but the author was aware they were in that state. The grandma was hurt, but the author's right to say no is important. The $25k payment might also be a red flag, as organ donation should be voluntary without financial incentives.\n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong for refusing, the way they handled it\u2014being dismissive and using a high state as an excuse\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the main wrong here might be the family's approach, pressuring someone for a serious decision in a social setting while they were impaired. The author's response, while not ideal, might be a reaction to inappropriate pressure. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
