Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the context: the author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and was not in the right mindset for a serious conversation. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney, offering $25k. The author's response was a bit flippant, making a joke about the aunt's age and their own health insurance, and mentioning being high. The mom and grandma were upset and didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the factors. Kidney donation is a major decision. The author was under the influence, which might have affected their ability to have a serious discussion. They were not in a good mental state. Their response, while maybe not respectful, was partly due to being high and not in the right frame of mind. However, the grandma initiated the conversation, and the author was honest about their feelings. The money part is also a red flag because they're offering compensation, which might indicate they're not approaching this the right way. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the family shouldn't pressure someone into donating an organ, especially with money involved. The author's refusal isn't wrong because organ donation is a personal choice. The way they reacted might have been inappropriate due to the tone, but given the context (being high and the family's approach), maybe it's understandable. The key points are the author's state at the time and the ethical implications of the family's request. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate, and their reaction can be excused given the circumstances. So, the answer should be B.\n"
