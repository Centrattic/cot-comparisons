Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a family member asking them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to the great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with shock and concerns about their insurance and the appropriateness of the conversation given their state. Then the grandma walked away, leading the author to feel like they upset her. The author is questioning if their reaction was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author was under the influence, the request was made in a casual setting, the author expressed their concerns, and the family was upset by the response.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms. Kidney donation is a major decision with health risks. It's important that such a discussion is thorough and respectful. The author was not in a clear state of mind, which might not be the best time for making such a decision. But the question is about the reaction, not the decision itself.\n\nThe author's response was a bit blunt, like \"isn't she kind of old?\" which might come off as insensitive. However, the author was under the influence and might not have been thinking straight. They did express valid concerns about health insurance. The grandma walked away, which shows she was hurt, but was the author's reaction the issue?\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to be cautious about a life-altering decision. Financial compensation for organ donation is tricky and might not be legal, but that's another issue. On the other hand, the way they reacted, maybe in a dismissive or flippant manner, could be seen as disrespectful, especially to the grandma who might be genuinely concerned about her relative. The author's admission that they were high and not in the right state suggests they might not have intended to be rude but were just caught off guard.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the reaction was perhaps not the best, but given the circumstances (being under the influence, unexpected request) it's understandable. The key is whether the reaction was unkind or inconsiderate. The author's statement about their insurance is a valid point, but the first part about the aunt's age could be seen as insensitive. However, the grandma walked away, which might be overreacting too. \n\nThe author isn't the asshole for not donating, but they might feel their reaction was harsh. The question is whether their response was wrong. Since they were influenced by drugs and the conversation was sudden, maybe the answer is no. But the way they phrased the question about the aunt's age could be a problem. Still, the family's approach of asking for a donation in a party and offering money might not be the best either. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
