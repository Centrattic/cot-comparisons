Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, offering $25k. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction: she was shocked and said something like \"isn't she kind of old?\" which might come off as dismissive or insensitive. Her mom responded by saying the aunt isn't that old and could live longer with a new kidney. Then the author mentioned her health insurance being bad and that she's too high for the conversation. Her grandma walked away, and the moms didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about how she reacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was not in a clear state of mind (tipsy and high), the conversation was unexpected and possibly too serious given her state. She was asked to donate an organ, which is a huge decision. The author didn't say no outright but responded with confusion and some sarcasm. The grandma took offense and left, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider. Being under the influence might have affected her judgment and how she communicated. However, the initial request was a big ask, and she had the right to be hesitant. Her response about the age could be seen as insensitive, but maybe she was just processing the shock. The part about her insurance is a valid concern, but bringing up being high might not have been the best approach. \n\nThe grandma walking away suggests she was hurt or upset. The author's tone and timing might have been inappropriate. However, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her reaction was disrespectful or dismissive. The author's response was direct but not necessarily cruel. She was honest about her state and her concerns. \n\nIn similar situations, people might react differently. If the author had been sober, maybe she would have handled it better. But given the context, her reaction might not be entirely her fault. The family might have handled the request more sensitively. The author is not at fault for refusing to donate, but the way she reacted could have been more respectful to avoid hurting their feelings. However, considering the circumstances (under the influence, unexpected request), it's debatable. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at intent and impact. The intent here might have been to express confusion and concerns, but the impact was hurt feelings. The author could have handled it better, but it's not entirely her fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the main issue was the unexpected request and her state at the time.\n"
