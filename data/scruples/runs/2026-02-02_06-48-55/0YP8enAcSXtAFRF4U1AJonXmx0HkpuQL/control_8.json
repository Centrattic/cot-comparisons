Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for their reaction to being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had just used weed. The mom and grandma brought up the great-aunt's illness and asked the author to donate a kidney, offering $25k. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their insurance concerns, and also that they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the author now feels bad about their reaction.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author was under the influence, which might have affected their judgment. The request was unexpected and serious, and the author responded in a way that might have been dismissive or flippant. But they also raised valid concerns about their own financial situation and health insurance. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The fact that the author was under the influence at the time probably isn't the best context for such a serious conversation. However, the request was made in a social setting, not a formal medical one. The author's response was honest, even if it came off as rude. They mentioned their insurance issues and that they were too high to discuss it, which is a valid point. However, the tone might have been a problem. The grandma taking offense and walking away suggests that the author's response was hurtful. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? They have the right to refuse to donate an organ. The way they reacted might not be the best, but is that their fault? The situation is complex. The family might have approached it in a way that was sudden and without considering the author's state. The author's response was direct, but maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. However, considering the context (party, under the influence), maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe key here is whether refusing to donate a kidney is something that makes the author an asshole. The community often frowns on people being forced to donate organs, especially when there's a financial incentive involved. The author's refusal is acceptable, but the manner in which they refused might have been inappropriate. However, given their state at the time, it's possible they were just being honest about their inability to engage in a serious discussion. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting a party with a serious conversation while someone is under the influence might be the family's fault. The author's reaction, while maybe not the most respectful, is a reaction to being put on the spot in an inconsiderate manner. The $25k payment also raises ethical questions, as organ sales are illegal in many places. The author's insurance concerns are valid, as medical costs can be prohibitive. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate a kidney. They have the right to prioritize their own health and financial stability. The way they reacted might be seen as unkind, but given the circumstances (tipsy, sudden request, lack of proper context), it's not entirely their fault. The family should have approached the topic more sensitively and at a more appropriate time. Therefore, the answer is B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
