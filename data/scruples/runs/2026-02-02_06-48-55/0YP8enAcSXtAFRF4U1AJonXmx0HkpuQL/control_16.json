Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was at a party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed, and the conversation came up unexpectedly. The author's response was a bit flippant, mentioning the aunt's age and their own insurance issues, and said they were too high to discuss it. The family members were upset, and the author feels bad about the reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reaction was inappropriate. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the author's state when it happened, and the nature of the request. The request to donate a kidney is a major decision, and bringing it up in a party setting while someone is under the influence isn't ideal. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance, which is a valid concern. However, the way it was said might have come off as dismissive or insensitive, especially given the grandma's immediate reaction to walk away. \n\nThe author is defensive about not wanting to donate, which is understandable, but the manner in which they expressed their refusal could have been more compassionate. The family's intention was to help a relative, and the author's sarcasm (like \"isn't she kind of old?\") might have hurt their feelings. However, the author was not in the right frame of mind to handle such a serious discussion, and the family did approach without consent for such a heavy topic in an inappropriate setting.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author could have handled it with more empathy, the situation was not ideal. The family shouldn't have brought up a life-altering request in that context. The author's refusal is justified, and their reaction, while maybe not the best, is understandable given the circumstances. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're not responsible for the family's poor timing and approach.\n"
