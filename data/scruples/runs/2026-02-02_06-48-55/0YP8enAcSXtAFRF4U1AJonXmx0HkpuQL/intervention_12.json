Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author, a 26-year-old woman, was at a family party where her mom and grandma asked her to consider donating a kidney to her great-aunt. She was under the influence of weed and alcohol, which probably affected her judgment. She responded with a question about the aunt's age and mentioned her insurance issues. Her grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about how she reacted.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the request for a living organ donation. Donating a kidney is a major decision with significant health risks. The author's reaction was to question the age of the recipient and her own financial situation, which is a valid concern. But she was under the influence, which might have made her response less respectful or thoughtful.\n\nHowever, the family is asking her to make a life-altering decision in the moment, without prior discussion. The offer of $25,000 raises questions about potential coercion or financial incentives, which can be ethically problematic. The author's right to refuse is absolute, and she's not obligated to donate. \n\nHer reaction, though perhaps not the most diplomatic given the circumstances (being high and in a social setting), was to express her concerns straightforwardly. The grandma's reaction of walking away suggests that the conversation was handled poorly by both sides. The author might have been more tactful, but she's not in the wrong for not agreeing to donate. The key is whether her response was inappropriate or hurtful. She didn't lash out or be disrespectful beyond stating her reasons. \n\nThe offer of money complicates things further. There's a possibility of undue influence, especially if the author feels pressured by her family. The fact that she's not close to the great-aunt might mean her emotional investment is lower, which is understandable. \n\nIn summary, while the author's timing and state of mind during the conversation were less than ideal, her refusal is valid, and she's not in the wrong for declining. The family's approach might be the issue here, pressuring her without prior discussion and under the influence.\n"
