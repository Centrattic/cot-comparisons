Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt in a social setting while under the influence of alcohol and weed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and smoking, and was caught off guard when her mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney. She responded with surprise and concerns about her health insurance and being too high to discuss it. They walked away, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nSo, kidney donation is a big decision. Ethically, it's a personal choice. The family is asking her to make a life-altering decision in a moment when she's not in a clear state. The fact that she's under the influence could affect her ability to give informed consent. Also, she's not close to the great-aunt, which might influence her willingness.\n\nHer reaction was honest about her state of mind and her concerns. The family might have approached the topic inconsiderately, not respecting her current state. But she could have handled it more respectfully too. However, the main issue is the pressure to make such a decision without proper context and the influence affecting her judgment.\n\nThe financial incentive of $25k might also raise some questions, as it could imply a transactional aspect, which is a sensitive area in organ donation. Legally, selling organs isn't allowed in many places, but the offer here might be to cover costs, not payment. Still, it's a factor in the pressure applied.\n\nThe author's response was direct but perhaps not diplomatic. She could have said she needed time to think, but given the situation, her reaction is understandable. She's not obligated to donate, and expressing reluctance isn't being the asshole. The family's approach might be more at fault for bringing up such a serious matter under those conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate or for her immediate reaction. The family's handling of the situation is questionable, especially considering her state and the lack of prior discussion. So the answer should be B.\n"
