Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which they declined in a possibly inappropriate manner while under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had smoked weed shortly before the conversation. That might affect their judgment and how they responded. The request came as a surprise, and the author was caught off guard, leading to a shocked reaction. They mentioned their health insurance concerns, which is a valid point, and also said they weren't in the right state to discuss it. \n\nThe author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and mention their insurance issues. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the way they reacted. The key here is whether the author's reaction was inappropriate, not the decision to decline the donation itself.\n\nThe family's approach might be questionable too. Asking someone to donate an organ is a huge request, especially without prior discussion. The offer of money could be seen as a bribe, which might be ethically problematic. The author's refusal is understandable, but the way they expressed it might have been blunt or dismissive.\n\nConsidering the author's state at the time (under the influence), their response may not have been their best. However, the situation is complex. The author is not obligated to donate an organ, and their concerns about health insurance are valid. The grandma's reaction to walk away might have been emotional, but the author's response was factual and perhaps a bit flippant given the context.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and context. The author didn't intend to be disrespectful, but their reaction might have come off as such. However, the family's approach was also inconsiderate. So, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether their reaction was unkind or if the family overstepped. Given the circumstances, it might be a shared responsibility. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the author's response was indeed inappropriate despite the situation.\n"
