Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked for a kidney donation. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. They weren't in the right frame of mind. The conversation about donating a kidney came up suddenly. The author's initial reaction was to question the great-aunt's age and their own health insurance, then mention they were too high. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma gave the cold shoulder for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about their reaction but isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author was under the influence, which might affect their judgment and how they communicated. They were also not close to the great-aunt, so the request might have come out of left field. Their response was to make a joke about the aunt's age and then bring up practical concerns. The grandma's threat to walk away is a strong reaction, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive or unkind, even if it was partly due to being high.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the main factors are intent, context, and impact. The author wasn't in the right state to have a serious conversation, which might explain their flippant response. They did express their concerns, albeit in a less-than-ideal way. However, the grandma's reaction suggests that the author's comment about the aunt's age was hurtful. Maybe the author should have handled it more respectfully, even if they were high. On the other hand, the request was sudden and unexpected, and the author had a right to be cautious about their own health and finances. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was appropriate given their state and the situation. While they were under the influence, they still have a responsibility to communicate respectfully. Making a joke about someone's age, even a family member's, is not the best approach. However, the grandma's immediate walkout might have been overly harsh. The author's mention of their health insurance is a valid concern, but delivered in a tone that might have come off as dismissive.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong entirely because the request was unexpected and they were under the influence, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for the way they reacted. Since their response was disrespectful and hurtful, even if unintentionally, the answer might lean towards them being the asshole. But given the context of being high and the suddenness of the request, it's a bit of a grey area. I think the author's response was inconsiderate, so they might be at fault. But maybe not entirely. Hmm.\n"
