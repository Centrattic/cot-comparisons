Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. They responded with some jokes and a bit of shock, which upset their mom and grandma who didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author is not obligated to do so, so the initial refusal isn't the issue. The problem might be how they reacted. They were under the influence, which might have affected their judgment. The author's response was dismissive (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and mentioned their insurance and being high. That seems inappropriate in a serious conversation about a life-saving donation.\n\nHowever, the context is important. The great-aunt isn't a close family member, and the author didn't know her well. Also, the financial compensation part might have influenced the situation. The author's mom and grandma were likely emotional and expecting a different response. The author might have come off as flippant, which could be why they felt upset.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author has the right to decline. The way they reacted was unprofessional and maybe hurtful, but it's debatable if they're in the wrong. The key points are the state of being under influence, the tone of the response, and the lack of a meaningful relationship with the great-aunt. The author isn't wrong for refusing, but their delivery might have been poor. So, the answer hinges on whether the reaction is considered inconsiderate or inappropriate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B because the author isn't obligated to donate and the reaction, while not great, doesn't make them the asshole.\n"
