Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt in a social setting where they were under the influence of alcohol and weed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using marijuana, and was approached by their mom and grandma about donating a kidney. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their insurance concerns, plus they said they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the author is now worried about their reaction.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should start by analyzing the context. The author was in a state where they weren't sober, which affects their judgment and ability to have a serious conversation. Their response was direct but perhaps not the most diplomatic. However, the decision to donate an organ is a major one, and it's important that the person is in a clear state of mind. \n\nThe family's approach might be seen as putting pressure on the author during a social event, especially when the author wasn't in a good mental state. The author's reaction of being shocked and making a comment about being too high is understandable given the situation. While the way they responded could have been handled more gracefully, the core issue is the organ donation decision, which is their right to refuse. \n\nAlso, the author's concerns about health insurance are valid. Donating a kidney can have financial implications, and the offer of $25k might be seen as a transactional element, which could complicate matters. The author's right to refuse without feeling pressured is important here. \n\nThe grandma's reaction was to walk away, which indicates that the conversation was taken seriously but perhaps not in the right context. The author might feel bad for not being more composed, but their state of mind was impaired. \n\nSo, while the author's response could have been more considerate, they were under the influence and the situation wasn't appropriate for such a serious discussion. The family might have approached the topic in a way that wasn't respectful of the author's current condition. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to refuse and their response, though perhaps blunt, was under the influence and not meant to be disrespectful. The main issue is the organ donation decision, which is the author's personal choice, and the manner of the conversation was not ideal. So the answer is B (No).\n"
