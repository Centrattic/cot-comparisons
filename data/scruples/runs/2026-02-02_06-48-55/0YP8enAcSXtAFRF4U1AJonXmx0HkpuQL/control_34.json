Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation involves the author being under the influence of weed and alcohol, which might affect their judgment.\n\nFirst, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author had the right to be hesitant. They mentioned their health insurance concerns, which is a valid point. No one should be pressured into such a major surgery without proper consideration.\n\nThe family members brought up the request in a social setting where the author wasn't in the right state of mind. Being tipsy and high isn't the best time for serious conversations, especially about organ donation. The author's reaction was honest about their current state, which shows they were being truthful about not being able to discuss it properly then.\n\nThe grandma walked away, and the mom didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. That seems harsh. The family should have approached the topic more sensitively, perhaps at a better time when the author was sober and could think clearly. Pressuring someone in that state might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the financial incentive of $25,000 is a red flag. Organ donation isn't supposed to be bought, and offering money could be unethical or even illegal, depending on the country. The author's hesitation here is justified because accepting such an offer might lead to legal issues.\n\nSo, the author didn't lash out; they were honest about not being in the right frame of mind and their concerns. The family's reaction of ignoring them is more concerning. The author isn't the asshole here. They stood up for their own boundaries and health.\n"
