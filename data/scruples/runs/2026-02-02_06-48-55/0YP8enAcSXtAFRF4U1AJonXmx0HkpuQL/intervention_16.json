Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted to being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had used weed. The conversation came up where their grandma suggested they get tested to donate a kidney. The author responded with some confusion and concern about the aunt's age and their own health insurance. The grandma then walked away, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author was not in the best mental state (under the influence), 2) They reacted with surprise and raised valid concerns about their health and finances, 3) The family members reacted negatively, not engaging further with the author's points.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were under the influence, which might affect their judgment, but it's a common occurrence in their household. The author clearly stated they don't want to donate, which is their right. However, their response might have been dismissive or abrupt. The question is about the \"way\" they reacted, not the decision itself. \n\nThe author's response included a question about the aunt's age, which might be seen as insensitive, but it's a genuine concern. They also mentioned their insurance issues, which is a practical concern. The grandma walking away suggests she was upset, perhaps by the author's tone or the mention of being high. \n\nBut the author was not in the best state for a serious conversation. They might not be at fault for not handling the conversation well under those circumstances. The main issue is whether the reaction was inappropriate. The author's response was direct and honest, albeit maybe blunt. They are allowed to refuse, especially for something so significant. The family's expectation of a kidney donation adds complexity, but the author's right to say no is clear. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong for refusing, and while their reaction could be improved, the core issue is the right to make their own medical decisions. Therefore, Answer B (Not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
