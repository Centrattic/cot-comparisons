Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the writer reacted in a way they're questioning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was tipsy and had used weed, which might have affected their judgment and tone. They were in a social setting, a family party, and the conversation came up suddenly. The great-aunt isn't a close part of their life, and the offer included money, which could be seen as a bit odd since organ donation isn't typically monetized.\n\nThe writer's response was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance issues. They also said they were too high to have the conversation. The family members, especially the grandma, were upset, and the writer is now feeling they might be the asshole for their reaction.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethical aspects. The right to make personal health decisions is important. The writer isn't obligated to donate an organ, even to family. However, the way they reacted could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially in a vulnerable state (under the influence). The grandma walking away suggests she felt hurt or offended.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The writer's state of mind during the conversation (under the influence), 2) The appropriateness of the family's request (asking for a kidney donation with money involved), and 3) The tone and content of the writer's response.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for refusing, but the manner of refusal could be problematic. However, given the circumstances\u2014being under the influence and the family's request being surprising and perhaps insensitive\u2014their reaction might be understandable. The family also didn't approach the topic sensitively. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the context, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the decision to donate is personal, and the family's approach was perhaps not considerate of the writer's state or feelings. The monetary aspect might have also been a factor in the writer's discomfort.\n"
