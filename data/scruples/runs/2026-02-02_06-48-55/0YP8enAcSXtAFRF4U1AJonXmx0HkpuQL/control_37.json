Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is at a family party, a bit tipsy and high from weed. The conversation comes up where the grandmother suggests the author should get tested to donate a kidney to the great-aunt. The author responds with a shocked reaction, questions the aunt's age, mentions their insurance issues, and says they're too high for the conversation. Then the grandma walks away, and the mom and grandma don't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author feels they might be in the wrong for their reaction, not the decision not to donate.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was under the influence, which might have affected their judgment. They reacted with surprise and concern about their own financial situation. The grandma's request was unexpected, and the author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own ability to handle the health costs. The grandma then walked away, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, donating a kidney is a major decision. The author has the right to refuse, but the way they reacted might come across as dismissive or insensitive. However, they were under the influence, which might have made them less composed. They did express concerns about their insurance, which is a valid point. The grandma's reaction of walking away could be seen as abrupt as well. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most diplomatic in the moment, might be understandable given the sudden and serious nature of the request. The fact that the author later reflects on their reaction and feels bad about it suggests they're considering the impact on their family's feelings. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to make their own medical decisions and raised valid concerns. However, the manner of their response could have been more respectful. But given the context of being under the influence and the unexpected nature of the request, it's debatable. The grandma's immediate walkout also shows a lack of empathy for the author's state. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's right to refuse is clear, and while the reaction could have been handled better, they're not entirely in the wrong. The family's approach might also be part of the issue. So the answer is B.\n"
