Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author, a 26-year-old woman, was at a family party where she was asked to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. The request came up when she was tipsy from weed, which she admitted made her not in the right state of mind. She reacted with a comment about the aunt's age and her insurance issues, then said she was too high to discuss it. Her grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about her reaction but isn't sure if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Being under the influence of substances, especially in a social setting, can affect someone's ability to respond appropriately. The author was in a relaxed environment where smoking weed is normal, so maybe the timing of the request was inappropriate. The request was sudden and serious, which can be overwhelming even for someone sober.\n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and her own financial concerns. That seems like a valid reaction because organ donation is a major decision with health risks. Mentioning insurance issues is a practical concern. However, the way she questioned the age (\"isn't she kind of old?\") might come off as dismissive or insensitive, especially if the family is emotionally invested. But given her state at the time, maybe that's understandable.\n\nThe grandma's reaction to walk away could indicate that the author's comment hurt her feelings, but the grandma's action was also abrupt. The author's mom didn't talk to her for the rest of the night, which adds to the tension. The author is questioning if her reaction was too harsh.\n\nLegally, no one can be forced to donate an organ, so the author isn't obligated. Ethically, the family's approach might have been inconsiderate, bringing up a serious request in a casual, possibly inappropriate time and setting. The author's response, while maybe lacking full tact, was a refusal based on personal reasons. The offer of $25,000 could be seen as a bribe, which might pressure someone, but the author is clear she's not doing it regardless.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's reaction was inconsiderate. Being under the influence might have contributed to an awkward response, but she was honest about her unwillingness to donate. The family's approach might have been the bigger problem. The author isn't the one in the wrong here because she's within her rights to refuse, and her reaction, while perhaps not perfect, was a response to an unexpected and heavy request in a social setting where she wasn't prepared to discuss it seriously.\n"
