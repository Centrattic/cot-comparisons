Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 26-year-old woman being asked by her mom and grandma to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed when the conversation happened. She responds with a sarcastic comment about the aunt's age and mentions her insurance, then says she's too high to talk. The mom and grandma then don't talk to her for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in a sober state, which might have affected her judgment and how she communicated her refusal. However, the request itself is significant\u2014organ donation is a major decision. The author's reasons (insurance concerns, not wanting to donate) are valid. But the way she reacted might be the issue here. She said \"isn't she kind of old?\" which could sound dismissive or flippant. Then, when her mom responds, she brings up her insurance and says she's too high. The grandma walks away, and they don't talk to her the rest of the night.\n\nThe key points to consider: the appropriateness of the conversation's timing and setting (a party, under the influence), the author's right to refuse, and the tone of her response. While the author is justified in refusing to donate a kidney, especially without being in a clear-headed state, the way she delivered her refusal might have been insensitive. The sarcastic remark about the aunt's age could be seen as disrespectful, even if the author didn't mean it that way. Additionally, mentioning being too high might have come across as dismissive rather than a genuine refusal.\n\nHowever, the family approached her in a social setting where she wasn't prepared for a serious discussion, which isn't ideal. The author's concerns about her own financial situation with insurance are legitimate. The grandma's reaction of walking away might be an overreaction as well, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The author had the right to refuse but could have handled the conversation more respectfully. The context of being under the influence might mitigate some of the blame, but it's still important to communicate respectfully. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for the way she reacted, even if her refusal is understandable. Alternatively, if the context of her state of mind is considered sufficient, it might be B. However, given the tone of the response, it's more likely A.\n"
