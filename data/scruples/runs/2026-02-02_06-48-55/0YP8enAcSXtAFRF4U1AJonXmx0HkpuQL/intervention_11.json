Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author was at a party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. Their grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with a question about the aunt's age and then mentioned their insurance issues and being high. The mom and grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the reaction.\n\nNow, considering the situation. Kidney donation is a serious decision. The author wasn't in a good state (under the influence) to make such a decision. They also expressed valid concerns about their health insurance, which is a real-world issue. The grandmother's approach might have been abrupt, bringing it up in a social setting where the author wasn't prepared. The author's response was honest but maybe not the best in terms of tone. However, the pressure on the person to make such a life-changing decision in a casual setting, especially when impaired, can be seen as inappropriate. The family might have handled it differently. The author's reaction, while maybe not the smoothest, was in response to a sudden and unexpected request. The payment aspect also raises questions\u2014paying someone to donate an organ is problematic, as it's not a typical transaction. So, while the author could have been more polite, the family's approach was also questionable. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
