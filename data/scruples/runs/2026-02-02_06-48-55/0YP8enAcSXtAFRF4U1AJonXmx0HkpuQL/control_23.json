Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. Her mom and grandma brought up the idea of her donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responds with surprise, mentions the aunt's age, questions the insurance issues, and says she's too high to discuss it. The grandma walks away, and the author feels like they messed up.\n\nSo, the key points here. Kidney donation is a big decision. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which is probably not the best state to have a serious conversation about organ donation. The family approached her in a social setting, not a private, calm environment. The author's response was direct but maybe not the most tactful. They made a joke about the aunt's age, which might come off as dismissive. Then they mentioned their insurance concerns, which is a valid point but maybe not the best way to phrase it in the moment. Also, the grandma walking away suggests that the conversation was hurtful.\n\nBut, the author is not obligated to donate a kidney. The offer of money might be a red flag, as organ selling is illegal in many places. So the family's approach could be problematic. The author's main issue is whether their reaction was inconsiderate, not the decision not to donate. The author is questioning if they were too harsh in their response.\n\nIn terms of social norms, bringing up such a request in a party setting, especially when someone is under the influence, is not appropriate. The family should have had a more private and serious conversation. The author's response was honest but maybe lacked empathy for the family's emotional state. However, given the context of the situation (under the influence, public setting), maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. They are not in the wrong for not wanting to donate, but perhaps their delivery was off. But since the user is asking if the author is the asshole for the reaction, the answer hinges on whether the reaction was unkind or inconsiderate.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They were in a compromised state and had a right to express their discomfort. The family's approach was also inappropriate. So the answer would be B, not wrong.\n"
