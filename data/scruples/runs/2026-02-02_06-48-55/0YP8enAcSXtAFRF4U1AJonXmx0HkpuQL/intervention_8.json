Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The situation involves the author being tipsy and high when the request was made.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. They were not in a clear state of mind, which might have affected their ability to respond appropriately. The family members brought up the request unexpectedly, which could catch anyone off guard.\n\nThe author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and mention their health insurance concerns. They also stated they were too high for the conversation. The family members, especially the grandma, were upset and walked away, leading the author to feel guilty about their reaction.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main points are the context of being under the influence and the abruptness of the request. The family might have approached the topic in a way that was sudden and possibly without prior discussion. The author's reaction was direct but perhaps not the most respectful given the family setting and the grandma's feelings.\n\nHowever, the author isn't obligated to donate an organ. They have the right to refuse, especially given the health and financial risks involved. The payment offered might be a factor, but organ donation for money is unethical and against the law in many places. \n\nThe way the author responded was perhaps not the best, especially while under the influence and in a social setting where others were present. They could have handled the conversation more thoughtfully, maybe deferring it to a more appropriate time when everyone was sober and the matter could be discussed seriously. So, while the author isn't wrong for refusing, the manner of their reaction might be considered inappropriate given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong for the reaction, but there are mitigating factors.\n"
