Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a 26-year-old woman who was asked to donate a kidney to her great-aunt by her mom and grandma during a family party. She was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected her judgment. Her initial reaction was to question her great-aunt's age and express concerns about her insurance. Then her grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. The author is worried she was too harsh in her response.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author was not in a clear state of mind when the conversation started. She was tipsy and had just used weed. This might have led to a less-than-ideal reaction. However, the request to donate a kidney is a big deal. The offer of $25k might be a red flag, as organ donation is not supposed to be sold in the US. The author's concerns about her health insurance and financial burden are valid. \n\nThe main question is whether her reaction was wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for declining to donate, but the way she reacted\u2014being dismissive (\"isn't she kind of old?\"), making a joke about being high, and not handling the conversation with more care\u2014could have hurt her family's feelings. However, considering her state at the time and the suddenness of the request, her response might be understandable. The grandma's reaction of walking away suggests that the approach was off. \n\nLegally and ethically, she's not required to donate an organ, and her concerns about health insurance are valid. The family's approach might have been inappropriate, especially given the monetary incentive, which is against the law. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the best in terms of sensitivity, is not necessarily \"wrong\" because she's not obligated to agree. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to donate and her response, while maybe tactless, was in a compromised state. However, some might argue she could have been more respectful. But given the context, B seems correct.\n"
