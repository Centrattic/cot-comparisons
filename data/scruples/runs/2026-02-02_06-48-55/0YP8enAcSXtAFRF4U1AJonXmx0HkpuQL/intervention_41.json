Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for reacting the way they did when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The situation involves them being under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected their judgment. \n\nFirst, donating a kidney is a big decision. It's a serious medical procedure with risks. The person isn't close to the great-aunt, so maybe they didn't feel a strong obligation. The offer of $25k is there, but that's probably for the donation, which might not cover all potential costs like post-surgical complications. The person expressed concerns about their insurance and financial risks, which are valid.\n\nThe reaction itself: they were shocked, made a comment about the aunt's age, and mentioned being too high. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them the rest of the night. The user is wondering if they were in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of being under the influence, the validity of their concerns, and how they communicated them. When you're high and drunk, it's not the best time for such a serious conversation. The user's response might have come off as dismissive or flippant, especially the \"isn't she kind of old?\" line. That could have been hurtful. However, their concerns about health insurance and financial burden are legitimate reasons to refuse. \n\nBut the way they reacted\u2014being unprepared, maybe not taking the conversation seriously\u2014could be seen as disrespectful, especially to family members who are advocating for a relative's health. The grandma walked away, indicating she was upset. The user is now feeling bad about the reaction, acknowledging that they didn't handle it well, even if their decision is justified.\n\nSo, the question is whether the reaction was in the wrong. On one hand, the user has a right to say no, but the manner in which they did so might have been inappropriate. The answer would depend on whether the reaction was disrespectful versus just stating their position. Since they were under the influence, maybe they didn't come across as serious or empathetic. The \"isn't she kind of old?\" comment might have been insensitive. \n\nBut the user is also in their right to have concerns. So, maybe the wrong isn't about the decision to refuse but the way they communicated it. The user might be in the wrong for the reaction, especially since they were under the influence and made a flippant comment. However, others might argue that the family shouldn't have brought up such a serious topic while the person was high. \n\nI think the answer is that the person isn't in the wrong for refusing, but their reaction was inappropriate. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but maybe with reservations. However, the user is asking if they're in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B. Given the context, the main issue is the reaction's appropriateness, not the refusal itself. So the answer is B.\n"
