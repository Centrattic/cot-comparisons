Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for their reaction when the family asked them to donate a kidney. The story says the author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed, which they mention is normal at their house. The grandma brought up the idea of the author donating a kidney to their great-aunt, offering $25,000. The author responded with a question about the aunt's age and their own insurance concerns, then said they were too high to discuss it. The grandma walked away, and the author felt they upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author wasn't in a sober state when the conversation happened. They were tipsy and on weed. That might affect their judgment and how they responded. But even if they were under the influence, is their response justifiable?\n\nThe author is 26, and the great-aunt is in her late 70s. The author doesn't have a close relationship with her, just occasional interactions. The financial incentive is $25,000. The author's main points were about the aunt's age and their own insurance, which are valid concerns. Organ donation is a big decision with long-term health implications. But the way they reacted might have been dismissive or rude, especially mentioning being too high. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting to donate? Probably not, since it's their body and personal choice. But the question is about the way they reacted. The grandma might have felt hurt by the author's tone and comments about being high. The author could have handled it more sensitively, like expressing willingness to discuss it when they're sober and more composed. However, the grandma and mom brought up the topic in a social setting when the author was not in the right mental state, which could be considered insensitive. \n\nThe author's response, while maybe blunt, was honest. They might not have meant to be disrespectful but were caught off guard. It's possible that the grandma took offense to the comment about her age and the author's state. But the offer of money raises some red flags\u2014organ donation should be voluntary, not financial. The family's approach might have been inappropriate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had a right to refuse and bring up their concerns, but the timing and tone could have been better. The family might have approached the topic more sensitively. However, the author's main argument is about their own health and the situation, not about being rude. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't the asshole for not wanting to donate and expressing their concerns, even if the method wasn't perfect. The family's approach was also questionable, especially with the financial incentive and bringing it up in a casual setting while the author was under the influence.\n"
