Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was tipsy and had smoked weed, which might have affected their judgment. They responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance, which upset their mom and grandma.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they didn't want to donate a kidney, which is their right. The question is about the manner of their response. The author's initial reaction was a bit flippant (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and then they mentioned their health insurance concerns. The mom and grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the way they handled it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key factors here are the context of the conversation (casual party, author under the influence), the appropriateness of the comment about age, and the valid insurance concern. \n\nThe author's comment about the aunt's age could come off as insensitive, even if it was a joke. However, they were under the influence, which might have made them less aware of the impact. The insurance concern is a real issue, and they did address it. The grandma walked away, so maybe the author could have been more diplomatic, but considering their state, maybe it's understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, bringing up age in a medical context isn't appropriate, and the author might have been dismissive. But the main issue is the family's request for a major organ donation, which is a big decision. The author's right to say no is absolute, but the way they said it might have been hurtful. However, given the context (under the influence, valid concerns raised), maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author has a right to refuse, and while the delivery was poor, the context of being under the influence and the gravity of the request matters. The family's reaction was also harsh, so maybe the author isn't the asshole here. But there's a middle ground where they could have been more tactful. Still, the main wrong would be in refusing, which they aren't, so the answer is B.\n"
