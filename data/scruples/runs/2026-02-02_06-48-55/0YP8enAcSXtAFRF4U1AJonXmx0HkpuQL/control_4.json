Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt and how they reacted. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had taken some weed. The conversation came up, and they responded with shock and some comments. The main question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was not in a clear state of mind, which is important. They were high, so their ability to engage in a serious conversation might be compromised. The family asked for a significant sacrifice\u2014donating a kidney. The author didn't say yes, which is understandable, but their reaction might have been abrupt.\n\nThey asked, \"Isn't she kind of old?\" which could come off as insensitive. The mom's response was trying to justify it, saying she could live longer. The author then mentioned their insurance issues and that they were too high. Grandma walked away, and the author felt they upset her. The author is questioning if they handled it poorly.\n\nSo, the key points: being under the influence during a serious discussion, the topic being a major decision, and the response's tone. Under the influence might not excuse poor communication, but it's a factor. However, the author is not obligated to donate a kidney, so their refusal isn't wrong. The question is about the way they reacted.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is an asshole (AITA), so the answer hinges on whether the reaction was inconsiderate. The author was direct, maybe a bit defensive, and the comment about the aunt's age could be seen as flippant. However, considering they were high, maybe they didn't mean to be harsh. The grandma's reaction was to walk away, which could indicate she felt disrespected. The author might have been inconsiderate but isn't in the wrong for refusing. The answer would be B (No), as the author isn't at fault for the reaction given the circumstances, though they could have handled it better. But the key is whether they're in the wrong, not just if their reaction was optimal.\n"
