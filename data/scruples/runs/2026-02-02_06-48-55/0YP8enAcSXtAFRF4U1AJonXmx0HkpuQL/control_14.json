Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy from weed, and the conversation came up. They reacted with shock and some comments that might have seemed dismissive or inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which affected their state of mind. That's a crucial point because it might impair judgment and make the response less measured. However, the offer to donate a kidney is a significant and life-altering decision. The author's reaction included questions about the great-aunt's age and their own financial concerns about health insurance. \n\nThe author's grandma took offense and walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The user is unsure if their reaction was wrong, even though they are clear they don't want to donate a kidney.\n\nLegally, you can't force someone to donate an organ, so the author isn't obligated. Ethically, the question is about how they communicated their refusal. The initial reaction might have been abrupt or insensitive. The comment about the aunt being \"kind of old\" could come off as flippant, especially in a serious health context. Also, mentioning being high at the time might not help the situation, as it could imply they weren't taking the conversation seriously.\n\nHowever, the author did express their position clearly, even if not respectfully. The financial concern about health insurance is valid, as medical costs are a real issue. The fact that the family offered monetary compensation (which is not legal in many places) complicates things further. The author's refusal is understandable, but the manner in which they refused might have been hurtful, especially to family members who were advocating for the great-aunt.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a mix. They have a right to refuse, but the way they handled it could have been more considerate. However, given the context of being under the influence and the suddenness of the request, some might argue they're not at fault. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Given that the user is questioning their reaction's appropriateness despite valid reasons, the answer likely leans towards B, but with a nuance that the approach could have been better.\n"
