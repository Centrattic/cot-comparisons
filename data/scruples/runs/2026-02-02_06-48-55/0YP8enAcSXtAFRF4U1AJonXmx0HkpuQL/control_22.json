Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy from weed. The conversation turned serious when the grandma suggested donating a kidney to a distant relative (great-aunt) and offered $25k. The author responded with hesitation, questioning the aunt's age and their own financial concerns about health insurance. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the way they reacted.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider are the appropriateness of the request, the author's response, and the context of the situation.\n\n1. **Appropriateness of the Request**: Asking someone to donate a kidney is a huge and life-altering decision. It's not something that should be brought up lightly or in a social setting, especially without prior discussion. The financial incentive of $25k might be a red flag, as organ donation is typically not a transactional matter. However, the family might believe they're doing the right thing for their great-aunt.\n\n2. **Author's Response**: The author's reaction was to express confusion and concern. They mentioned their own financial situation and that they weren't in the right state of mind. The first comment about the aunt's age might come off as dismissive, but in context, they're likely expressing genuine hesitation rather than disrespect. The author is clear they don't want to donate, which is their right. \n\n3. **Context of the Situation**: The author was under the influence of weed, which can impair judgment and make it difficult to handle serious conversations. The family introduced a heavy topic in a party setting, which isn't ideal. The author's response, while perhaps blunt, was a reaction to being caught off guard in a state where they couldn't think clearly.\n\n4. **Family's Reaction**: The grandma walked away, indicating upset. However, the author might not have intended to be disrespectful. The financial concerns are valid; medical debt is a real issue, and the author is right to consider their own health insurance limitations.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The author isn't obligated to donate a kidney. Everyone has the right to make their own medical decisions. The family's approach might be seen as pressuring someone in a vulnerable state (tipsy) to make a major decision, which is ethically questionable. The author's refusal is not wrong; the way they expressed it might be seen as rude, but given the context, it's understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key is whether their reaction crossed a line. The author was in a state where they couldn't handle a serious conversation, the topic was introduced unexpectedly, and the response included valid concerns. The comment about the aunt's age could be seen as insensitive, but in context, it's more about the author being overwhelmed. The family's approach was also problematic by bringing up such a heavy topic in a social setting and in a moment when the author wasn't composed.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Their response was a reaction to an inappropriate situation, and they had the right to express their refusal. The family's approach was more at fault here.\n"
