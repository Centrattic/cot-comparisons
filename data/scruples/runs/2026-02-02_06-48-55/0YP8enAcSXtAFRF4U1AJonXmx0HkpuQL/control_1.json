Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had just used weed, which might have affected their judgment. The family members (mom and grandma) brought up the request suddenly, and the author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and mention their own insurance concerns. The grandma then walked away, and the author is wondering if their reaction was inappropriate.\n\nSo, what factors are relevant here? Ethical considerations around organ donation, the appropriateness of the family's conversation timing, the author's state of mind, and the nature of the request (including the money offer). Also, the family's reaction of giving the author the cold shoulder for the rest of the night.\n\nOrgan donation is a big decision, and the author's refusal is understandable. But the way they responded\u2014being sarcastic about the aunt's age and mentioning being high\u2014might be seen as disrespectful or dismissive. However, the family initiated the conversation in a social setting, which might not have been the best time or place. The mention of money ($25k) could also complicate the ethical angle, as it might be seen as a bribe, which isn't typically how organ donations work legally. That could imply that the family was pushing the author for financial reasons, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author's state of mind (tipsy and high) is important too. They were not in a position to make a serious decision, which the family might have exploited. The response about insurance is practical and valid, but the way it was delivered might have been abrupt. However, the author did express that they were too high to discuss it, which shows they recognized the inappropriateness of the conversation's timing.\n\nThe grandma walking away and the mom not talking afterward suggests that the family took offense. But if the request was made in a way that pressured the author without considering their state or prior relationship with the great-aunt, the family might share some responsibility. The author isn't obligated to donate, but the manner of refusal could be seen as hurtful. However, the family's approach was also questionable, especially offering money, which might be against legal guidelines (organ donation for money is illegal in many places). \n\nIn terms of social norms, bringing up such a serious and personal request at a party isn't ideal. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most tactful, is understandable given the circumstances. The key is whether the author's response was inconsiderate. The author did state their position clearly but maybe in a way that was flippant. However, the family's approach was problematic, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the family's request was inappropriate, the author was in a state where they couldn't properly process the request, and the offer of money adds a layer of coercion. The author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a valid reaction to an improper situation.\n"
