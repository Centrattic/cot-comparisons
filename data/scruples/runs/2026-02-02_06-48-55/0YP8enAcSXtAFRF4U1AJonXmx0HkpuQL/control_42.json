Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family party where the author's mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when this happened. She reacted with surprise and concern about her health insurance and the context of being high. Her grandma left the conversation, and they didn't talk to her for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Donating a kidney is a major decision with significant health risks. The author was not in a clear state of mind, which is important because making such a decision while impaired isn't fair to expect from anyone. The fact that they offered $25,000 raises questions about the motivation behind the request. Financial incentives for organ donation are controversial and can be seen as exploitative.\n\nThe author's response included a blunt comment about her relative's age and her own financial concerns. That's understandable given the circumstances. She's not obligated to donate, especially to someone she's not close to. The way she reacted might have been direct, but she was under the influence and clearly uncomfortable. The family's reaction\u2014ignoring her for the rest of the night\u2014seems harsh and counterproductive. The grandma walking away could be seen as abandoning the conversation instead of addressing the concerns.\n\nLegally, in most places, you can't be forced to donate an organ, even to a relative. The offer of money might also be illegal in some jurisdictions, as selling organs is typically prohibited. The author's concerns about health insurance and debt are valid because medical complications can occur, and without good insurance, that's a real risk.\n\nEmotionally, the author might feel guilty for the way she responded, but it's important to recognize that she was in a vulnerable state. The family's approach was abrupt and didn't consider her perspective. They didn't ask for her willingness or ensure she was in a good headspace to discuss such a life-changing decision.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because she was under the influence, the request was unexpected and potentially unethical, and her concerns were reasonable. The family's handling of the situation, especially the lack of support and understanding, is more at fault here.\n"
