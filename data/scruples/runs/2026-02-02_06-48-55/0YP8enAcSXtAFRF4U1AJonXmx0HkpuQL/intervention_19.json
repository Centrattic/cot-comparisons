Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The author was at a party, slightly intoxicated from weed, and when the request came up, they made a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which might have impaired their judgment. They were already in a social setting where substance use is normalized, so maybe the family isn't entirely shocked by the response. The author's comment about the aunt's age could come off as dismissive or insensitive, which might have hurt the grandma's feelings. But the author also raised valid concerns about their own health insurance and financial stability, which are legitimate reasons to be hesitant.\n\nThe grandma walked away, indicating she felt upset. The author is now questioning if their reaction was appropriate. The key here is whether the way they reacted was inconsiderate, regardless of their reasons. The question is about being the \"asshole\" for the manner of their response, not just the content of the message.\n\nThe author did mention feeling too high to have the conversation, which is honest about their state. But the initial comment about the aunt's age might have been flippant. However, considering they were under the influence and the family approached them unexpectedly with such a serious request, their reaction might be more about shock and stress than intentional meanness. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family approached the author unprepared, possibly in a setting where a serious conversation wasn't expected. The author's concerns about health insurance are valid, and the financial incentive of $25k could be seen as a bribe, which is ethically tricky. But the way the author expressed their concerns might have been blunt or insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the asshole for not wanting to donate a kidney. That's a personal choice. The issue is the reaction. The grandma taking offense and walking away suggests the author's manner was hurtful. However, given the context of the author's state and the suddenness of the request, some leniency might be warranted. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were in a compromised state and raised valid points. But they could have handled it more gracefully. However, since the question is whether they're the asshole (AITA), which typically leans towards emotional impact, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted here because the author's state of mind and the circumstances might mitigate the blame. Maybe B is the answer if the reaction isn't seen as malicious.\n"
