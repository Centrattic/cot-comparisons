Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt in exchange for $25,000. The key points here are the context in which the request was made and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana when the conversation happened. They mention being tipsy and having just taken a dab, which is common in their household. This raises the question of whether their impaired state affected their ability to have a serious conversation about such a major decision. However, the fact that they were in a relaxed environment where drug use is normalized might mitigate the judgment against them for being under the influence.\n\nNext, the request was made by the mom and grandma during a family party. The author wasn't close to the great-aunt and had only a casual relationship with her. The financial compensation of $25,000 is mentioned, which could imply that the request wasn't purely altruistic. The author's response was to question the timing and their own health insurance concerns, which are valid points. They also stated they were too high for the conversation, indicating they weren't in the right mental state to discuss such a serious matter.\n\nThe grandma walked away in apparent hurt, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author is conflicted about whether they were in the wrong for their reaction. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, donating a kidney is a significant medical decision with long-term consequences. The fact that the author was under the influence could argue that the conversation wasn't appropriate at that moment. However, the family's approach to bringing up such a serious topic in a casual, possibly inappropriate setting (during a party where the author was high) might also be at fault. The offer of money adds another layer, as it could be seen as a transactional aspect rather than a purely familial request.\n\nThe author's response was direct and honest, pointing out their own limitations and concerns. While the tone might have been abrupt, the content of their response addresses legitimate issues. The question is whether the way they reacted was inconsiderate. However, given the context and the fact that the author was not in a good mental state to discuss the matter, their reaction might be understandable. The family's approach in pressing the issue without considering the circumstances might be the bigger issue here.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's main faults could be not handling the conversation more diplomatically, especially considering the grandmother's feelings. But the family's approach in making such a request in that environment also plays a role. Since the author's response was honest and they were under the influence, it's debatable whether they are entirely at fault. The key here is that the situation was poorly timed and the family's approach was perhaps inconsiderate. The author's reaction, while perhaps blunt, was in response to an unexpected and inappropriate request made in an unsuitable context.\n"
