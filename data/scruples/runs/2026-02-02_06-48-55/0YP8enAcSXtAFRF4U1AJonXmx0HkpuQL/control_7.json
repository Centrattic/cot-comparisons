Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is the asshole for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a family party, was tipsy and had just smoked weed. Her mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to their great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with hesitation, saying the aunt is old and that their insurance is bad. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author is worried they were in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was under the influence (both alcohol and weed), the topic was brought up suddenly in a social setting, the author expressed their concerns but maybe in a blunt way. The grandma took offense and left, leading to a strained evening. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for the way they reacted, not for the decision to not donate.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors would be intent, context, and appropriateness of the response. The author was not in a sober state, which might affect their ability to have a serious conversation. They did express their concerns about health insurance and being too high. However, the initial reaction might have been dismissive or flippant. Saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" could come off as insensitive. The author also mentioned the financial aspect of their own insurance, which is a valid concern but could be seen as putting the responsibility on themselves when the family is asking for a donation. The grandma walked away, indicating she was hurt or upset. The author is concerned about being an asshole for the reaction, not the decision itself.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, donating an organ is a significant decision and should be made carefully. The family bringing up the topic in a social setting without prior discussion might be inappropriate. The author's response, while perhaps not ideal, was expressing their immediate concerns. The use of humor or casual tone (\"isn't she kind of old?\") might have been perceived as disrespectful. However, considering the author's state at the time, it's possible they weren't thinking clearly and their response was more about their own discomfort than malice.\n\nThe financial incentive of $25k might also complicate things, as organ donation should ideally be altruistic. The fact that the family is offering money could be a red flag, and the author's concern about their own insurance is valid. The author's reaction might be seen as justified in part because of the family's approach. However, the way they expressed their refusal could have been more considerate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for refusing to donate, their reaction might have been inappropriate given the context and the emotional impact on their family. They could have handled it better, but the main issue might lie with the family bringing up such a serious topic in an unsuitable setting. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's primary responsibility is to their own health, and the family's approach was flawed. However, there's a nuance here. The answer could depend on cultural expectations and the sensitivity of the topic. Given the author's state and the family's approach, it's possible the author isn't the asshole.\n"
