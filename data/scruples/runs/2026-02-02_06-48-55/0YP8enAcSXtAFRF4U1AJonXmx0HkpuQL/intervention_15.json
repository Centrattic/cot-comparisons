Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which they declined, and the way they reacted.\n\nFirst, the context: the conversation happened during a family party where the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected their judgment. The family's request was sudden and unexpected. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their health insurance issues, then say they were too high to talk. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't speak to them for the rest of the night. The author is now wondering if their reaction was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the state of the author when the conversation happened. Being under the influence might have led to a less-than-ideal response. Also, the author didn't know the great-aunt well, which might affect their willingness to donate. The financial offer of $25k is mentioned, but it's not clear if that's a standard compensation or potentially a factor in the family's approach.\n\nThe author's main defenses would be that they were not in a good state to have a serious conversation and that the topic was unexpected. On the other hand, the way they responded\u2014questioning the aunt's age and insurance issues\u2014might come off as dismissive, especially when the grandma was emotionally hurt. The grandma's reaction of walking away suggests that the author's response was hurtful.\n\nBut considering the circumstances, the author was in a compromised state. They did express their concerns, albeit perhaps bluntly, and the family's approach might be seen as putting pressure on them in a social setting. The offer of money could also be a point of contention, as financial incentives for organ donation are controversial and may not be legally permissible in many places, which might add another layer of ethical issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be at fault for declining the donation, but the manner of their response could be seen as inconsiderate. However, given their state at the time and the suddenness of the request, their reaction isn't entirely unjustified. The question is whether their response was inappropriate. The grandma's walking away might indicate that the author's words were hurtful, but the author might not be fully at fault since they were under the influence and the topic was unexpected.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often considers intent and context. The author's intent was to decline, but their delivery was affected by their state. The family's approach might also be questionable. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author is expected to handle the situation more gracefully despite their state. However, since they were under the influence and not in the right mindset, maybe they aren't at fault.\n"
