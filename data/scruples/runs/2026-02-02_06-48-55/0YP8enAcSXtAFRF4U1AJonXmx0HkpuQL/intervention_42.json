Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which they found surprising and reacted to while under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which might affect their judgment and ability to handle a serious conversation. However, they did try to respond, even if it was maybe not the best way. They mentioned their health insurance concerns and that they were too high to discuss it seriously. \n\nThe family members\u2014mom and grandma\u2014brought up the request during a party without much prior discussion. The author's reaction was to question the great-aunt's age and their own financial situation. The grandma then walked away, and they didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author is now feeling guilty about their reaction.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's reaction was appropriate. Being under the influence could be a mitigating factor, but it's not an excuse for being rude. However, the author did express their discomfort with the situation. The grandmother's reaction was to walk away, which suggests that maybe the author's response wasn't the worst possible. The author also clarified that they were not in a good state for a serious conversation, which might explain their response.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the appropriateness of the timing. The family asked for a major organ donation, which is a significant decision. The author was not in a position to make such a decision at the moment, so pointing that out seems reasonable. However, the way they reacted\u2014saying the aunt is \"kind of old\" and focusing on their insurance\u2014might come off as dismissive or insensitive. \n\nBut considering the circumstances (being under the influence, the suddenness of the request), maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. They did express their concerns and even mentioned they were too high to discuss it. The family's approach might also be questionable\u2014bringing up a kidney donation without prior discussion at a party. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a judgment call. The author's reaction was honest but perhaps not the most tactful. However, given the context, maybe they aren't the asshole. The family might have handled the request better. So, I'm leaning towards B (they are not in the wrong) because their reaction was a response to a sudden, serious request in a relaxed, social setting where they weren't prepared for such a conversation.\n"
