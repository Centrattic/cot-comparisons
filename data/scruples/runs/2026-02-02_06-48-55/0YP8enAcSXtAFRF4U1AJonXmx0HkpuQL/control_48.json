Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had used weed. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney to the great-aunt, offering $25k. The author's response was a bit flippant (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and mentioned their health insurance and being high. The mom and grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author's state of mind (under the influence), the abruptness of the request, the author's response, and the family's reaction.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're the asshole for their reaction, even though they don't want to donate a kidney. The key here is whether the way they reacted was wrong, not the decision to not donate. The question is about the reaction, not the decision itself.\n\nThe author was under the influence, which might have affected their ability to handle the conversation. They were also caught off guard by the sudden request. Their response was a bit dismissive and perhaps not respectful, especially mentioning being high. However, the grandma walked away first, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. \n\nLegally, you can't be forced to donate a kidney, so the author isn't obligated. The offer of money complicates things a bit, as it might be seen as a bribe, but that's another angle. The author's reaction might have been inappropriate given the context of the family gathering and the grandma's intentions, even if the request was sudden and the author was under the influence.\n\nBut the author is more concerned about the way they reacted, not the refusal. So, is it wrong to react with shock and a joke when faced with a sudden, serious request while under the influence? Maybe. The author could have handled it better, but the situation was also unexpected and perhaps the family approached it poorly. The grandma's abruptness might have contributed to the author's flippant response. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being under the influence and making a comment about the person's age might have been disrespectful. However, the author did express their concerns about health insurance, which is a valid point. The grandma walked away first, which indicates that their reaction upset them. \n\nBut the author's primary issue was the manner of the response. Even if the request was sudden, the way they replied might be seen as dismissive or not taking the situation seriously. However, the author is not in the wrong for not wanting to donate, just for how they reacted. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (no), because the author isn't wrong for not wanting to donate, and their reaction, while perhaps not ideal, was in a state of mind impaired by substances. The family might have approached the request in a way that wasn't sensitive, especially in a party setting. The author's right to say no is valid, and the reaction could be a result of the circumstances. So, the author isn't the asshole for their reaction.\n"
