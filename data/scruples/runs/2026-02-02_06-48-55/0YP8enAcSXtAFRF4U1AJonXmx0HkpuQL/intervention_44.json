Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed and reacted with a comment about the aunt's age, then mentioned her health insurance and that she was too high to talk. Now she's feeling like she might be the asshole for reacting that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which might affect her judgment and ability to handle a serious conversation. The family is asking for a major medical commitment\u2014kidney donation\u2014which is a big deal. The author is 26, not in a close relationship with the great-aunt, and the financial incentive is $25k. That's not a typical situation, and the offer of money might be a red flag in itself. \n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age, which could come off as insensitive. But considering she was under the influence, maybe she wasn't thinking clearly. Also, she raised a valid point about her health insurance not being good, which is a real concern. The family didn't take her response well and walked away.\n\nNow, am I supposed to judge if the author was wrong? The key points: the author is not obligated to donate a kidney, especially to a distant relative. However, the way she reacted\u2014making a comment about age and being dismissive\u2014might have been hurtful. But given her state at the time, maybe she's not fully responsible for her reaction. Also, the fact that the family brought up such a serious topic during a party without considering her state of mind is questionable. \n\nThe offer of $25k is also problematic. Kidney donations shouldn't be bought, and that's illegal. So maybe the family's approach was wrong. The author's concerns about her health insurance are valid, and pointing that out isn't wrong. But the initial comment about age could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIn the end, while the author's reaction wasn't perfect, the main issue is the family's pressure and the financial incentive. The author isn't obligated to donate, and her reaction, though perhaps poorly phrased, is understandable given the circumstances and her state. So, maybe she's not the asshole. But I'm a bit torn because the way she responded might have been hurtful, but the situation is complicated.\n"
