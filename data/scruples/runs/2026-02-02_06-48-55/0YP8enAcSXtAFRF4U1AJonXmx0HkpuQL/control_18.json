Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for her reaction to her family asking her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt.\n\nFirst, the situation: She was at a party, a bit tipsy from weed, and her mom and grandma brought up the idea of her donating a kidney. She responded with \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioned her insurance and being high. They walked away, and she feels bad about how she handled it.\n\nSo, the main points here. Kidney donation is a big decision. The author was under the influence, which might have affected her judgment. She was asked to make a life-altering decision in the moment, which isn't fair. The family is pushing her for a significant organ donation without considering her feelings or current state.\n\nThe author's response was blunt and maybe a bit dismissive, like asking about the aunt's age. That could come off as insensitive, but given the circumstances (being high, not in a good place for a serious conversation), her reaction might be understandable. She also raised valid concerns about her insurance, which shows she's thinking about the consequences.\n\nThe family's approach was probably inappropriate. They brought up such a serious topic during a party and in a state where she wasn't sober. They offered money, which adds pressure. The author isn't obligated to donate her kidney, so her refusal isn't unethical. However, the way she responded might have hurt their feelings, but she's not entirely wrong for not wanting to do it.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She wasn't respectful in her tone, but the family should have handled the conversation better. The main issue is the family's pressure and the context of the conversation. The author's response, while maybe not the best, was a reaction to a stressful and inappropriate situation. Therefore, she's not the asshole.\n"
