Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which they refused, and their reaction was considered harsh by some.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That's a key point because it affects their ability to think clearly and respond appropriately. They were in a social setting where substance use is normalized, so maybe that's part of the context.\n\nThe request was made by their mom and grandma. The author's response was a bit flippant, like \"isn't she kind of old?\" and then mentioning their insurance. The grandma walked away upset. The author feels bad about how they reacted, not necessarily the decision to not donate.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a binary answer: A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the author's response was perhaps not respectful. They made a joke about the aunt's age, which could be insensitive, even if they were high. However, they also mentioned valid concerns about their health insurance and the seriousness of the surgery. The grandma walking away suggests that the tone was off-putting. But considering they were under the influence, maybe their judgment was impaired, leading to an inappropriate reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to refuse organ donation. The problem here is the manner of refusal. The question is whether the way they said it was inconsiderate. The author's own self-awareness (\"I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted\") might indicate they recognize the issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a decision to not donate, which is their right, but the way they expressed it was disrespectful. However, the context of being under the influence complicates it. But even under the influence, some level of respect is expected. The grandma's feelings were hurt, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they have a right to refuse. But the main issue is the reaction, not the refusal itself. So leaning towards A.\n"
