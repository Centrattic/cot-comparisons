Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. The conversation came up where their mom and grandma wanted them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with a question about the aunt's age and mentioned their health insurance problems, and also said they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author is now feeling like they might be the asshole for their reaction.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the author's reaction was inappropriate. Let's think about the factors here. First, the context of being under the influence. Being tipsy and high might affect someone's ability to handle a serious conversation. However, the author did respond, even if it was in a lighthearted way. But maybe they were dismissive or uncooperative.\n\nThe grandma brought up the request in the middle of a family conversation. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and then mention their own financial concerns and state of mind. It's possible that the author's tone could have been seen as flippant or disrespectful, especially since the request is a serious medical decision. However, the author did express their refusal but also gave valid reasons. The mom and grandma's reaction was to ignore them, which is also a problem, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not obligated to donate an organ, even to a family member. They have the right to say no. However, the manner in which they said it might have been inconsiderate. The question is whether the way they reacted was wrong. The author's response was direct but perhaps lacked the empathy or consideration for the family's feelings. The grandma walking away shows that the conversation was hurtful. \n\nBut considering the author's state at the time (high and tipsy), maybe they weren't in the right frame of mind to handle such a serious topic. They did mention they were too high, so that's part of their excuse. The key here is whether the reaction was inappropriate given the context. \n\nIn some cultures, family expectations are very strong, and refusing a request like this could be seen as disrespectful. However, in others, individual autonomy is more valued. The author's reasons\u2014health insurance and personal choice\u2014are valid. The payment of $25k seems like a transactional aspect, but organ donation isn't typically monetized, so that might complicate things. The offer of money could be a red flag, as it might be seen as a bribe, which could affect the validity of the donation.\n\nThe author's response might have been too blunt or dismissive, but given their state and the fact that they were not being asked to donate without compensation, they have a right to refuse. The main issue is the manner of refusal. The question is whether the way they said it made them the asshole.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to say no, the way they did it might have been inconsiderate. However, given their state and the valid reasons, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer could be B (no), but there's a nuance. Alternatively, if the response was particularly unkind, the answer might be A. But given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
