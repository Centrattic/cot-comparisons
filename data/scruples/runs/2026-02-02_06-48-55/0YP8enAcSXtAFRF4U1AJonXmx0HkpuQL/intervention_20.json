Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. They were at a party, had been smoking weed, and were tipsy. The grandma brought up the request, and the person responded with shock and made a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance. Then their mom and grandma stopped talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the way they reacted was inappropriate. They were under the influence of weed, which might affect their judgment. But even if they were high, being respectful in serious family matters is important. The author's response was dismissive and maybe a bit flippant, especially the \"isn't she kind of old?\" comment. That could come off as insensitive, especially when someone's health is involved. \n\nThe offer of $25k might also be a factor. Financial incentives for organ donation are controversial, but the family is offering it. The author's concern about health insurance is valid, but bringing that up in the moment might have been the wrong approach. \n\nHowever, the person is 26 and it's their body. They have the right to say no. The way they reacted might not be the best, but does that make them the asshole? The question is about the reaction, not the decision itself. Maybe they could have handled it more politely, even if they were high. But considering the context of being under the influence, perhaps the family should have had a more appropriate time for such a serious conversation. \n\nSo, does the author deserve to be in the wrong? On one hand, the reaction was abrupt and maybe hurtful. On the other, the situation was inappropriate given their state. But in terms of being wrong, maybe they are partly at fault for not responding with more consideration for their grandma's feelings. However, others might argue that the family shouldn't have brought it up in that context. \n\nHmm. I think the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because their response was tactless, even if they were high. But some might say the family is wrong for bringing it up in that setting. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The person's comment about the aunt's age is the main issue here. It's a serious matter, and making a joke or a flippant remark could be seen as insensitive. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
