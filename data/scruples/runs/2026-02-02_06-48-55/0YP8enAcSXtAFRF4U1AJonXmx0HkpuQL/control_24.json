Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which the author says they reacted poorly to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed. The mother and grandmother brought up the topic of the great-aunt needing a kidney. The author felt unprepared for such a serious conversation in that state. They responded by saying the aunt is old and mentioned their own insurance issues. The grandmother walked away, and the author is now worried about being in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider a few factors. First, the context of the situation: the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have impaired their judgment. Second, the suddenness of the request. The author didn't expect such a serious topic in a social setting. Third, the emotional impact of the grandmother walking away. \n\nFamily dynamics play a role here. Sometimes, family members might approach sensitive topics without considering the other person's state. The author's response was honest, pointing out their own health concerns and the impracticality of the conversation in their current state. \n\nHowever, the way the author reacted\u2014saying the aunt is old\u2014might have been perceived as disrespectful. But considering the context (impaired state, lack of prior relationship with the aunt), maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the offer of $25k raises questions. Organ donation is typically not monetized, which might be a red flag. The family's approach seems hasty, expecting a decision in that moment. The author was within their rights to express discomfort and mention practical concerns. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's normal for people to feel overwhelmed by such a request and to need time to process. The author didn't outright refuse with malice but instead pointed out immediate issues. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's reaction was understandable given the circumstances. They were not in a good state to discuss such a serious matter. The family's approach might have been insensitive. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
