Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were at a family party, a bit tipsy from weed, and their mom and grandma asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author reacted with shock and made some comments, leading to their family being upset.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed. That might affect their judgment and how they handled the conversation. But is that a valid excuse for how they reacted? Maybe not. However, it's important to consider their state of mind at the time.\n\nThe author then said, \"Umm... isn't she kind of old?\" which seems like a flippant response. The mom counters that the aunt could live longer with a new kidney. The author then brings up their insurance concerns and mentions being too high for the conversation. The grandma walks away, and the author feels they upset her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider: the author was asked to donate a kidney, a major and irreversible decision. They didn't agree, which is their right. But the way they reacted\u2014being dismissive, making light of the situation, and reacting in a way that upset their family\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the family approached them in a very serious conversation when the author was under the influence. It's possible that the family should have had this conversation in a more appropriate setting. Also, the offer of $25k for a kidney is problematic, as selling organs is illegal in many places. So maybe the family's approach was inappropriate too.\n\nThe author's response, while maybe not the best way to handle it, might be understandable given the unexpected nature of the request and their state. They did express their concerns about their own insurance and the inappropriateness of the timing. The family's reaction could also be part of the issue here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't agree to donate, which is their right. Their reaction, while perhaps not the most respectful, was in part due to being high and the inappropriate timing. The family might have handled it better. So I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
