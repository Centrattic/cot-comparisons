Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after reacting to a request to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation involves a family party where the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed. The grandma suggested the donation, and the author responded with shock and some comments that upset the mom and grandma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was not in a clear state of mind due to substances, which might have affected their ability to engage in a serious conversation. The request is about a significant and irreversible decision\u2014organ donation. The author's response included a question about the aunt's age and concerns about their own health insurance, which seems like a reasonable initial reaction. However, the way they responded might have been abrupt or dismissive, especially the part about being too high to talk. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. I should evaluate whether the author's reaction was inappropriate given the circumstances. Family dynamics play a role here. The great-aunt isn't a close figure in the author's life, so expecting them to make such a sacrifice might be unreasonable. The financial incentive of $25k is also mentioned, which could imply that the family isn't solely motivated by altruism, which might add to the author's hesitation.\n\nThe author's response might have been more about their immediate discomfort and the influence of substances. They didn't outright refuse but expressed confusion and concern. However, the grandma walked away, indicating she felt disrespected. The author might have handled it better by expressing their stance more respectfully, even if they were under the influence. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014being under the influence, the suddenness of the request, and the lack of a close relationship with the great-aunt\u2014it's possible that the family's approach was also flawed. Pressuring someone for such a major decision in a social setting, especially with a non-close family member, could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most tactful, might be justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more diplomatically. Instead of making a comment about being too high, maybe they should have asked for time to think or deferred the conversation. The question is whether the reaction itself was wrong, not just the decision to not donate. The author's honesty about their state and concerns might be valid, but the delivery might have caused unnecessary hurt. \n\nIn the end, the family's approach was possibly inappropriate as well. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If the author's response was dismissive and hurtful without a clear reason (other than their state of mind), then they might be in the wrong. However, if the family's request was unreasonable to begin with, the fault isn't solely on the author.\n"
