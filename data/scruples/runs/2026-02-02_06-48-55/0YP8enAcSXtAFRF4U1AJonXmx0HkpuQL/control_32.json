Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is 26 years old, and their mom and grandma asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The aunt is in her late 70s. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and smoking weed, and wasn't in the best state for a serious conversation. When the grandma brought up the request, the author responded with a joke about the aunt's age and mentioned their insurance issues. Then the grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author the rest of the night.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're the asshole for their reaction. They know they don't want to donate a kidney, but are worried about the way they reacted.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when this conversation happened. That can impair judgment and make someone less able to handle a serious conversation. The request to donate a kidney is a huge decision with major health and financial implications. The fact that it was brought up in a social setting where the author wasn't in the right mind is a problem.\n\nNext, the financial incentive of $25,000 is mentioned. The author points out their insurance is bad, which is a valid concern. Donating an organ can lead to unforeseen medical issues, and without good insurance, the financial burden could be significant. The author is right to be cautious here.\n\nThe author's response was to make a comment about the aunt's age and mention their insurance. The humor might have been off-putting, but given the context, it's understandable as a way to deflect or express discomfort. The grandma's reaction was to walk away, which seems harsh. The mom and grandma didn't speak to the author for the rest of the night, indicating a significant emotional fallout.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had the right to refuse the donation. The problem is whether their response was inappropriate. Being under the influence might have affected their ability to respond calmly. However, they did express their concerns, albeit in a possibly flippant way. The grandma walking away and the subsequent silence from the mom and grandma suggest that the family was upset, but the author's concerns are valid. \n\nThe key points are consent and the appropriateness of the conversation setting. Asking someone to donate an organ is a serious matter that should be discussed when both parties are sober and can have a thoughtful conversation. The author's response was honest, albeit maybe not the most respectful, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say they're entirely at fault. The family's reaction might have been overly harsh. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to donate a kidney, even to a relative. The fact that they were offered money is a red flag, as organ trade is illegal. The offer of $25k could be seen as a way to compensate for the risks, but that's not acceptable in many places. The author is right to be cautious about that. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing, and their reaction, while perhaps not the most tactful, was under the influence and in a stressful situation. The family's reaction seems excessive. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
