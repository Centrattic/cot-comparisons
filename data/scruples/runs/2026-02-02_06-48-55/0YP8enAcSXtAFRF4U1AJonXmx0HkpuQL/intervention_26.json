Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their insurance situation, as well as say they were too high to talk. The mom and grandma took offense, leading to a rift at the party.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That's important because it might affect their judgment and how they communicated. However, the topic being brought up is a serious medical decision. Donating a kidney is a major procedure with lifelong implications. The author didn't say yes, which is their right, but their delivery might have come off as dismissive or flippant.\n\nThe grandma walked away upset, so the author's comment about the aunt's age could be seen as insensitive. Even if the author was high, bringing up someone's age in the context of a potential life-saving donation might not be the best approach. The author's mention of their insurance is a valid concern, but the way they phrased it might have seemed more like an excuse than a genuine concern.\n\nHowever, the author is clearly stating their position and refusing a request that's a big decision. They were also in a state where they weren't at their best, which might mitigate some of the blame. The family's approach of asking for a kidney donation without prior discussion is also questionable, as it's a huge request that needs careful consideration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't commit a crime or do something unethical, but their communication style could have been more respectful. The key is whether the reaction was inappropriate given the circumstances. While the author has valid reasons for not donating, the way they responded could have been more empathetic. But considering their state at the time, maybe it's understandable. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but since the user is asking for A or B, need to decide based on whether the reaction was in the wrong contextually.\n"
