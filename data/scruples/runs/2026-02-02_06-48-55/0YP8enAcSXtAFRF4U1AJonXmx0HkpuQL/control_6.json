Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for their reaction when family members asked them to donate a kidney. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was at a family party, was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which means they weren't in a sober or clear state of mind. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author's response included a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance concerns. The grandma walked away, and the author now feels guilty about the way they reacted.\n\nThe key points here are: the context of the conversation (family party, under the influence), the sudden and serious nature of the request, the author's right to refuse, and the appropriateness of their response.\n\nFirst, the author has the right to say no to donating an organ. It's their body, and they can choose not to donate, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. The financial incentive might also be a red flag, as organ donation shouldn't be monetized. \n\nHowever, the way they reacted: being under the influence might have affected their judgment and response. The comment about the aunt's age could be seen as flippant or dismissive, which might have hurt the grandma's feelings. The author also mentioned their health insurance issues, which is a valid concern, but the tone in which it was presented could be problematic. \n\nThe grandma walking away suggests that the author's reaction was indeed hurtful. The author acknowledges that they might have upset their grandma, which is a sign of empathy. But the question is whether they're at fault for the reaction itself.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't wrong for declining the donation. The issue is the manner of the refusal. However, given the context (intoxicated, not in the right frame of mind), it's understandable that their response wasn't the best. \n\nFamily dynamics play a role here. The request was sprung on the author suddenly, and the author's honest, albeit blunt, response might be justified. The family's expectation that the author should comply without question could be the real issue. The author is not obligated to donate, even for family. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing the donation, and while their reaction could have been more tactful, the circumstances (being under the influence, caught off guard) mitigate some of the blame. The main fault lies in the family's approach to making such a serious request in a social setting, especially with an offer of money, which complicates the situation. So the answer is B (No).\n"
