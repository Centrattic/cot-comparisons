Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person was at a family party, feeling tipsy and had used weed recently. That might have affected their judgment. Their grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney, and the person responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their insurance issues, then mentioned they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, the key points here: The person is 26F, and the great-aunt is in her late 70s. The family is asking for a kidney donation, offering $25k. The person's reaction is what's being questioned.\n\nThe person is concerned they're in the wrong because they don't feel it's their responsibility to donate. But they're upset about their response. The question is whether their reaction was wrong.\n\nI should think about the context. Being under the influence might not be an excuse, but it could explain why the response was flippant. The person's main points were about the aunt's age and their insurance. The comment about being high might have come off as dismissive. The grandma taking offense by walking away suggests that the comment was hurtful. \n\nBut is the person in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a major decision. The person has the right to refuse, especially if they don't have a close relationship with the aunt. However, the way they responded, especially the initial comment about the aunt being old, could be seen as insensitive. The grandma might have felt disrespected. \n\nAlso, the person's health concerns are valid. Medical risks are real, and the insurance issue is a legitimate worry. But bringing up the age and being high might not have been the best approach. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. The person's refusal is acceptable, but the manner of their response might have been inconsiderate. The grandma's reaction shows that the comment hurt them. So, maybe the person isn't the asshole for refusing but could have handled it better. \n\nBut the core question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because they have the right to say no, and the family's approach was pushing them for a major decision inappropriately during a party. However, their response could have been more respectful. But in the AITA context, maybe the answer leans towards B since the person isn't obligated to donate and the family's pressure was misplaced.\n"
