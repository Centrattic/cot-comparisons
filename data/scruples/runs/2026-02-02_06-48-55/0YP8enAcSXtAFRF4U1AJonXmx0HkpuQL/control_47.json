Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author of the story) is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of the great-aunt needing a kidney and suggested the author get tested. The author was shocked, made a comment about the aunt's age, mentioned their insurance concerns, and said they were too high to talk about it. The grandma walked off, and the author feels bad about the reaction, even though they don't want to donate.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author was under the influence, responded in a way that might have been dismissive, and the family members were upset. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong for their reaction, not the decision to not donate.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether the author's manner of responding was inappropriate, given the circumstances. Being under the influence might affect their judgment and tone. The comment about the aunt's age could be seen as insensitive, especially if the family was trying to present the donation as a positive, life-saving act. However, the author is being honest about their state and concerns.\n\nOn one hand, bringing up such a serious topic in a party setting, especially when someone is not sober, might not be the best approach. The author's response was direct and maybe a bit blunt, which could have been hurtful. On the other hand, the author isn't obligated to donate, and their concerns about health insurance are valid. The grandma's reaction (walking away) suggests that the author's comments were taken as offensive, but the author might have been trying to be honest.\n\nThe question is about the reaction, not the decision. The author's tone and the comment about age could be seen as unkind, but considering their state (drugged and drunk), perhaps the family should have approached the topic more sensitively. However, the author's own feelings of being in the wrong might stem from the suddenness of the request and the inappropriate setting. \n\nIn many cases, AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios often look at intent and context. The author didn't want to donate and made that clear, but the way they communicated it might have been careless. The fact that they were under the influence complicates things, as it might not have been the best time for such a serious conversation. The family, however, might have been misguided in bringing it up during a party in that state. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether the author's reaction was wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (not the asshole) because the author had a right to refuse and the family's approach was flawed. The author's honesty, despite the tone, is understandable given the context. So the answer is B.\n"
