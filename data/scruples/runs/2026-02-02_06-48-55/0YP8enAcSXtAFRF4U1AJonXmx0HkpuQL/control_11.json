Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction to being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and was approached by their mom and grandma about donating a kidney for $25k. The author responded by questioning the aunt's age and their own insurance issues, then said they were too high for the conversation. Their family then distanced themselves during the party.\n\nThe key points here are the author's state during the conversation\u2014tipsy and high\u2014what they said, and whether their response was inappropriate. The author didn't outright refuse; they expressed concerns and mentioned their state. The grandma walked away, feeling upset.\n\nLegally, donating a kidney is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to donate, so the monetary offer might be a red flag. Ethically, it's about how they communicated their refusal. The author's initial reaction was to question the age, which might be seen as dismissive, but given the context (under the influence), it's understandable. The part about being too high to discuss is a clear boundary. \n\nThe family's reaction\u2014cutting off interaction for the night\u2014suggests they were upset. But the author's response was honest about their state and concerns. The question is whether the way they reacted was inconsiderate. The grandma walking away was probably hurt by the author's comment about the aunt's age. However, the author's main point was about their own health insurance and being high, which are valid concerns.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, emotional impact is considered. The family's feelings are hurt, but the author isn't the one who initiated the conversation. They were caught off guard and under the influence. The response, while maybe tactless in part, was honest. The financial offer raises questions about the family's motives, which might also be a factor.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for saying no to donating a kidney, but the way they reacted might have been unkind. However, considering their state and the suddenness of the request, their response is more about self-preservation. The grandma's reaction was abrupt, and the author's mention of being high was a reasonable way to disengage. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't obligated to donate and their response, while possibly blunt, was honest and contextually understandable.\n"
