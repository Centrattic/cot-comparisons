Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 26-year-old woman being asked to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, which she was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. She reacted with shock and made some comments, leading to her mom and grandma not talking to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was tipsy and had just smoked weed, so her judgment might not be the best. The family brought up the request in a party setting, which isn't exactly a private or sensitive time. The woman didn't know her great-aunt well and was given a financial incentive. Her response was to question the aunt's age and mention her own health insurance concerns. The grandma walked away, and the family was upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. Kidney donation is a major medical decision. The woman has the right to refuse, especially if she's not comfortable. The fact that she was under the influence might affect how she processed the request, but that's not her fault. However, the way she reacted\u2014maybe being dismissive or making a joke about age? The comment \"isn't she kind of old?\" could be seen as flippant. But in a high state, maybe she didn't realize the gravity.\n\nAlso, the financial incentive of $25k raises ethical questions. Organ donations should be voluntary, and payment can be controversial. The family might have pressure her without considering her stance. The woman's health insurance is a valid concern because the risks are real and she's not in a position to handle potential debt.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not wrong for refusing. The issue is her reaction. Was it disrespectful? Maybe. But given the context\u2014under the influence, not a serious setting, and not a close relationship\u2014maybe her reaction is understandable. She was honest about her state of mind and concerns. The family's expectation to discuss such a serious matter in a casual party setting might also be part of the problem.\n\nSo, balancing all that, the woman isn't the asshole for saying no, but perhaps her tone could have been better. However, considering the circumstances, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
