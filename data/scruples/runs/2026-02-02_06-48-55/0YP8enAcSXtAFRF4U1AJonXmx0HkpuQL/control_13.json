Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that the author was asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt by their mom and grandma during a party. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which they mention is normal in their house. They responded with some hesitations, like the aunt's age and their own insurance issues, and then the grandma walked away, leading to a tense situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in a sober or clear state of mind when the conversation happened. They were tipsy and had just used weed. That could affect their ability to engage in a serious discussion about organ donation. The mom and grandma brought up the request without much prior discussion, and the author's response was somewhat blunt but also honest about their current state.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were in the wrong for how they reacted. The key points here are the timing of the conversation, the author's state at the time, and the way the request was presented. Organ donation is a major decision that requires careful consideration, not something to be brought up in a casual, possibly awkward moment, especially when the person is impaired.\n\nThe author's response was to express concerns about the aunt's age and their own financial situation. These are valid points. Organ donation involves significant risks and costs, and the author has the right to be cautious. The grandma reacting by walking away might be seen as dismissive, but the author's bluntness could have been hurtful, especially to the grandma. However, given the author's state and the fact that the request was made in a context not suitable for such a serious topic, it's hard to say the author is entirely wrong.\n\nThe money offered ($25k) might add another layer. While it's against the law to sell organs in many places, the offer could be seen as a way to offset costs, but the author is right to be concerned about insurance and medical debt. The author's honesty about being high might also be a defense for their reaction, but maybe they could have handled it more tactfully even if they were impaired.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is usually about respect and consideration. The author didn't lash out angrily but rather expressed valid concerns, albeit in a moment where they were not in the best frame of mind. The family's approach to bringing up such a request in a party setting without prior discussion is questionable. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their decision and the way they communicated it, especially given their state and the context.\n"
