Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The story mentions that the person was tipsy and had just used a dab, so not in their right state of mind. They responded with a question about the aunt's age and then mentioned their health insurance issues, leading the grandmother to walk away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was under the influence, which might have affected their judgment and reaction. They didn't immediately refuse but asked a question, which is a common way to respond in surprise. However, their mom and grandma took it as a refusal. The grandmother's reaction was to walk away, which seems like she was hurt.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was inappropriate. They were in a social setting, possibly not the best time for such a serious conversation. Being under the influence could mean they weren't handling it well. However, they did express concerns about their health insurance, which is a valid point. The family offered money, which raises ethical questions about organ donation and financial incentives, but the user is focused on the reaction.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were an asshole for how they reacted, not for refusing the donation. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the assistant's opinion.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's not surprising someone would be shocked at such a sudden request, especially in a relaxed setting. The author's response, while perhaps abrupt, was honest. The problem might be the context\u2014being under the influence and the suddenness of the request. However, the author did voice their concerns, which is reasonable. The grandmother's reaction (walking away) might indicate that the conversation was handled poorly, but the author's responsibility is in question.\n\nAnother angle: the family approached the author in a social gathering without prior discussion, which might have been inconsiderate. The author's response, though perhaps not the best, was a reaction to an unexpected and heavy topic in a relaxed state. The offer of money complicates things but is part of the scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reaction might have been harsh, given the circumstances (under the influence, unexpected request), they might not be entirely at fault. The family might have handled the conversation better. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
