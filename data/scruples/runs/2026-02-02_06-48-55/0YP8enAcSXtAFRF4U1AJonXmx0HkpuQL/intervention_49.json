Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the person reacted by saying the aunt is too old and expressing concerns about their health insurance and being high.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just taken weed, which might affect their ability to have a serious conversation. But even in that state, the reaction might come off as dismissive. They made a comment about the aunt's age, which could be seen as insensitive. The mom tried to counter with positive outcomes, but the author's response was defensive.\n\nThen, the author mentioned their own health insurance issues. That's a valid concern because donating a kidney could lead to unforeseen medical costs. However, bringing up the state of their insurance might sound like they're more focused on the money than the family member's well-being. Also, pointing out they're too high to discuss it could be seen as not taking the conversation seriously.\n\nThe grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author is conflicted, knowing they don't want to donate but feeling bad about their reaction.\n\nI should weigh the validity of the author's concerns against the way they expressed them. While the author has the right to refuse, the manner in which they did so might have been hurtful. The comment about age could be particularly jarring, even if unintentional. Also, the financial aspect could imply a lack of empathy.\n\nBut the author was under the influence, which might affect their judgment. However, being under the influence doesn't excuse being disrespectful. The family's request is a heavy topic, and the author's reaction might have been inappropriate regardless of their state.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate, but their reaction could be seen as the problem. The question is whether the reaction makes them the asshole. The way they responded might have been inconsiderate, so maybe they are in the wrong for the reaction, even if the decision is understandable.\n"
