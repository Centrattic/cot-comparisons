Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 26-year-old woman, was at a family party and under the influence of alcohol and weed. Her mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, offering $25k. She responded by questioning the aunt's age and her own insurance, which upset them. Now she's asking if she's the asshole for her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was not in a clear state of mind, which might affect how she responded. The request was surprising and sudden. The offer of money could be a red flag, maybe even for financial reasons. Also, she didn't say yes, which is her right. But the way she reacted\u2014maybe being dismissive or making a joke about the aunt's age\u2014could be seen as insensitive.\n\nHer grandma walked away, and they didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. The author is conflicted because she doesn't want to donate but feels bad about how she reacted. The key points here are her state (intoxicated), the suddenness of the request, the financial incentive, and the potential insensitivity in her response.\n\nOn one hand, it's a serious medical decision, and she's not obligated to do it. On the other hand, bringing it up in a party setting while she was under the influence might not have been the best approach. Also, making a comment about the aunt's age could come off as disrespectful, even if it was a nervous reaction.\n\nBut I think the main issue is that she was unprepared for such a serious conversation in that setting. The family might have expected a more composed response, but she was high and not thinking clearly. The offer of money is also a bit concerning because organ donation shouldn't be motivated by financial gain. She's standing up for her own health and financial concerns, which is valid. However, the way she said it might have been abrupt or hurtful.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a judgment call. The author isn't wrong for refusing, but maybe she could have handled the conversation better. But given the circumstances\u2014intoxication, surprise request, financial aspect\u2014maybe she's not the asshole. So I'm leaning towards B (No), but I'm a bit unsure. However, the comment about the aunt's age was probably the worst part. Maybe that was the main issue. If she had said no respectfully, it might have been better. But since she was upset and under the influence, her reaction might be excusable. So I think the answer is B.\n"
