Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author wrote a story where they were asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt by their mom and grandma during a party. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected their judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 26, the great-aunt is in her late 70s, and the family is asking for a kidney donation. The author didn't know the great-aunt well and was in a compromised state mentally when the conversation happened. They responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their financial concerns, which upset the family, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the main factors here are the author's state of mind when the conversation started and the appropriateness of the family's request. Asking someone to donate an organ is a huge decision that should be made with full mental clarity and without pressure. The author was under the influence, which could have led to an impulsive or poorly thought-out response. The comment about the aunt's age (\"isn't she kind of old?\") might have been a defensive reaction to the unexpected proposal. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might have felt the author was dismissive or disrespectful, especially since Grandma walked away. However, the author is not obligated to donate an organ, especially to a distant relative they don't know well. The financial offer of $25k could hint at a transactional aspect, which is ethically problematic since organ sales are illegal in many places. \n\nThe author's concerns about their health insurance are valid, as medical complications can lead to debt. Their refusal is understandable. The way they reacted might have been unkind, but given their state, maybe it's excusable. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the reaction was inappropriate, even if the refusal is justified, the author might be at fault for the manner of response. But if the family brought up the request in a poor context (intoxicated person, unexpected proposal), the author isn't necessarily wrong for pushing back.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for refusing to donate an organ, and the conversation was initiated in a context where they weren't in a good state to handle it. The family might have handled the request poorly, and the author's reaction, while maybe not the best way to handle it, isn't their fault entirely. They have the right to say no, especially under those circumstances.\n"
