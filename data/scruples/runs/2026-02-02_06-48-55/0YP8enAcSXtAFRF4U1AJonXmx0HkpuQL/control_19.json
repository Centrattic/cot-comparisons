Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author, a 26-year-old woman, was at a family party where she was asked to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. She was tipsy and had just smoked weed, so she wasn't in a serious mindset. The conversation came up suddenly, and she responded with shock, questioning the aunt's age and her own financial concerns. Her grandma walked away, and they didn't talk to her the rest of the night. The author is wondering if she's the asshole for her reaction.\n\nHmm. First, the key points here: the request is for a kidney donation, which is a major medical decision. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected her ability to handle such a serious topic. The family offered $25k, which raises questions about potential coercion or financial incentives for an organ donation. \n\nIn many places, selling organs is illegal, so the $25k might be a problematic part. The author is within her rights to refuse. But her reaction was dismissive and maybe a bit flippant, especially given the context. However, considering she was high and not in the right state, maybe her response is understandable. \n\nThe author did express her concerns about her health insurance and debt, which are valid points. The grandma and mom's reaction was to walk away, which could be seen as harsh. But the author is asking if she's in the wrong for how she reacted. \n\nThe main factors: the suddenness of the request, the author's state at the time, the financial aspect, and the relationship with the great-aunt. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the aunt, so the expectation to donate might be unreasonable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She has the right to refuse, and her state might have led to a less-than-ideal reaction, but the circumstances (influence, financial offer, lack of prior meaningful relationship) mitigate against her being the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
