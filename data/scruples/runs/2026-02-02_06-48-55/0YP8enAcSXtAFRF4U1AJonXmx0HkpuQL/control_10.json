Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author is 26, female, and the family offered $25k. The situation happened during a party where she was tipsy and had smoked weed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was in a compromised state (under the influence) when the conversation happened. She didn't know the great-aunt well and the family wasn't close. The main question is whether her reaction was wrong.\n\nHer response was to question the aunt's age and express concerns about her own health insurance and the appropriateness of the conversation under her current state. The mom and grandma were upset, especially the grandma walking away. The author now feels bad about the way she reacted.\n\nLegally, donating a kidney is a personal choice, and financial incentives (like $25k) might be ethically iffy but not illegal. However, the main issue here is the emotional reaction. The author was not in the right mind to have a serious conversation. She was under the influence, which is mentioned as normal in her household. Her response was direct but maybe not the best way to handle it while high. However, she's not obligated to donate a kidney, so her refusal isn't wrong. The question is about the reaction, not the decision itself.\n\nHer response was a bit abrupt (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and then adding about her insurance and being high. Maybe being more diplomatic would have helped, but considering her state, perhaps it's understandable. The grandma taking offense and walking away might have been more about the way it was brought up. The author's mom and grandma might have approached her in a way that was sudden and without considering her current mental state.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were under the influence and didn't handle it well, but the main issue is their right to say no. The author's intentions weren't malicious. The answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong because they have the right to refuse and the situation was not ideal for such a serious conversation. The problem lies more with the family bringing it up under those circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
