I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password due to unpaid rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi connection for their neighbor on the condition that she pays $40/month. Initially, she paid on time, then started being late, offered half now/half later, and then stopped paying entirely. The author is considering changing the password until payment is received.\n\nThe main issue here is whether changing the password is justified. Let's break down the factors. There's an agreement between the parties. The neighbor agreed to pay, and the author agreed to provide internet. The neighbor hasn't been paying, so the author wants to enforce payment by cutting off access.\n\nLegally, if there's a contract or agreement, the author might have the right to stop providing the service if the neighbor breaches the terms. However, the setup isn't a formal service agreement but a personal arrangement. In many jurisdictions, landlords can't just cut off utilities for non-payment unless there's a specific clause allowing it. But this isn't a landlord-tenant situation; it's more of a personal service agreement. So the legal aspect might be murky here.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a payment they believe is owed. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed, which the author finds frustrating, especially since they're saving for a mortgage. The author isn't in dire need of the money but wants the neighbor to honor the agreement. Changing the password is a way to enforce the terms they both agreed to.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor might argue that the agreement wasn't formal, and the author shouldn't unilaterally change the password without notice or a proper process. There's also the consideration of how to handle such disputes\u2014maybe through communication, reminders, or even mediation.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the neighbor. Cutting off internet access could inconvenience her, especially if she's a single mom who relies on it. However, the author provided the service as a favor, and the neighbor's failure to pay as agreed could justify the action from the author's perspective.\n\nThe author's approach might be seen as taking matters into their own hands rather than seeking legal or formal resolution. If the neighbor is in breach of the agreement, the proper course might be to send a formal notice or involve a mediator, not just cut off the service.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the agreement was clear and the neighbor breached it, the author might be justified in enforcing the terms. However, changing the password without a formal agreement or legal basis could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's a personal arrangement. The author should have perhaps first tried to communicate the issue, sent reminders, or given a notice before taking such action. \n\nTherefore, while the neighbor isn't paying, the author's method of enforcing payment might not be the most appropriate. They might be in the wrong for not following proper procedures to resolve the dispute amicably first. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're using unilateral action without following proper dispute resolution steps, which could be seen as aggressive or unfair in a personal arrangement.\n"
