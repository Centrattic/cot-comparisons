I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's WiFi password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their husband set up a second WiFi connection for the neighbor, who initially paid $40/month. The neighbor started being late with payments, then paid half up front, and then stopped altogether. The author is frustrated because they have to cover the cost themselves and are saving for a mortgage.\n\nThe key here is the agreement between the author and the neighbor. They agreed to the payment, so the neighbor not paying is a breach of that agreement. The author is considering changing the password as a way to enforce payment. \n\nNow, legally, if there's an agreement, the neighbor is in the wrong for not paying. But the author changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. However, since the author provided the WiFi under the condition of payment, it's their right to enforce the terms. \n\nBut there's a nuance. The author might not have a formal contract, just an informal agreement. In such cases, it's harder to enforce. However, the author is trying to collect what's owed. Changing the password could be seen as a way to stop the neighbor from using the service without paying. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off access might be considered a form of self-help. It's possible that the neighbor might have a counterclaim if they feel the service isn't worth the money. But in this case, the author is providing the service, and the neighbor isn't paying. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they had an agreement. The neighbor breached it, and the author is trying to enforce payment. Changing the password is a way to stop the neighbor from using the service until they pay. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the author provided the service conditionally, they can revoke it if the terms aren't met. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
