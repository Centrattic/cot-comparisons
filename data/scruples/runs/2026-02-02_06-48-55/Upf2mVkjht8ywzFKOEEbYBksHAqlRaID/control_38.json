I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: the couple set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, who offered to pay $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, then paid half, then stopped altogether. The author wants to change the password until payment is received.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether changing the Wi-Fi password is a justified response. Let me think about the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the couple provided an internet service in exchange for payment, there's an informal agreement. But the neighbor isn't a customer of the ISP; she's using the couple's service. So, the couple has the technical right to control access to their own network. However, there might be terms of service from their actual ISP that prohibit reselling or sharing the internet. If they violated that, they could be the ones at fault. But the problem here is more about the payment dispute.\n\nEthically, the couple is trying to enforce the agreed-upon payment. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed, so the couple is cutting off access as a form of payment enforcement. But is that fair? The couple mentions they can afford to pay the bill themselves, but they're using the money for their own goals (mortgage savings). The neighbor, on the other hand, seems to have the means to pay but isn't. \n\nChanging the password is a direct action, but maybe they should have communicated more first? Like sending a formal notice or trying to resolve it through communication before taking technical action. However, the author did mention that the neighbor isn't proactive in paying and doesn't bring up the issue when they meet. So maybe the author is justified in taking action since the neighbor hasn't fulfilled their part of the agreement.\n\nAnother angle: if the couple didn't have a written agreement, maybe their own actions are ambiguous. But they did agree verbally, and the neighbor asked for the service. So the author is trying to enforce the terms they agreed to. The neighbor might argue that the service was provided without a formal contract, making it hard to enforce. However, the author is within their rights to manage their own network, even if the neighbor was relying on it.\n\nPotential consequences: The neighbor could report it, but if the author changed the password, it's their own network. However, if the neighbor has a legal claim, maybe? Not sure. Legally, it's a gray area because the neighbor isn't a customer. The author might be in the right because they control the network, but ethically, cutting off access abruptly might be harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to ask for payment before disconnecting, but the author is in a position where they can enforce terms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are enforcing an agreed-upon payment for a service they provided. The neighbor didn't uphold her end, so the author is taking action to protect their own interests. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
