I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password to get payment. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband let a neighbor use their internet for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, then paid half, then stopped. The author wants to change the password until payment is made.\n\nSo, the key points here. They had an agreement. The neighbor isn't paying. The author is considering cutting off access by changing the password. \n\nLegally, I'm not sure. But ethically, maybe. Since they set up the second wifi connection as a favor, but maybe there was an understanding that payment was required. If the neighbor is using the service without paying, that's a breach of their agreement. But is changing the password a form of taking justice into their own hands?\n\nThe author mentions that they can afford it, but they're saving for a mortgage. The neighbor is using the service but not paying, which is unfair. However, changing the password might be seen as a form of punishment or coercion. The neighbor might still have access unless they pay, which could be considered a hostile act.\n\nAlso, in some places, disconnecting someone's internet might be illegal if they're using a service they've been allowed to access. But since it's a separate setup, maybe it's more of a private agreement. The author might be within their rights to stop the service if payment isn't made, but the method of doing it (changing the password) could be problematic if done without notice.\n\nAnother angle: The neighbor might not have agreed to the terms of service being cut off for non-payment. The original agreement was verbal, perhaps? If there's no formal contract, the author might be taking matters into their own hands. But if the neighbor agreed to pay, then the author is enforcing that agreement.\n\nBut ethically, is it wrong? The neighbor is using the service without paying, so the author is trying to enforce payment. However, the proper way would be to send a formal notice to pay or terminate the service. Changing the password without prior communication could be seen as harsh. However, the author might feel justified given the neighbor's repeated non-payment.\n\nIn the end, the author is trying to enforce a payment agreement, which isn't inherently wrong. But the method might be considered confrontational without following proper steps. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
