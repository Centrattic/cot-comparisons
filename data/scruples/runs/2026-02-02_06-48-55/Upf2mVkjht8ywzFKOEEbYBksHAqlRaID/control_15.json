I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong by changing their neighbor's internet password after the neighbor stopped paying. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, who initially paid $40/month. Then the payments became irregular: late, half payments, and then stopped. The neighbor has the means to pay but doesn't, and the author is considering changing the password to stop her access until she pays. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the neighbor agreed to pay, the agreement was made, the neighbor is not fulfilling their end, and the author is considering revoking access. Legally and ethically, when someone breaks an agreement, the other party may take certain actions to enforce it. But here's the catch: providing internet access isn't a service that's typically governed by a formal contract. It's more of an informal arrangement. \n\nIn many places, intentionally disrupting someone's access to services they've paid for or agreed to pay for could be considered a civil wrong. Even though the neighbor wasn't a direct customer of the internet provider, the author is acting as the provider here. By changing the password, the author is effectively cutting off service, which might be a breach of the implied agreement. However, if the payments are being withheld, the author might have the right to stop the service as a form of self-help.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a social aspect. The author is in a close-knit apartment building, and such an action could lead to tension. Also, if the neighbor is using the service without paying, it's a matter of fairness. But the author mentions they can afford to pay the bill themselves and that the neighbor doesn't seem to be in financial distress. \n\nLegally, if there's no written contract, the situation is more ambiguous. The author might be seen as acting unilaterally, which could be problematic. Ethically, it's about whether cutting off the internet is a fair response. Some might argue that the author should have pursued other means, like a formal agreement or involving the landlord or a mediator, rather than taking it upon themselves to change the password.\n\nAlso, consider that if the neighbor is in breach, the author could be within their rights to stop the service, but there might be better ways to handle it without escalating conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing the password. If the agreement was mutual and the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part, then the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author's action could be seen as retaliatory or illegal if the internet was part of a service that the neighbor legally subscribed to through the landlord or a different provider. Wait, the user says the internet was installed and a second connection set up for the neighbor. So the author's internet service might be the only source for the neighbor. If the author is the sole provider, then they might have the right to stop the service if the neighbor isn't paying. \n\nHowever, changing the password without prior notice might be abrupt. If there was a clear understanding that non-payment would result in loss of service, then it's more justified. But if there was no explicit agreement about consequences for non-payment, then it's less clear. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, this kind of dispute might be considered a civil matter, not a criminal one. So the author isn't committing a crime by changing the password, but they might be breaching an informal contract. The neighbor could argue that she's been using the service and now it's being cut off, which could lead to a legal dispute over the money owed. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can afford to keep paying the bill, so maybe they should cover the cost themselves and then pursue the neighbor for reimbursement. But the question is about changing the password. If the author is acting on a mutual agreement where the neighbor's access is contingent on payment, then changing the password is a logical step. However, if the neighbor's access was a favor and not a formal arrangement, then it's a different story.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author made an agreement expecting payment, and the neighbor isn't paying, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the terms of that agreement. However, the method of enforcement (changing the password without notice) could be seen as harsh. Maybe a letter or notice first would be better. But the question is just about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the best course of action. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were providing a service in exchange for money, and the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part. The author has the right to stop the service. However, there's a consideration that this could be a civil issue and maybe a better way to handle it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about legal procedures.\n"
