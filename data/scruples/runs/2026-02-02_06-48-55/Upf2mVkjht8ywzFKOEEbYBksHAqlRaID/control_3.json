I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if changing the neighbor's internet password is wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: The neighbors had an agreement where they provided internet access in exchange for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid but then started missing payments, paying half, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the key points here. There's an agreement, but it's informal\u2014just a verbal one. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed. The author is frustrated and wants to cut off the service until payment is made.\n\nNow, legal perspective: If there's no formal contract, the author might not have a legal claim if they change the password. But ethically, is it okay? Well, the neighbor is using a resource they agreed to pay for, and they're not honoring that. The author is trying to enforce the terms they agreed upon.\n\nBut here's the catch: the internet is provided through the author's own setup. If they change the password, they're technically blocking access that was part of an informal agreement. However, since it's not a legal contract, the neighbor might still be able to challenge that. Also, depending on local laws, altering someone's access to a shared resource without a formal agreement might not be illegal, but it could be seen as a breach of trust or an ethical issue.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions they can afford it, but they want to save for a mortgage. The neighbor, on the other hand, seems to have the means to pay but isn't. The author is trying to get their payment, which is fair. However, the method of enforcement\u2014changing the password\u2014might be seen as harsh or a bit of a power move, especially if there's no prior discussion or notice.\n\nEthically, the author has a right to enforce the terms of their agreement. But maybe they should have communicated more first. Confronting the neighbor in a respectful way before taking action might have been better. But since the neighbor has been ignoring the payments and not addressing the debt, the author might feel justified in taking action to protect their own interests.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author isn't wrong for wanting payment, and the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part. However, changing the password could be seen as cutting off a necessary service, which might be harsh. But on the flip side, the author is within their rights to manage their own network as they see fit.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If there's an agreement, even informal, enforcing it by stopping the service when the other party isn't holding up their end isn't necessarily wrong. But the method might be questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would hinge on whether the action is justified under the terms of their agreement.\n\nGiven that they made an agreement and the neighbor hasn't complied, the author's action could be seen as a way to enforce that agreement. However, the lack of a formal contract might mean there's no legal recourse, so ethically, it's more of a moral judgment call. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to protect their own interests.\n"
