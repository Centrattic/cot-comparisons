I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying for the shared internet service. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The neighbor initially agreed to pay $40/month for the internet. She started paying on time, then got late, then paid half, then stopped altogether. The author and their husband are providing the second WiFi connection, which the neighbor is using without paying. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author has the right to cut off the neighbor's internet access by changing the password. Legally, the neighbor is using a service they've agreed to pay for but haven't. The author set up the WiFi as a service, so there's a mutual agreement. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author could argue they're not fulfilling their part of the deal. However, the author isn't a service provider but a private individual. So, what are the legal rights here?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, people can't just cut off utilities or services without following proper procedures. For example, if a landlord wants to shut off a tenant's utilities, there are specific legal steps involved. Here, the author isn't the landlord but is providing a service. The neighbor might have a right to access the internet as per their agreement. But by changing the password, the author is using a technical means to deny access. That could be seen as a violation of the neighbor's rights if they're contractually entitled to the service.\n\nEthically, maybe the author has a point. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author is out of pocket. But ethically, it's still a gray area. The author might feel justified, but the neighbor might feel wronged. Legally, however, the author isn't the official provider, so they can't enforce payment through such drastic measures. The proper course would be to communicate, send a formal notice, and possibly involve the building management or take legal action if necessary. Changing the password unilaterally could be seen as a breach of the agreement or even illegal if the neighbor is relying on that service.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's actions (using the internet without paying) could be considered a breach of their agreement. But the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they're taking matters into their own hands instead of using legal or administrative channels. Cutting off the service without due process could lead to further conflict or legal issues for the author.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because their action is a form of self-help without proper legal recourse. They should instead address the issue through formal communication or seek mediation. Changing the password is a direct action that might not be legally justified and could escalate the problem.\n"
