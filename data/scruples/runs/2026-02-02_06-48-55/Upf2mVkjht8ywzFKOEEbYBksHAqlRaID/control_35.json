I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The scenario involves a neighbor who initially agreed to pay $40 a month for internet access. The neighbor started late-paying and then stopped altogether. The author is considering cutting off the neighbor's internet until the debt is settled.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the neighbor's internet is part of a service agreement. If the author provided the internet through their own setup, they might have some control over access. However, if the internet is a shared service (like a building-wide connection), changing someone else's password could be against the terms of service or even illegal. It could be considered unauthorized tampering with another person's access to a service, especially if it's a paid service.\n\nEthically, the author has a right to expect payment as per their agreement. However, taking matters into their own hands by changing the password might be seen as taking a harsh or retaliatory action. There might be better ways to resolve the issue, like sending a formal notice, involving a mediator, or even legal action if the amount is significant. But since the amount is $40 a month, which isn't a huge sum, maybe the costs of legal action would outweigh the debt.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they can afford the loss but want to save for a mortgage. So, it's not just about the money but also about the principle of people keeping their word. However, cutting off the internet without a formal agreement might not be legally enforceable. Unless there was a written contract that specifies the consequences of non-payment, the author might not have the legal right to do so. \n\nMoreover, in some places, changing someone's password without their consent could be a violation of privacy laws or even a criminal offense, especially if it's considered a form of harassment or denial of service. The neighbor could potentially sue for damages, which could cost more than the debt.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might be in the wrong if there's no formal agreement allowing them to cut off the service. Ethically, while the neighbor isn't paying, the author's method of enforcement could be problematic. The better approach would be to pursue legal means, like a small claims court, rather than taking unilateral action. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
