I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be a Total Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe author lives in a small apartment building and shares the internet with a neighbor. They set up a second WiFi connection for the neighbor, who's a single mom, in exchange for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then became late, offered to pay half now and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author argues that the neighbor isn't in financial distress, judging by her frequent shopping and new car. The author feels it's the neighbor's responsibility to bring up the payment, and since she hasn't, they're considering changing her WiFi password until she pays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, sharing internet and charging a fee is a gray area. In many jurisdictions, internet service is contracted under a specific address, and allowing others to use it isn't part of the service agreement. So, the author might not have a legal right to charge the neighbor. However, they've been doing this on a mutual agreement. Now, the neighbor isn't paying, leading the author to consider revoking access. \n\nEthically, the author and husband agreed to the arrangement, and the neighbor is defaulting. The author has a point about not wanting to chase the neighbor for payments. But changing the password unilaterally could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The neighbor might rely on internet access for work, communication, or other essential needs. The author mentions that they can afford the monthly cost, but the neighbor's non-payment could be a breach of their original agreement. \n\nThe key issues here are: 1) Did the author have a formal agreement? 2) Is changing the password a reasonable response to the neighbor stopping payments? 3) Could this action affect the neighbor's daily life or responsibilities? \n\nIf the agreement was informal, the author might not have a solid footing to enforce it. Even if it was agreed upon, there's no legal recourse if the neighbor doesn't comply. Ethically, while the author feels wronged, taking away internet access might be harsh, especially if the neighbor is using it for necessary purposes. The author might be justified in wanting payment, but changing the password without discussing it could escalate the issue and be considered inconsiderate or even a bit of a power move. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's behavior is a problem\u2014she stopped paying without notice and the author hasn't communicated about it. The author could have approached her to discuss the payment issue before taking action. Instead, changing the password might lead to conflict and could be seen as an asshole move because it's cutting off a service she might depend on. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They should have communicated first and perhaps followed up on the payments, but revoking access without talking to the neighbor could be unfair. The neighbor might have reasons for not paying, and the author's action is a bit abrupt and potentially harmful.\n"
