I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether changing the neighbor's internet password is wrong. The scenario is that the neighbor agreed to pay $40/month for internet access. Initially, she paid on time, then became late, then offered half up front, then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nFirst, the agreement between the parties: they had a verbal agreement where the neighbor pays for internet. But there's no mention of a written contract. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be harder to enforce. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author wants to cut off access as a form of payment collection.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author has the legal right to disconnect the neighbor's internet. The internet service is likely under the author's name, so technically, they own the service. However, the neighbor might have a claim if there was an agreement. But without a formal contract, the author's actions might not be legally protected either. However, the author isn't being malicious; they're trying to enforce a prior agreement.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations: The author is trying to enforce a payment they were promised. The neighbor isn't fulfilling her part, and the author is using the internet access as leverage. But is it right to cut off someone's internet? It could be seen as a form of self-help, but it might also be considered a breach of privacy or an illegal act. In some places, tampering with someone else's access to services could be illegal even if it's your own network.\n\nAlso, the neighbor might not have a legal right to the internet. If the author's agreement was just a favor, maybe the neighbor isn't entitled to it. But the fact that they agreed to pay suggests it's more than a favor. The author's actions could be seen as enforcing their own terms, but without proper legal steps, it might not be the best approach. They should ideally go through legal channels, like sending a formal demand or small claims court, before taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have a right to expect payment, but enforcing it by changing the password without legal recourse might be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because changing the password could be an illegal act or at least a breach of the neighbor's rights if there's no formal agreement. Alternatively, if the agreement was valid, maybe B (not in the wrong). But typically, without a contract, the author's actions could be seen as self-help but still potentially illegal. So leaning towards A.\n"
