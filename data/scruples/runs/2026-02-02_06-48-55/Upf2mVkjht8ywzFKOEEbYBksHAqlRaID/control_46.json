I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because the neighbor hasn't been paying as agreed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, a single mom, who agreed to pay $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, paid half, and then stopped. The author feels she can afford it and doesn't want to chase her for payments. The author is considering changing the password until she pays up.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password a reasonable action, or is the author in the wrong?\n\nLet me break it down. There was an agreement between the two parties. The neighbor agreed to pay $40/month for the internet. When she stops paying, the author is trying to enforce that agreement. But how does that work legally or socially?\n\nLegally, maybe the author isn't in the right. If they provided the service (the Wi-Fi), and the neighbor wasn't paying, the proper way might be to terminate the service through legal means, like sending a formal notice or seeking small claims court. Changing the password without notice might be a breach of the agreement or even a civil wrong, depending on local laws. However, the author isn't a service provider; they're just sharing their internet. So maybe there's no formal contract here. But they did agree to a payment arrangement.\n\nSocially, is it okay to cut off someone's internet? The neighbor might be relying on it for work or communication. The author is trying to enforce a payment arrangement, but maybe the right approach is to communicate more clearly first. The author mentions that the neighbor doesn't bring up the payments when they see each other, which could be an issue of communication. If the author didn't explicitly state that non-payment would result in losing access, then changing the password might be seen as going too far without prior agreement.\n\nAlso, the author says they can afford the money but are saving for a mortgage. It's understandable they want the payments, but using the password change as a tactic might be seen as a hostile move. The neighbor might retaliate or there could be legal issues if the author is blocking someone's access without proper notice.\n\nAnother angle: when they set up the second Wi-Fi, were they allowed to do that? If it's their internet service, they can control access. But if the neighbor was paying them, maybe there's an informal contract. If the neighbor isn't paying, then the author has the right to stop the service, but they should follow the terms they agreed upon. If there was no explicit agreement that non-payment leads to loss of service, then the author might be acting unilaterally. However, since the neighbor was paying them, the author is acting as a service provider in a way, so they might have the right to terminate the service if payments aren't made.\n\nBut again, the key is whether there was a clear agreement on the consequences of non-payment. If the author didn't communicate that not paying would result in losing the Wi-Fi, then changing the password could be seen as a breach of trust or a hostile action. The neighbor might not have expected that. Plus, if the neighbor is using the Wi-Fi, maybe the author isn't technically \"wrong\" in controlling access, but it's still a bit of a gray area.\n\nAlso, the neighbor might have other means to get internet, but if she relies on it, cutting it off could be problematic. The author should consider if there's a better way to handle this, like sending a final notice before changing the password. They could also involve the landlord or building management if there's a formal setup for shared utilities.\n\nIn terms of the WIBTA community's perspective, they often consider social acceptability. Changing someone's password without notice might be seen as an asshole move because it's an aggressive action without clear prior communication. They might suggest escalating the issue through proper channels or having a final conversation first.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is trying to enforce a payment agreement but may not have followed through with proper communication or legal/social norms. Changing the password abruptly could be seen as overstepping, especially if there was no prior agreement on consequences. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they're taking unilateral action without proper notice or following through with more appropriate methods.\n"
