I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation is that the neighbor agreed to pay $40/month for internet access, but started missing payments. Now the author is considering cutting off the internet until the debt is paid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement between the two parties. They had a verbal or mutual agreement where the neighbor pays for the internet. The neighbor initially paid but then stopped. The author is not getting paid, so they want to enforce payment by changing the password. \n\nLegally, if there's a contract, the author might have the right to enforce payment. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as a breach of the agreement or even illegal, depending on local laws. In many places, cutting off services without proper notice or following legal procedures could lead to liability. Also, the neighbor might have a right to continue using the service if they have a contract, even if they are in arrears.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect their own interests. They are saving for a mortgage and have kids, so the money matters. On the other hand, cutting off internet access abruptly could be seen as harsh. The neighbor might argue that they have a dependency on the internet for work, communication, etc., especially since she's a single mom.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author mentions that the neighbor hasn't approached them to discuss the payments. The author might be justified in wanting to enforce payment, but perhaps should have given more notice or followed up before taking action. Changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels, like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator.\n\nIn terms of community norms, using a \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Termed an Asshole) forum suggests the author is seeking social validation. The community's response might lean towards understanding the frustration but also cautioning against unilateral actions that could escalate the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in a difficult situation, but changing the password without prior communication or legal steps could be considered wrong. It's a violation of the neighbor's expected service if there's a binding agreement. The right approach would involve formal notice and possibly legal recourse rather than self-help measures. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
