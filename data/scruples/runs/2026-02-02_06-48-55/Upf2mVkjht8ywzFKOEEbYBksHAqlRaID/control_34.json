I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, the situation: The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, and they agreed. Initially, she paid, then got late, then half payments, then stopped. The author is considering changing the password until payment is received.\n\nLegally, I'm not sure. If there's an agreement, but it's not a legal contract, maybe it's hard to enforce. But ethically, is it right to cut off service because of unpaid fees? The author mentions they can afford the money but it's part of their savings plan. The neighbor isn't being forced to pay, but she agreed to the terms. If she's not paying, maybe the author is justified in enforcing the agreement. However, changing the password unilaterally could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The proper approach might be to confront the neighbor or involve the landlord if it's a shared service. Also, if the internet is provided by the building, maybe the landlord has a policy about this. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The author might be right in wanting to enforce the agreement, but their method could be problematic. Maybe they should have tried other steps first, like a formal notice or mediation. However, the neighbor isn't making efforts to pay either, just buying expensive items. The author's action is a form of leverage. It's a gray area. But since the original agreement was mutual, and the neighbor isn't honoring her part, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that cutting off internet is a harsh measure, even if it's their own setup. So, answer could be B (No) because they're enforcing an agreed-upon payment, but others might say A (Yes) because it's a personal agreement without legal backing. Hmm. I think the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure. The key is whether the action is justified under their initial agreement. Since the neighbor agreed to pay, the author is within their rights to enforce it, even if the method is a bit informal.\n"
