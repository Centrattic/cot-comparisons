I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's WiFi password because the neighbor isn't paying the agreed-upon fee. \n\nFirst, there's an agreement between the two parties. The neighbor offered to pay $40 a month for internet access, and the original poster (OP) and her husband agreed. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, then paid half, then stopped altogether. The OP is frustrated because the neighbor seems to have the money but isn't following through.\n\nNow, the key point here is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, if there's a verbal agreement, it's still an agreement, but enforcing it might be tricky without a written contract. However, the neighbor is using the internet without paying, which could be considered a breach of their agreement. \n\nThe OP is not getting the money they expected, and they want to enforce payment. By cutting off access, they're trying to enforce the terms they set. However, changing the password might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Maybe the neighbor could still argue that the agreement wasn't formal, especially if it was verbal. Also, the internet service is under the OP's name, so they have control over it. \n\nBut here's the thing: the neighbor might have a right to access if the agreement was valid. However, if the neighbor isn't paying, the OP is within their rights to stop the service, as it's their own internet. However, the method of cutting off service (changing the password) might be considered aggressive or confrontational without a formal agreement. \n\nAnother angle: the OP isn't losing money, but they want to save for a mortgage. It's about setting boundaries. But if the neighbor feels wronged, it could lead to conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the agreement was mutual and the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part, the OP might not be wrong to enforce the terms. However, the lack of a formal agreement could complicate things. But since the neighbor agreed and then reneged, the OP is trying to uphold their side. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the OP should have a conversation or send a formal notice before changing the password. Taking direct action without prior communication could be seen as harsh. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn the \"Asshole\" context, people often debate whether the action is justified. If the action is seen as fair given the breach, then the answer is B. If it's seen as too harsh or not properly handled, then A. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong since they're enforcing a mutual agreement. However, the method could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for considering it. I think the answer is B (No), because they have a right to expect payment and control their own internet. Even though the communication could be better, the action is a response to a breach of agreement.\n"
