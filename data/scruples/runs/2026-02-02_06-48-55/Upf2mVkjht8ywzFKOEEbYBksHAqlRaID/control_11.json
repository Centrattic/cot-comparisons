I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their neighbor's internet password is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbor offered to pay $40 a month for internet access, which the couple agreed to. The neighbor initially paid on time but then started being late, offered half now half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The couple is considering changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the couple might own the internet service and have the right to control access. If the neighbor is using the internet without paying, it's like a breach of their agreement. But were there any formal terms when they initially set this up? If it was just an informal agreement, there might not be legal enforceability. However, the neighbor agreed to pay, so the couple could argue it's a contract. \n\nEthically, the neighbor isn't paying as promised, so the couple is trying to enforce the terms they agreed upon. The neighbor's actions (not paying and using the internet) could be seen as taking advantage. The couple isn't in dire need of the money but wants to save for a mortgage. Changing the password could be a way to enforce payment, which might be justified as self-help.\n\nOn the other hand, shutting off the internet could be seen as cutting off a utility, which might be harsh. If the neighbor is a single mom, it might affect her children's access to the internet. Is there a better way to handle it, like sending a formal request or involving the landlord or a mediator?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the neighbor isn't paying, the couple could argue it's their right to stop the service. Ethically, maybe there's a gray area, but since the neighbor agreed to pay, the couple's action is enforcing the agreed terms. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). But need to consider local laws. If changing the password is a legitimate way to enforce payment, then the answer is B. If there's no formal agreement, maybe it's not enforceable, but the neighbor's actions suggest they agreed verbally.\n"
