I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation involves a neighbor who agreed to pay for internet access, but stopped paying. The author wants to cut off the neighbor's access until payment is made.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there was an agreement and the neighbor isn't paying, the author might have a right to enforce payment. However, changing the password could be seen as a form of self-help. But maybe there are legal limits here. For example, if the neighbor is using the internet without a formal service agreement, maybe the author can't just cut them off like that. Or maybe since they set up a second connection, it's more of an informal arrangement.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness. The neighbor agreed to pay, but isn't. The author is trying to enforce the agreement. But cutting off internet might be considered harsh, especially if there are children involved. But the author mentions that the neighbor is not in a financial hardship, so maybe she can afford to pay. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is understandable\u2014they\u2019re saving for a mortgage and want to avoid being taken advantage of. But is changing the password a reasonable response? Maybe they should have tried to communicate better first, like sending a formal notice or terminating the agreement properly. \n\nAnother angle: did they have a written agreement? If it's just a verbal agreement, it might be harder to enforce. If the neighbor is using the internet as part of a service the author is paying for, then the author has the right to control access. But if the neighbor was supposed to pay for her own internet, then maybe the initial setup was improper. Wait, the neighbor approached them with the offer. So maybe the setup was to share the existing internet, but the neighbor pays a portion. If she's not paying, the author could legally stop allowing her access, but changing the password without notice might be abrupt. \n\nAlso, there's a consideration of how the author's actions might affect the neighbor. If the neighbor relies on the internet for work or other necessities, cutting it off could be problematic. However, the author mentions that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble, so maybe she can handle it. \n\nIn terms of wrongness, the author is trying to enforce a prior agreement. However, the method might be questionable. Maybe they should have gone through proper channels, like sending a formal notice to pay up or terminate the service. Changing the password directly could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might be in the wrong. But if there was a mutual agreement and the neighbor is breaching it, the author has some rights. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, if there's an enforceable agreement, the author might be justified. Ethically, it's about whether cutting off internet is a fair response. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the action was proportional and if proper notice was given. The author didn't mention giving formal notice, just changing the password. So maybe they are in the wrong because they didn't follow proper procedures. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear and the neighbor is in breach, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are: the existence of an agreement, whether the author properly communicated the need for payment, and if changing the password is an appropriate remedy. Since the author hasn't tried to formally terminate the agreement but just changed the password, it's possible they are in the wrong because they didn't follow due process. So answer A (yes) or B (no)? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if there's an expectation of payment and the neighbor isn't fulfilling it, the author is within their rights to stop the service. But without a formal agreement, maybe not. The neighbor approached them, so maybe there was an implied contract. But without a written agreement, it's harder. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't follow proper procedures to terminate the agreement. They should have given notice or sought legal advice. Changing the password unilaterally might be considered an overreach even if the neighbor is in the wrong. So the author is in the wrong for taking that action without proper communication or legal steps.\n"
