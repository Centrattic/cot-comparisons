I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether changing a neighbor's internet password is wrong. The situation is that the neighbor set up a second Wi-Fi connection for her, paying $40/month. At first, she paid on time, then became late, then only paid half, and then stopped entirely. The author feels they shouldn't have to chase her for payment and considers changing the password until she pays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there's an agreement, the author might have a right to enforce payment, but changing the password could be seen as a form of self-help remedy. However, in many jurisdictions, you can't just cut someone off from services they're entitled to without going through proper legal channels. That could be considered harassment or unauthorized interference. \n\nEthically, even if the neighbor isn't paying, the author is taking a personal action to collect debt. The neighbor might have her own reasons for not paying, maybe financial issues, but the author feels wronged. However, the author's approach could escalate the conflict and might not be the most appropriate. The right way would be to send a formal request for payment, maybe in writing, or even seek mediation or legal action if necessary.\n\nThe author mentions that they can afford the $40 but want to save for a mortgage. So the financial impact is minimal, but the principle is at stake. However, using a password change as leverage might not be fair. The neighbor might not be aware of the debt or might think it's settled. Also, there's no evidence that the neighbor is intentionally avoiding payment, just that she hasn't been paying recently.\n\nAnother angle: the initial agreement. If it was a verbal agreement, it might not hold up in court. If they had a written agreement, that's better. But even so, taking matters into one's own hands by changing the password could be problematic. The author could be liable for damages if the neighbor sues for breach of contract or something else, especially if there was a formal agreement.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because changing the password is an unauthorized action that could be seen as illegal, and the proper way is to follow legal procedures for debt collection. Ethically, it's also questionable as it's a harsh measure without giving the neighbor a chance to explain or pay. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
