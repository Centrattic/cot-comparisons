I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she and her husband have an agreement with their neighbor to provide internet access in exchange for $40 a month. The neighbor started off paying, then got late, then paid half, then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the WiFi password to make the neighbor stop using the internet until she pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they provided a service under an agreement, the neighbor is supposed to pay. But was there a formal contract? The way they set it up was the neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. But in reality, internet service agreements are usually formal between a provider and a customer. In this case, they're acting as the de facto provider. If the neighbor is using someone else's internet without a proper lease or contract, maybe there's an issue. But the author and her husband did agree to this arrangement, so there's an implied contract here.\n\nIf there's no written agreement, it might be more of a verbal one, which can still be binding but harder to enforce. The neighbor isn't paying, so the service providers (the authors) might have the right to terminate the service. But changing the password is a way to terminate the service. However, is this legal? In some places, intentionally interfering with someone's internet access could be a civil issue if there's an agreement in place. Also, if the neighbor is using the internet through a third-party provider, maybe the authors are violating terms of service by sharing their own connection, but that's another layer.\n\nEthically, the authors feel they're being disrespected by not being paid. They are using the neighbor's non-payment as a reason to cut off access. But ethically, is it right to take away the service? The neighbor might be in a position where she can't afford to pay, but the authors argue she's not struggling financially. However, the authors are using it as leverage. Changing the password could be seen as a legitimate way to enforce the agreement, but it's also a form of taking matters into one's own hands instead of going through proper channels like legal action or contacting the main internet provider.\n\nAnother angle: if the internet is technically their own, they can control access. But if the neighbor is a guest user, maybe they have the right to set the terms. But if there's a verbal agreement, is it enforceable? The authors might be within their rights to stop providing the service, but doing so by changing the password without notice could be abrupt. Also, the neighbor might not have agreed to that as a consequence. The authors could have tried other methods first, like sending a formal request for payment, or even involving the building's management if there's a lease clause about such arrangements.\n\nAlso, considering the neighbor's behavior, she's not proactive in paying, but maybe she has her own reasons. The authors might be justified in wanting to enforce the agreement, but changing the password could be seen as a hostile action. There might be a better way to handle it, like sending a written notice or involving a mediator. If the authors take this step and the neighbor sues for breach of contract or something, the authors could be in a legal bind if the court doesn't recognize their verbal agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally and ethically, the authors might be in a tricky spot. They have a valid grievance, but their method of enforcement might be seen as taking the law into their own hands. They could be in the wrong if there's no formal agreement that allows them to cut off service for non-payment. Alternatively, if they have a valid agreement, they might be justified. But since they're using a personal approach to enforce it, it's debatable. The answer hinges on whether the method of enforcement is appropriate under the circumstances.\n"
