I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying the $40/month. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The neighbors set up an agreement where the author and her husband provided a second Wi-Fi connection in exchange for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, then only paid half, and now nothing. The author is considering changing the password to force payment again. \n\nSo, the main question is whether this action is justified. The author isn't in a financial crisis, but they want to save for a mortgage and have kids. They don't want to chase the neighbor for money. \n\nLegally, I'm not sure. They had a verbal agreement, which is binding but might be hard to enforce. By changing the password, the author is using the Wi-Fi as leverage. But is that legal? It might be a civil matter. The neighbor might be in breach of the agreement, but the author's response could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author has a right to be paid, but cutting off the internet could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, the neighbor is the one who initiated the agreement and now isn't fulfilling their part. On the other hand, the author could be accused of not communicating properly first. Maybe they should have sent a formal reminder or issued a final notice before cutting off access. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using a service they control (the Wi-Fi) to collect a debt. That could be problematic because it's a form of self-help repossession, which might not be allowed in all jurisdictions. Some places require legal processes for debt collection. \n\nAlso, the neighbor is using their internet, which is a shared resource in an apartment building. If the author is the one who set up the second Wi-Fi, they might have more control, but others might rely on it too. But in this case, the neighbor specifically arranged the payment for that service. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is trying to enforce a mutual agreement. However, the method might be questionable. The neighbor might argue that changing the password is a breach of their access. But the author might say they're just stopping a service because the neighbor isn't paying. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the legal context, but since the question is about being in the wrong ethically or morally, the author's action could be seen as justified if the agreement was mutual and the neighbor is in default. However, there might be a better way to handle it, like sending a formal notice or involving a mediator. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they changed the password as a direct response to non-payment, maybe not, but the method might not be the best approach. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but with a caveat that they should have tried other methods first.\n"
