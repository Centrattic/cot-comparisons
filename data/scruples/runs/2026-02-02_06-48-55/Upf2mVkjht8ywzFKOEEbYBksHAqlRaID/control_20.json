I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi connection for a neighbor, who pays $40/month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, then paid half up front and half later, and now stopped paying altogether. The author feels the neighbor isn't in financial trouble but is being neglectful. The author is considering changing the password to stop the neighbor from using the internet until they pay what's owed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the possible angles.\n\nLegally, if they had an agreement, the neighbor might be breaching that by not paying. But changing the password could be seen as a form of taking matters into one's own hands. Legally, they might have grounds to withhold service if payment isn't made, but maybe there's a proper process, like sending a notice or seeking mediation. But the user is asking about rightness, not just legality.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a payment agreement. They mentioned they can afford the payments but want to save for a mortgage. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author feels justified in stopping the service. However, cutting off the internet access might be considered a harsh action. The neighbor relies on it, so it could disrupt her, especially if she has children or needs it for work or school.\n\nAlso, the author's argument is that they don't want to chase the neighbor. It's reasonable to expect payment as agreed, but withholding service without some form of notice might be abrupt. Maybe the author should have tried other methods first, like a written reminder or a formal letter. But the user is asking if changing the password makes them wrong.\n\nAnother point: The initial agreement was mutual. The neighbor offered the setup, and the authors agreed. The neighbor's non-payment breaches that agreement. The authors' action is a way to enforce terms. However, the method used (changing the password) affects the neighbor's access. Is there a better way? The authors might be within their rights if the agreement was clear, but the method could be seen as taking the law into their own hands.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The authors could have taken the neighbor to small claims court to recover the debt. Changing the password might not be the best approach because it's a breach of the neighbor's access to a service they were paying for, even if they're behind. But since the neighbor isn't paying, the authors might believe they're justified.\n\nI think the key here is whether the initial agreement was clear. If they had a formal agreement, maybe the authors have a right to withhold service. However, without a formal contract, it's more of a verbal agreement, which might not hold up legally. But the question is about rightness, not legality.\n\nIn terms of morality, the authors are trying to protect their own financial interests. The neighbor isn't fulfilling her part, so they're doing the same. However, cutting off internet might be seen as unfair, especially if the neighbor has children who need it. But the authors have their own children to consider for a mortgage.\n\nI'm leaning towards the authors not being in the wrong because they were operating under an agreement that the neighbor violated. But they could have handled it better by communicating first. However, the action of changing the password is a way to enforce the agreement. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
