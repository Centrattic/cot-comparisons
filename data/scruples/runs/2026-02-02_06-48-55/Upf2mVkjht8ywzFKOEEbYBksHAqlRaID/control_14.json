I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do?\" post is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation is that the neighbor agreed to pay $40/month for internet access, but stopped paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement between the neighbors. The author set up a second Wi-Fi connection under the condition that the neighbor pays. The neighbor initially paid, then became late, then only paid half, and finally stopped. The author is now considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nLegal perspective: If there's a verbal agreement, it's legally binding but might be hard to enforce. However, the author could argue that the neighbor breached the agreement by not paying. But taking matters into their own hands by changing the password might be illegal. Unauthorized access or interference with someone else's internet service could be considered a criminal offense, like computer fraud or theft of services. Also, the neighbor might have a right to access the internet for which they've partially paid, depending on the terms.\n\nEthical perspective: The author is frustrated because the neighbor isn't following through on payments. They don't want to chase the neighbor, so they take action. But ethically, is it right to cut off access due to unpaid fees? If the original agreement was for the neighbor to pay, then the author might feel justified. However, the proper course would be to first attempt to resolve the issue through communication or involve a mediator. Changing the password could lead to conflicts and isn't a standard way to handle such disputes.\n\nPossible consequences: The neighbor might retaliate, or there could be legal repercussions. The author could be held liable for disrupting the neighbor's access, especially if they were the ones who provided the service. Even if the neighbor didn't pay, the author might not have the right to shut them out unilaterally if it's not part of a formal contract with terms for non-payment.\n\nAlternative solutions: The author could send a formal request for payment, involve building management if it's a shared network, or terminate the arrangement through proper channels. Taking direct action by changing the password without notice might be seen as overstepping and could create more problems than it solves.\n\nIn conclusion, while the neighbor's actions are questionable, the author's plan to change the password might be illegal and ethically questionable because it's a direct action without following due process. The correct answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
