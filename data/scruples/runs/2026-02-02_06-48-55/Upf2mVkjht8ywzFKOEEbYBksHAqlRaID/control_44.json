I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she stopped paying for the shared connection.\n\nFirst, the setup: The neighbors (a single mom) approached the authors with an offer to pay $40/month for internet access. The authors agreed, and initially, the neighbor paid. Then she started missing payments and now doesn't pay at all. The authors don't need the money but want to save for a mortgage and have kids. They consider changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the initial agreement, the neighbor's non-payment, and the enforcement method.\n\nThe authors had an agreement. The neighbor agreed to pay, but she's not fulfilling her part. However, legally, if they allowed her to use the internet without a formal contract, it might be hard to enforce. The authors might not have a legal right to cut off the internet even if they had an agreement. Also, changing the password could be seen as a form of self-help, but it's possible that the neighbor might have other ways to get internet or that it's a minor inconvenience compared to the money owed.\n\nOn the other hand, the authors are trying to assert their right to be paid as agreed. They're not causing harm beyond cutting off access. But is cutting off access a valid form of enforcing payment? Maybe, but without a formal agreement, they might not have grounds. Also, the authors are in a position where they can afford to lose the money, but they're saving for a mortgage. They might feel wronged because the neighbor isn't taking responsibility.\n\nThe neighbor's actions could be seen as not respecting the agreement. But the authors' response might be considered a form of revenge or coercion. Changing the password without a clear agreement could be problematic. If they had a contract, it might be different. Since they didn't, maybe the authors are taking matters into their own hands, which isn't ideal. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the authors might feel justified, but the method might be harsh. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on societal norms. If someone breaks an agreement, can you cut off a service they're using? The authors are in a private apartment complex, not a public service provider. So their right to control access isn't in question. But the initial agreement's validity is key. If the neighbor agreed to pay, and the authors allowed her to use the internet, then changing the password to enforce payment might be seen as a reasonable action. However, in some jurisdictions, this might be considered a form of economic coercion. But since it's a WIBTA (Would I Be a Total Asshole) question, the community would consider if the action is unnecessarily harsh or if it's a justified response.\n\nIn the WIBTA community, people often look at whether the person acted in a way that's considerate despite being wronged. The authors are saving for a mortgage, which is a significant goal. The neighbor's non-payment is a breach of the informal agreement. Changing the password stops the neighbor from using the service, which is a direct response. However, maybe the authors should have tried to communicate more or ended the agreement politely. But given the neighbor's behavior, the authors might feel justified. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are enforcing an agreement they had, and the method, while harsh, is a way to get what they're owed without causing harm beyond cutting off a service the neighbor agreed to pay for.\n"
