I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their neighbor's internet password is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor (a single mom) who initially paid for the internet but then started missing payments. The original agreement was that she'd pay $40 a month for the second Wi-Fi connection.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the agreement between the two parties. They had an understanding where she pays a certain amount each month. When she started not paying, the homeowners considered changing the password to enforce payment. Now, is this action justified?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there was a formal contract or agreement that outlined the terms of payment and access, then the homeowners might have a case. But if it's just a verbal agreement or an informal arrangement, things get trickier. Legally, they might not have the right to cut off her access because it's not a binding contract. However, ethically, they might feel they have a right to be paid as per their agreement.\n\nAnother angle is that the internet setup was done with the neighbor's knowledge and consent. By providing the password, she was allowed access under the condition of payment. If she breaches that condition by not paying, then revoking access could be seen as a way to enforce the terms. But the problem is whether changing the password is a fair and legal method of enforcement.\n\nThere's also the aspect of property rights. If the internet is set up in their apartment building, the homeowners have control over that infrastructure. However, the neighbor might have a right to access if the setup was done with the landlord's permission or if it's part of the building's shared resources. But since the setup was done by the homeowners, they might have more control.\n\nBut here's the catch: changing someone's access without notice could be considered a form of taking justice into one's own hands. The proper way would be to first send a notice, give a deadline, and then proceed with changing the password if the payment isn't made. Without a clear legal agreement, this might not be enforceable, and the neighbor could potentially take legal action for cutting off her service without due process.\n\nAdditionally, the motivation here is to get payment. Since the homeowners can afford the loss but want to save for a mortgage, it's their financial decision. However, using a Wi-Fi password as leverage might not be the best approach. They might be better off negotiating again, setting up a payment plan, or even ending the agreement gracefully if she can't pay.\n\nIn terms of community relations, this could create tension. Changing the password might come off as harsh and could lead to legal or social repercussions. It's important to consider the long-term relationship with the neighbor, especially in a small building where interactions are frequent.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow proper procedures (like giving notice, sending a formal request, etc.) before changing the password. Without a formal agreement, their action could be seen as an overreach. However, if there was a clear agreement and they tried to communicate their intent before changing the password, maybe not. But based on the scenario described, the action seems abrupt and possibly unethical or illegal without proper legal basis.\n"
