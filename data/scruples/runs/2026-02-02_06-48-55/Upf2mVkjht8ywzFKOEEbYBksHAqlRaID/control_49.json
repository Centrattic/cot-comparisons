I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she stopped paying for the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the internet, and the author and her husband agreed. So there was a mutual understanding. The neighbor paid at first, then started being late, then only paid half, and finally stopped. The author feels they shouldn't have to chase her for money, especially since the neighbor seems to have money.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about changing the password to enforce payment. Is that justified? Well, legally, if there was an agreement, the neighbor is in breach by not paying. But the author is taking matters into their own hands by cutting off the service. Even if they have a right to stop the service if payments stop, the method might be problematic. \n\nTechnically, changing the password could be a form of self-help. However, depending on the jurisdiction, enforcing a contract through self-help remedies might not be allowed. Usually, you're supposed to give notice and maybe terminate through proper channels. Also, cutting off internet access might be considered a civil issue, but it's possible that doing so without notice could lead to legal consequences if the neighbor sues for breach of contract or intentional interference.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of mutual agreement. The original agreement might not have specified what happens if payments stop. The author might need to inform the neighbor that services will be terminated if payments aren't made, following the terms they agreed on. Without a clear clause about termination for non-payment, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if the neighbor isn't paying.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they can afford to keep the internet, but they want to save for a mortgage. The neighbor isn't paying, so it's a financial burden they could avoid. But by changing the password, the author is directly causing a loss of service. If the neighbor had a contract with an ISP, maybe the author's action would interfere with her service. But since it's a shared setup, the author might have more control, but still, it's a gray area.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about fairness. The neighbor isn't paying, so the author is trying to enforce the agreement. But using a self-help method might be seen as harsh. The author might be better off sending a formal notice to pay or terminate the service, giving her a chance to respond. Changing the password without prior notice could be seen as abrupt and possibly illegal in some places.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they are enforcing the agreement without proper notice or legal process. Even if the neighbor isn't paying, the method of cutting off the internet by changing the password might be considered an illegal self-help remedy. The correct approach would be to send a termination notice and then cut off access after a reasonable period, or pursue legal action if necessary.\n"
