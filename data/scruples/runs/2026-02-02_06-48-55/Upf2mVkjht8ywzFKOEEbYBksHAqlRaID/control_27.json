I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying them. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their husband gave the neighbor a second Wi-Fi connection. The neighbor offered to pay $40 a month. They agreed. The neighbor was late, then paid half, then stopped. The author is considering changing the password to make her pay.\n\nHmm. So the issue here is about a private agreement between neighbors. The author is thinking of taking action by changing the password. The question is whether that action makes the author wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the neighbor agreed to pay and isn't, the author might have a breach of contract. But in reality, enforcing that could be complicated. The neighbor might have a counterclaim if she was promised the Wi-Fi access as part of the agreement. So if the author cuts off the Wi-Fi, maybe the neighbor could argue that she was promised ongoing service for her payments. But the author is saying that the neighbor isn't paying, so cutting off service is a way to enforce payment. \n\nEthically, is it right to cut off someone's internet? It's a service they were given under an agreement. But the agreement might not be formal. The author didn't set up the internet, just shared their existing connection. Wait, the original setup was that the author installed the internet and set up a second Wi-Fi. So maybe the author is providing a service and the neighbor is a customer. If so, the neighbor's non-payment is a breach, and the author has the right to terminate the service. But is changing the password the right way to do that?\n\nBut maybe the author doesn't have a formal contract, just an informal agreement. That complicates things. Without a contract, it's hard to enforce. So the author's action might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Also, the neighbor might have other means to access the internet, but the author is using this as leverage to get payment. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using a threat of cutting off service to collect money. It's a form of self-help. In some cases, self-help is allowed, like if you're owed a debt and take reasonable steps to recover it. But changing someone's Wi-Fi password could be seen as interfering with their property or access. The neighbor might not have any legal claim to the Wi-Fi, since it's the author's internet service. Wait, but if the author allowed the neighbor to use it under the condition of payment, that's a form of a contract. If the neighbor stops paying, the author could stop the service. But maybe the neighbor isn't a third party; the service is provided by the author, so the author has the right to manage access. \n\nHowever, changing the password without notice might be abrupt. The author could have tried sending a final notice, but since they've already asked and the neighbor hasn't paid, changing the password might be their way of enforcing the agreement. \n\nBut is there a better way? Legally, if they can prove the agreement, they could take the neighbor to small claims court. But the author is choosing to take action themselves. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn the Reddit-style question, the user is asking if they'd be the asshole. The answer here is about whether the author is morally wrong. If the agreement was clear and the neighbor is not fulfilling their part, then the author is justified in cutting off the service. However, if there's no formal agreement, it's a bit more gray. The author might be in the wrong for assuming that right without a contract. \n\nSo, considering both angles: if there's an oral agreement and the neighbor isn't paying, the author can stop the service. But if there's no formal agreement, then it's more of a problem. In this case, the neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. So the author might have the right to terminate. \n\nBut maybe the author should have set up a more formal agreement from the start. Since they didn't, changing the password could be seen as aggressive, even if morally justified. Alternatively, if they had a clear understanding, then it's okay. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they had an agreement, and the neighbor isn't holding up their end. However, without a formal agreement, some might argue the author's action is overstepping. But given the scenario, the author's action is a form of enforcing the agreed terms, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
