I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Doing This?) post is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. The situation involves a neighbor who was paying for shared internet but then stopped. The author wants to cut off the neighbor's access until the debt is paid.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the neighbor set up the arrangement and agreed to pay, but isn't fulfilling their part, the author might have a case. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as a form of taking matters into one's own hands. In many places, disconnecting someone's internet, even if they owe money, might not be a legal remedy. They might need to go through formal channels, like small claims court, to recover the debt. \n\nEthically, the neighbor isn't paying as agreed, so the author could argue they're protecting their own resources. But cutting off internet access could be seen as a harsh measure, especially if the neighbor relies on it for work or other essential services. The author mentions the neighbor seems to have money, which might affect public sympathy. \n\nAlso, the original agreement: was it formalized? If it's just a verbal agreement, that might complicate things. The author's decision to take action without prior communication might be seen as abrupt. They could have sent a formal request or letter before changing the password. \n\nThe fact that the author is saving for a mortgage and has children is part of their motivation, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action if it's illegal. The key points are the legality of disconnecting someone's internet, the existence of a valid agreement, and whether there were proper attempts to resolve the issue before taking action. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, utility services like internet are considered essential, and cutting someone off without a court order could be illegal. The author might be in the wrong if they bypass legal processes. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
