I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she stopped paying. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. They agreed to let the neighbor use their internet for $40/month. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, offered half now/half later, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password to make her pay before reconnecting.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, the neighbor is using their service under an agreement. If she's not paying, they might have a right to terminate the service. But the author is doing it without going through formal channels. However, in a landlord-tenant situation, changing access might be tricky. But this is a neighbor in the same building, not a tenant. They set it up as a favor or informal agreement.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce payment. They mention they can afford it but want to save for a mortgage. They don't want to chase the neighbor. The neighbor seems to have the means but isn't following through. \n\nPossible angles: Is changing the password a form of self-help? If there's no formal contract, it's hard to enforce. The author might be within their rights to stop the service since they provided it on their terms. However, cutting off internet could be seen as a breach of the informal agreement. Also, if the neighbor is technically in their apartment and the internet is provided through a shared connection, there might be a gray area about access. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't pursue legal action or mediation. They're taking matters into their own hands. But given the informal setup, maybe it's acceptable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key here is that the agreement was informal. The author can't just unilaterally change the terms unless there's a formal contract. However, since they set up the second connection as a favor and the neighbor agreed to pay, the author might have the right to stop the service when the terms aren't met. But without a contract, it's a bit of a moral judgment. The neighbor isn't a tenant, so there's no landlord laws applying. The author is trying to enforce payment through their own method. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No), because they're trying to enforce a mutual agreement. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as a bit harsh, but considering the neighbor isn't paying, it's a way to enforce the agreement. The author isn't in the wrong because they can't be expected to chase someone to pay, especially if the neighbor isn't meeting their part. The answer might be B.\n"
