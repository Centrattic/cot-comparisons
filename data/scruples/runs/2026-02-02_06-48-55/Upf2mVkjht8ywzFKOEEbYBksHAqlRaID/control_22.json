I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor (the author) changing another neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying the agreed-upon $40/month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The author and her husband set up a second Wi-Fi for the single mom neighbor who offered to pay them. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, then paid half, and now stops altogether. The author wants to change the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is changing the neighbor's internet access a fair response? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I'm not sure about the specifics here. If they provided the internet as a service with an agreement, maybe there's a contract involved. But since it's between neighbors without a formal contract, it might be tricky. Legally, they might not have the right to cut off access unilaterally without a prior agreement that allows that.\n\nEthically, the author feels they've been wronged because the neighbor isn't paying, and they don't want to chase her. The author could argue that they provided a service and the neighbor agreed to pay. However, by changing the password, they're denying a service that was offered. But since it's a second Wi-Fi setup, maybe the original internet provider's terms also come into play. If the main internet is provided by a company, maybe the author isn't technically the provider, just sharing the connection. In that case, cutting off the neighbor's access might be illegal or against the ISP's terms.\n\nAnother angle: the neighbor is using the internet through an agreement. If the author stops providing access, it's a breach of that informal agreement. However, the author isn't charging her through a formal business arrangement, so it's more of a personal agreement. But the neighbor isn't paying, so the author is trying to enforce the payment by cutting off the service. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author has a right to enforce payment if there was a clear agreement. However, doing so by changing the password could be considered unethical or inconsiderate because it affects the neighbor's access to essential services (like internet). Maybe the author should have communicated better first, sent a formal notice, or tried to resolve it through mediation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble, so it's possible the neighbor is being inconsiderate. But changing the password could be seen as a form of punishment without giving her a chance to rectify the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in a position to enforce payments through legal means easily, especially if there's no formal contract. So, they're taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the right approach. They might be in the wrong because they didn't go through proper channels first. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because changing the password is taking a unilateral action without a formal agreement. It's a breach of the informal agreement they had, and instead of following proper procedures (like sending a demand letter, seeking mediation, etc.), they're cutting off access. Even though the neighbor isn't paying, the author's method of enforcement is problematic.\n"
