I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person (the author) and their husband allowed a neighbor to use their internet for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, then offered half now, half later, and then stopped paying. The author is considering changing the neighbor's WiFi password to make her pay the owed amount. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion, choosing between A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, when someone rents a service like internet, there's typically a contract. But in this case, it's a private agreement between neighbors, not a formal service provider. So the terms are based on their mutual agreement. The neighbor agreed to pay $40/month, and the author allowed her to connect. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author might have the right to terminate the service, but they need to consider if there's a breach of agreement.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated because they feel the neighbor is not honoring the agreement. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author is out of pocket. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as a form of taking matters into their own hands. The author might argue that they're enforcing the original agreement, but there's also the aspect of how to handle debt collection.\n\nIn many places, altering someone's access to a service without their consent could be considered a civil issue, especially if it's part of a verbal agreement. The neighbor might argue that the agreement was informal and that not getting a refund or stopping service suddenly isn't handled properly. Additionally, the author could be liable if the neighbor claims that they were misled about the terms or if there was an expectation of continued service.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions that the neighbor doesn't bring up the debt when they meet. Maybe the author hasn't formally reminded her of the agreement or given her a final notice. If the author had sent a written notice or demanded payment before changing the password, that might be more justified. But since they're just changing the password, it could be seen as abrupt and possibly unfair.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's financial situation is a factor. The author says the neighbor isn't struggling, so the failure to pay isn't due to inability. However, the author is using the internet themselves and might be covering the cost, which is a personal financial decision. But legally, if the agreement was to provide internet in exchange for payment, then the neighbor's non-payment is a breach, and the author can terminate the service. However, there might be proper procedures to follow, like giving notice before termination.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might say that the author is justified in stopping the service since they agreed on the terms. Others might say that they should go through proper channels, like sending a formal notice or involving authorities if necessary, rather than taking unilateral action.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right in enforcing the agreement by stopping the service, but the method (changing the password without notice) could be problematic. However, since the agreement wasn't formal, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the author properly communicated the terms and gave the neighbor a chance to pay before cutting off access. If they did, then changing the password could be justified. If not, it might be seen as harsh.\n\nBut the scenario states that the author hasn't chased the neighbor down, just changed the password. The question is whether that's in the wrong. The answer could be A (author is in the wrong) if they didn't follow proper procedures, or B (not in the wrong) if they're enforcing their agreement. I think it's a bit of both, but the answer might lean towards A because changing the password could be seen as a breach of the neighbor's access if the agreement wasn't clear on termination terms. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear that payment is required, then terminating service is acceptable. Since the neighbor agreed initially, the author might have a right to enforce payment. But without a formal agreement, it's tricky. The answer might be B, but the user thinks A. Hmm.\n"
