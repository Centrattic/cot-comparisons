I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password to enforce payment. \n\nFirst, there's an agreement between the two parties. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the internet, which the author and her husband accepted. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, offered half payments, and eventually stopped paying. The author is now considering changing the password to cut off access until payment is received.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there was a verbal agreement, it might be hard to enforce. The author isn't a service provider; they're just allowing access. So, by changing the password, they're effectively revoking access, which could be seen as a breach of the implied contract. However, since it's a private arrangement, the author might have the right to terminate if the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part. But there might be a better way, like sending a formal notice before taking action.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated with the neighbor not paying. They mention they can afford the payments since they're saving for a mortgage. But the neighbor isn't honoring the agreement. Cutting off access might be a direct way to enforce payment, but it's also a bit of a power move. The author might be justified in wanting to enforce the agreement, but using the internet as leverage could be seen as harsh, especially if there's no prior warning given. They should have probably communicated more clearly before taking action.\n\nAlso, changing the password without notice could be problematic. The neighbor might need the internet for work or other essential reasons. The author's action could disrupt the neighbor's life, which raises ethical concerns. Even if the neighbor isn't paying, cutting off access abruptly might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to enforce the agreement, but the method they're using is questionable. They should have given the neighbor a formal notice or tried to resolve it through communication first. Taking unilateral action like changing the password could be seen as overstepping, especially without a clear agreement on consequences beforehand. So, while the neighbor isn't paying, the author's response might be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
