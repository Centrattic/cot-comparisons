I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom.

She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their husband live in an apartment building. They set up a second Wi-Fi connection for the neighbor, a single mom, who offered to pay $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, then started being late, then paid half upfront and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author mentions that the neighbor doesn't seem to be struggling financially since she buys stuff weekly and got a new car. The author feels that they shouldn't have to chase her for the money. They can afford the payments (since they make a decent income and have two kids), but they want to save for a mortgage. Now, they're considering changing the Wi-Fi password so the neighbor can't use the internet until she pays what's owed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, landlords can control the internet service in their property. If the neighbor isn't a tenant but a separate resident, then the author isn't the landlord. However, if the author installed the internet and set up a separate Wi-Fi for her, that's more of an informal agreement. Legally, can the author cut off someone else's internet? That's unclear. But maybe the author isn't the internet provider; they're just sharing their connection. So cutting off the password might be within their rights if they own the router, but it's still affecting someone else's access.\n\nEthically, the neighbor agreed to pay, and now isn't. The author is trying to enforce the payment. The neighbor isn't honoring the agreement. But is cutting off the password a fair response? The author could have tried other methods first, like sending a written reminder, threatening to stop the service if payment isn't made, or even ending the agreement. Changing the password without notice might be abrupt. However, the neighbor hasn't been paying, so maybe the author is within their rights to stop the service as a consequence.\n\nBut there's also the issue of whether this is a legitimate business arrangement. If the neighbor was paying for the service, then the author is providing a service in exchange for money. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author can stop providing the service. However, the neighbor might have a right to access the internet through the building's provider, so changing the password could be cutting off her access to something she's already paying for. Wait, but in this case, the neighbor isn't directly paying the internet provider; she's paying the author for a shared connection. So the author's offering a service (Wi-Fi access) in exchange for payment. If the neighbor stops paying, the author can stop the service. So from that perspective, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nBut there are other factors. The author might have an obligation to give notice, or to follow through with a proper termination process. However, since it's an informal agreement, maybe there are no formal obligations. The neighbor started with good intentions but stopped paying. The author is now trying to enforce the agreement. \n\nOn the flip side, changing the password could be seen as a form of coercion. The neighbor might not have access to another internet provider, so cutting off her access could be problematic. But the author isn't responsible for that; they provided an option, but if the neighbor can't pay, they can't use the service. \n\nAnother angle: the author mentioned that they can afford the payments. So maybe the issue is more about enforcing the agreement rather than needing the money. The neighbor isn't respecting the agreement, so the author is justified in stopping the service. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it. The author could have sent a final notice before changing the password. However, the question is whether the action itself is wrong. \n\nIn terms of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) format, the community often considers intentions and communication. If the author tried to communicate and the neighbor ignored it, then taking action is less of an asshole move. But if they didn't give proper notice, it might be seen as harsh. The author says the neighbor didn't mention owing money when they see her, so maybe the author hasn't tried to communicate again. But changing the password is a direct action. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to enforce a payment agreement, which they're entitled to do if the neighbor agreed. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, there's also the aspect of proper communication and giving notice. But since the neighbor hasn't paid for a while, the author is within their rights to stop providing the service. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
