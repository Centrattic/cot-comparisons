I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40 a month. The neighbor paid initially, then started being late, then paid half up front and half later, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there's an agreement between the two parties, what happens if one doesn't fulfill their part? Since it's a private agreement, maybe the author can enforce the terms. But changing the password could be seen as cutting off a service the neighbor is paying for, but in this case, the neighbor isn't paying. However, the author is also providing the service as part of their own internet, so maybe they can control access. \n\nEthically, the author feels wronged because the neighbor isn't paying despite having the means. The author is not in dire need of the money but wants to save for a mortgage. The neighbor, on the other hand, might have other reasons for not paying on time. The author's action could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might be justified if there was a clear agreement. But is it fair to cut off access? Maybe the neighbor could switch providers or find another way, but since they're in the same building, maybe that's not feasible. \n\nAlso, there's the question of whether there was a formal agreement. If it was a verbal agreement, enforcing it might be tricky. If the neighbor is using the internet without paying, the author could argue they're entitled to stop the service. But changing the password might be a bit harsh. The author could have tried other methods first, like sending a formal request or even sending a payment reminder. If they've already tried that and the neighbor ignored it, then maybe changing the password is a reasonable step.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the neighbor sues for loss of internet, which is a service they were paying for, even if they stopped, does the author have legal standing to cut it off? Or does the neighbor have to go through a different process, like disputing the agreement? The author might be assuming they can enforce the terms by themselves, which could be a risk. Maybe the proper way is to send a notice or involve a mediator, especially in an apartment building where there might be a property manager or HOA rules.\n\nAlso, considering that the neighbor might have valid reasons for missing payments, even if the author doesn't see any signs of financial trouble. Maybe the neighbor is dealing with personal issues. But the author doesn't mention giving them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo weighing the options: the author's action is about enforcing a payment agreement, but the method of cutting off the service might be considered in the wrong if the neighbor has a contractual right to the service. However, since the service is provided under a private agreement, the author might have the right to withdraw it if the terms aren't met. However, without a formal written agreement, it's harder to defend. The answer might lean towards the author being in the right if there was mutual agreement, but maybe the action is too abrupt. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If there was a clear agreement and the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the terms. However, if there's no formal agreement, the author might be overstepping. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if there was an agreement, but the method of changing the password might be seen as reasonable. Alternatively, maybe the author should have gone through a more proper process first. Hmm. I think the answer is B because the author is trying to enforce a payment agreement they had, and since the neighbor is not paying as agreed, cutting off the service they were providing is within their rights. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
