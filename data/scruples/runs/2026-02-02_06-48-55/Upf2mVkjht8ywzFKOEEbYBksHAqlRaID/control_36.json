I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for internet access, and the author agreed. The neighbor was initially paying but then became late, offered half payments, and then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the key points here are the original agreement and the actions taken afterward. The author and husband agreed to the arrangement, which was a mutual understanding. The neighbor's non-payment breaches that agreement. The question is whether changing the password is a justified action.\n\nLegally, when you have an agreement, both parties are supposed to uphold their part. If one party breaches the agreement, the other might have remedies like terminating the agreement. However, in this case, the author is using a self-help method (changing the password) instead of going through legal channels. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author is taking unilateral action without giving the neighbor a chance to repay. They might be within their rights to terminate the service if the neighbor isn't paying, but doing so without notice could be problematic. Also, the author might have a moral obligation to give the neighbor a proper opportunity to settle the debt before cutting off access.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the author changes the password, the neighbor might take legal action for breach of contract or some other claim. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of the implied contract by terminating service abruptly without following proper dispute resolution steps.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor isn't meeting their financial obligations, and the author is trying to protect their own finances for a mortgage. The author isn't in a desperate situation since they can afford to cover the costs, but they want their neighbor to honor the agreement. \n\nHowever, in legal terms, the author might need to send a formal notice of termination due to breach of contract before taking such action. Without that, changing the password could be seen as a hostile act rather than a legal remedy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow proper procedures. They should first attempt to resolve the issue through communication, send a formal notice, and possibly pursue small claims court if necessary. Changing the password without these steps could be considered an overreach, even if the neighbor is in default.\n"
