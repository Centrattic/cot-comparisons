I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live in an apartment, and they've been providing their neighbor with internet access for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, then only paid half, and now stops altogether. The author is considering changing the wifi password until the neighbor pays up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there's an agreement where the neighbor pays for internet access, then the neighbor is contractually obligated to pay. However, changing the password without notice might be seen as a breach of that agreement because the neighbor might have relied on that access. Depending on local laws, the author might be within their rights to stop the service if payment isn't made, but they need to follow proper procedures, like giving notice or terminating the service through official channels if it's a formal agreement.\n\nEthically, the author is frustrated because the neighbor isn't paying and isn't taking responsibility. They feel it's unfair to keep paying the bill themselves when they agreed to be paid. However, cutting off the internet could be seen as a form of punishment that affects the neighbor's ability to access necessary services, especially since the neighbor is a single mom. There might be a better way to handle this, like sending a formal notice or involving the building management or a mediator.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. Did they have a written agreement? If it was a verbal agreement, it might be harder to enforce. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to enforce payment, but the method of changing the password without prior notice could be problematic. It's possible that the author should have followed up with the neighbor through other means before cutting off the service, especially since it's a neighborly arrangement and not a formal business transaction.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's actions\u2014buying things and getting a new car\u2014suggest she has the means to pay, which adds to the frustration. However, the author's children might be affected if the neighbor retaliates, but the main issue here is the unauthorized password change. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of wanting to be paid, but the method could be too abrupt and might lead to further conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor is clearly not fulfilling her part of the agreement, the author's response of changing the password without proper notice or following a formal process might be considered inconsiderate or even illegal depending on the jurisdiction. The ethical thing would be to communicate clearly, give a final warning, and if necessary, terminate the agreement properly. So, the author might be in the wrong for taking unilateral action instead of following proper procedures.\n"
