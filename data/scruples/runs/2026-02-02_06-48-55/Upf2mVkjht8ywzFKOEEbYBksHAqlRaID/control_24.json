I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple set up a second wifi for the neighbor, who initially paid $40/month. Then the neighbor started being late, then paid half up front, then stopped altogether. The couple agreed to this arrangement, but now they're considering changing the password until payment is made.\n\nSo, the main question is about the rightness of changing the password. Legally, I'm not sure, but ethically? They had an agreement. The neighbor isn't paying, so they're withholding service. But the couple says they can afford it and it's not making or breaking them, but they're saving for a mortgage. \n\nIs it fair to cut off the internet as a form of payment enforcement? Well, the couple did agree to the arrangement, so maybe they have the right to enforce it. However, using the internet as leverage might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. They could have taken other steps first, like sending a formal notice, or going through the building's management if there's any. \n\nAlso, the neighbor might have a right to internet access if it's part of the building's amenities. But in this case, it's a separate setup the couple provided, so maybe they have more control. But changing the password could be seen as a form of harassment or causing inconvenience. \n\nThe couple's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have a conversation first. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If they did change the password, it's a form of enforcing the agreed terms, but it's also a direct action that affects another person. \n\nIn some places, disconnecting someone's internet without notice might not be illegal, but it's ethically questionable. The author could be in the right if they followed their original agreement terms, but if the agreement didn't specify consequences for non-payment, maybe they're overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're using a form of coercion without proper legal recourse. Or B (not in the wrong) because they had an agreement and are enforcing it. Hmm. \n\nBut wait, the initial arrangement was mutual. The neighbor approached them, so the couple agreed. If the neighbor isn't paying, the couple has the right to stop the service. However, maybe they should have gone through a more formal process first, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had an agreement and are enforcing it by their own means, which is within their rights as per the terms they set. Unless there's a legal aspect I'm missing, but based on the scenario, it's more about the ethical right.\n"
