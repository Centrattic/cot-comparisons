I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by summarizing the situation. The author and her husband live in an apartment building with a neighbor, a single mom, who started paying them $40 a month to use their internet. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, but then she started being late, then paid half up front and half later, and now she's stopped paying altogether. The author notices that the neighbor isn't struggling financially and even bought a new car. The author is frustrated because she doesn't want to chase the neighbor for payments. The question is whether changing the neighbor's WiFi password to cut off access until the debt is paid is wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal perspective. The author and her husband set up a second WiFi connection for the neighbor under an agreement. The neighbor agreed to pay $40 a month. If the neighbor isn't paying, does the author have the right to cut off access? Legally, if there was a contract or agreement, the author could terminate the service if the terms aren't met. But since this is a private arrangement without a formal contract, the situation might be murkier. The author could be considered a landlord offering a service, but since they're also private individuals, the legality could depend on local laws. However, changing the password might be seen as a form of self-help remedy rather than a legal action.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author is trying to enforce a payment agreement. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed, so the author wants to stop the service until payment is made. From an ethical standpoint, the author might argue that she's upholding her end of the deal by providing internet and has the right to expect payment. On the other hand, cutting off access could be seen as a harsh measure. The neighbor might need internet for work, communication with her children, or other essential activities. The author's actions could disrupt the neighbor's life, which might be considered unethical even if the payment issue is real.\n\nAnother angle is the intent of both parties. The author clearly set up the WiFi as a payment-exchange service. The neighbor started with good intentions but then failed to meet her obligations. The author's frustration is understandable, but using a self-devised penalty (changing the password) without following through on a formal agreement could be problematic. If there was a clear agreement that non-payment would result in loss of service, then the author might have a stronger case. However, since the original arrangement was verbal and informal, the author's action lacks a clear precedent.\n\nAlso, considering the neighbor's financial situation. The author mentions that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble. That makes the non-payment seem like a deliberate choice rather than an inability. The author's decision to cut off access might be seen as a justified response to the neighbor's actions, but it's still a personal enforcement without legal backing.\n\nThe author's justification is that they can afford the $40, but they're saving for a mortgage. They don't need the money but want to be paid as agreed. The neighbor's behavior is untrustworthy, and the author is trying to protect their own interests. However, using a self-help method like changing the password could lead to escalation. What if the neighbor retaliates? There's also the aspect of community relations. Cutting off internet access might create tension and affect the living environment.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, disconnecting someone's internet could be considered a civil issue, but without a contract, it's hard to enforce. The author might face legal challenges if the neighbor sues for breach of implied contract or seeks damages. Alternatively, the author could send a formal demand letter or terminate the agreement through proper channels, which would be more legally sound.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is trying to enforce a mutual agreement. The neighbor isn't honoring her part, so the author is taking steps to stop the service. But the method used is unilateral and lacks legal recourse. The author's action could be seen as reasonable if viewed as a business arrangement, but since it's a private agreement, the lines are blurred.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for being upset, changing the password without a formal agreement could be considered an overreach. Legally, it's a gray area, but ethically, it's questionable because it's a self-imposed penalty without due process. The author might be in the wrong because they're using a personal method to enforce payment without following proper procedures. However, the neighbor's repeated failure to pay is also problematic. The correct approach would be to formalize the agreement with a contract that includes consequences for non-payment, then follow those steps.\n"
