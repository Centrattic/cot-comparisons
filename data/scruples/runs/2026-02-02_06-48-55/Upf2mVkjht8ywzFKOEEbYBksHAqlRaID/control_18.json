I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password because the neighbor stopped paying. \n\nFirst, there's an agreement between the two parties. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the internet, and the author's household agreed. The neighbor initially paid on time but then started missing payments. The author feels they shouldn't have to chase the neighbor for money, especially since the neighbor seems to have the means to pay.\n\nNow, the question is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, Wi-Fi is considered a personal service, and sharing it might not be a formal contract. But there's an informal agreement here. If the neighbor isn't paying, the author might feel they have the right to cut off access. However, doing so could be seen as retaliatory. The neighbor might not have a legal claim to the Wi-Fi, but the author's action could cause inconvenience. Also, if the internet is part of a shared service in the apartment building, changing the password might interfere with the neighbor's ability to access it, even if she's not paying. There's also the aspect of maintaining good neighbor relations. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable, but taking unilateral action might escalate tensions. The neighbor might have her own reasons for missing payments, though the author points out she has the means. The author's main issue is not needing the money but wanting the neighbor to honor the agreement. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is enforcing a private agreement, but the method of enforcement could be seen as harsh. It's a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to uphold an agreement they made, but they might be using a method that's not the most constructive. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. So the answer might hinge on whether the action is justified given the agreement.\n"
