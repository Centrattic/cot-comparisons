I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password after she stopped paying is wrong. The scenario is that they had an agreement where the neighbor pays $40 a month for internet. At first, she paid, then started being late, then paid half now-half later, and then stopped completely. The author wants to stop her access until she pays up, hence changing the password.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the original agreement and the terms of payment. They agreed to provide internet in exchange for $40/month. When the neighbor stopped paying, the authors are considering cutting off her access. \n\nLegally, if there was a verbal agreement, it's still binding, but the enforcement might be tricky. However, in a practical sense, if the neighbor is using the authors' internet, the authors might have the right to revoke access if the terms aren't met. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as a breach of the original agreement. The authors might have a right to expect payment, but taking unilateral action could escalate the situation. \n\nAlso, the authors are not in dire need of the money but are saving for a mortgage. The neighbor, on the other hand, is using the service without paying. The authors might feel that they're being unfair, as they're covering the internet costs alone. However, the neighbor might have thought the arrangement was more flexible or might have had extenuating circumstances. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the authors are in the wrong for cutting off the service. If the neighbor agreed to pay and failed to do so, then the authors are justified in stopping the service. However, there's a social aspect. Changing the password abruptly without clear communication might be seen as harsh. Maybe they should have first tried to discuss the matter, reminded her, sent a notice, etc. But since they already tried and she ignored it, changing the password could be a reasonable step to enforce the agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that taking matters into one's own hands (changing the password) is not the best approach. They should have gone through proper channels, like sending a formal notice or involving building management if applicable. But given that it's a small apartment building and they set up the second Wi-Fi themselves, maybe there's no official management to involve. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the authors are protecting their own property and enforcing an agreement they made. The neighbor is in default, so cutting off the service is a way to enforce the terms. However, if the neighbor is relying on that internet access for important things, that could be a problem. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The neighbor has the means to pay and hasn't shown urgency in settling the debt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the authors might not be in the wrong because they're upholding their part of the agreement. However, the method of cutting off access abruptly might be seen as a bit harsh without prior formal notice. But given the circumstances, it's a reasonable action to take to recover what's owed. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
