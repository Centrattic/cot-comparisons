I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying her share. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband have an agreement with the neighbor to provide internet access for $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time but then started being late, then cut payments. The author is frustrated because the neighbor doesn't bring up the debt and they don't want to chase her for it. The author is considering changing the WiFi password to enforce payment, even though they can afford the cost themselves.\n\nNow, the key points here are the terms of the agreement and the methods of enforcing it. If there's a verbal or written agreement, the neighbor is supposed to pay. However, altering access to someone else's WiFi without a formal contract might be a gray area. Legally, WiFi access isn't a service that's protected in the same way as a contract for a service. If there's no formal contract, the author might not have a legal recourse to enforce payment through cutting off access. \n\nEthically, the author might feel justified because they're expecting reciprocity, but the method of enforcing it could be seen as going beyond what's acceptable. Changing the password could be considered a form of coercion or harassment. Also, the neighbor might have relied on that internet access for her own needs, which could cause her inconvenience or financial loss if she has to get her own service. \n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. If the neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed, but there's no written contract, then both parties might have different expectations. The author might feel they're entitled to the money, but the neighbor might not see the obligation the same way. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can afford the cost, but they're saving for a mortgage and have their own kids. However, the neighbor's non-payment still represents a breach of the initial agreement. But the method of response\u2014changing the password\u2014might not be a proportionate or legal way to handle the debt. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, unauthorized access to someone's WiFi is illegal, so by allowing the neighbor to use their internet in the first place, maybe the author is already in a tricky legal spot. If they didn't set up a formal way for the neighbor to pay for the internet, then changing the password could be seen as a form of theft or denial of service. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're using an informal method to enforce a debt, which isn't legally sound. The correct approach would be to send an invoice, maybe send a formal notice, or involve a mediator. Changing the password without a formal agreement could be considered an overstep.\n"
