I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their husband live in an apartment building and have a neighbor above them. The neighbor, a single mom, approached them earlier this year to get internet access. They agreed to set up a second Wi-Fi connection for her, provided she pays $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, then started being late, offered half now and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author mentions that the neighbor seems to have money since she buys things weekly and got a new car. The author is considering changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password until she pays the owed amount.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. The answer should be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's look at the agreements. They had an informal agreement where the neighbor pays $40/month for internet. The neighbor hasn't paid consistently. The author is considering cutting off access by changing the password. \n\nPossible angles: Legally, if they didn't have a formal contract, maybe they don't have the right to cut off service. But in a neighborly situation, maybe they can set terms. However, changing the password without notice could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's argument is that they don't need the money but are saving for a mortgage. The neighbor isn't paying, which affects their savings. The author might feel justified in enforcing the agreement. On the other hand, cutting off internet could be a harsh measure. \n\nAnother point: the author hasn't tried to communicate directly. Maybe they should have asked for payment first or sent a reminder before taking action. Since the neighbor isn't responding to payments, the author might feel justified, but maybe they should go through proper channels like sending a written notice or involving the building's management if there's any.\n\nIn some places, landlords or building management handle utilities, so neighbors shouldn't be setting up their own internet sharing. If they did it without permission, the author might be in the wrong for offering the service in the first place. But the user's scenario says the neighbor approached them, so maybe it's an informal arrangement.\n\nEthically, cutting off internet could be seen as a form of punishment without due process. The neighbor might not have agreed to that as a consequence. The author could be seen as taking unilateral action instead of seeking a resolution through communication or mediation.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they had an agreement and the neighbor is breaching it. If they can't get payment, cutting off the service is a way to enforce the contract. But without a formal contract, it's a verbal agreement, which is harder to enforce.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to protect their own financial interests, especially for their children's future. But the method of enforcement could be questionable. Maybe they should have given the neighbor a final notice before changing the password.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action might be seen as taking matters into their own hands without proper legal or communication steps. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
