I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering changing the neighbor's internet password after she stopped paying. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband agreed to provide a second Wi-Fi connection to the neighbor in exchange for $40/month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then became late, offered half payments, and eventually stopped paying. The author doesn't want to chase her for the money, so she's thinking of changing the password to cut off the Wi-Fi until payment is made.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether changing the Wi-Fi password is a justifiable action given the unpaid debt. Legally, maybe not. The agreement was a verbal one, and enforcing it by cutting off service without a contract could be problematic. The neighbor might have a right to continue using the Wi-Fi even if she hasn't paid, unless there's a formal agreement. Also, by changing the password, the author is taking matters into her own hands, which could be seen as harassment or a breach of peace if it's a shared network. \n\nEthically, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is trying to enforce a social agreement, but without a legal contract, it's hard to say if that's fair. The neighbor isn't exactly destitute, as she's buying things regularly and got a new car. The author is not in dire need of the money but is saving for a mortgage. However, using the threat of cutting off internet access could be seen as coercive. \n\nAlso, there might be other ways to handle this, like sending a formal request, involving a mediator, or even ending the agreement politely. Changing the password is a direct action that could escalate the conflict and might not be the best approach. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because she's taking unilateral action without a legal basis, potentially violating the neighbor's access to a service they were promised. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
