I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying the agreed-upon fee. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The neighbor offered to pay $40/month for the internet, which they set up a second connection for her. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, then paid half upfront and half later, and then stopped altogether. The author feels they shouldn't have to chase her for payment, even though they can afford the extra cost. They're saving for a mortgage and have kids.\n\nThe main question is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, maybe not. Because the internet is their service, but they allowed her access as a courtesy. But if they set up a second network as part of an agreement, then maybe there's an understanding that she pays. However, that agreement wasn't formalized, just verbal. \n\nMoral standpoint: The author might feel entitled because she agreed to pay. But others might say that changing her access could be seen as taking matters into her own hands. They could have gone through proper channels, like sending a formal notice or ending the arrangement. \n\nAlso, the neighbor isn't paying, but the authors can afford the cost. Maybe they should have ended the agreement earlier instead of letting it slide. But the authors are frustrated and want to enforce payment. \n\nEthically, taking away access could be seen as fair because she agreed to pay. However, it's a gray area. The authors might be in the right to stop providing the service if she's not paying, but doing it by changing the password without notice could be abrupt. \n\nPossible legal advice would be that a verbal agreement might not hold up in court, but if the authors have evidence (like messages or emails) confirming the agreement, they might have a case. Without that, it's harder. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they provided a service with an agreement for payment. If the neighbor isn't fulfilling her part, the authors can stop the service. But maybe they should have handled it differently, like giving a written notice first. Still, the action of changing the password could be justified to enforce payment. However, others might argue that it's taking the law into their own hands. \n\nBut given the context, the authors did agree to provide the internet in exchange for payment. If the neighbor isn't paying, they can withdraw the service. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
