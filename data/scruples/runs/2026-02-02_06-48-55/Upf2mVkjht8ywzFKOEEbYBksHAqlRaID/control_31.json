I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" question is in the wrong by changing their neighbor's internet password until she pays the owed money. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, a single mom, who agreed to pay $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, offered half now/half later, and finally stopped paying. The author doesn't want to chase her for payments and is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the main points are: There was an agreement, the neighbor isn't paying, and the author is thinking about cutting off access by changing the password. \n\nLegally, I wonder if they have the right to do that. If the neighbor is using their Wi-Fi, technically, the author owns the network. But maybe there's a lease or contract involved. However, in many places, you can't cut off someone's internet without a legal agreement. The neighbor might be a tenant, and the landlord handles the internet. If the apartment building's internet is provided by the landlord, then the author isn't the one providing it, so changing the password could be interfering with a service the neighbor is supposed to have. But the question states that the author set up a second Wi-Fi specifically for the neighbor. So maybe it's a shared setup they arranged. \n\nEthically, the neighbor isn't paying, and the author feels it's unfair. The author is trying to enforce payment without confrontation. But is changing the password a reasonable action? It could be seen as a form of economic coercion, which might not be legal. Also, the neighbor might have relied on that internet for daily needs, like work or school. \n\nThe neighbor's actions show a pattern of non-payment, but the author's solution could escalate the conflict. The author might be within their rights if they have a private agreement, but if the internet is part of a landlord-provided service, then changing the password could be against the terms of service. Also, in some jurisdictions, cutting off utilities or services as a form of debt collection is illegal. \n\nAnother angle: the author's husband and wife are providing a service (internet access) in exchange for payment. The neighbor's non-payment breaches that agreement. However, the proper recourse would be to pursue legal remedies, not to take unilateral actions that could be considered a breach of contract or even a tort. \n\nIn summary, the author might be trying to enforce a payment agreement through means that aren't legally sound. Changing the password could be illegal, depending on local laws, and might not be a fair or ethical approach. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because using the internet access as leverage without legal grounds could be problematic. But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. The neighbor agreed to pay, so the author might have a right to terminate the service if the agreement isn't being honored. However, the legality of that action depends on specifics. If the agreement was informal, the author might not have a legal basis to cut off the service. \n\nAlso, considering that the neighbor's child's education or other needs might rely on that internet, the author's action could be seen as harmful. So ethically, even if the author has a right, it's questionable. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could be both legal and ethical. If legally permissible, maybe not wrong, but if not, then yes. Since the scenario is a WIBTA (Would I Be Termed A**hole), the community often considers both legal and social norms. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because using the internet access as leverage isn't a proper way to handle debt collection. They should instead send a formal notice, demand payment, and if necessary, pursue small claims court. Changing the password without legal process could be seen as an a**hole move.\n"
