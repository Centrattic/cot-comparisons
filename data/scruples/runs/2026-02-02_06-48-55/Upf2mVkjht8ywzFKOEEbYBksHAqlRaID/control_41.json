I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the setup is that the neighbors (a couple) installed internet and set up a second connection for a neighbor above them, a single mom. They agreed she would pay $40/month. At first, she paid on time, then became late, then half payments, and then stopped entirely. The couple says she's not in a financial struggle because she buys stuff regularly and got a new car. They don't want to chase her for the money but are saving for a mortgage. They're considering changing the password to get her to pay up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they provided internet access and there's an agreement, even if informal, she's supposed to pay. But changing the password could be a breach of service or could be illegal if they're technically not providing the service anymore. However, if they set up a separate network, then controlling access might be within their rights, but it's a gray area.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness and communication. The couple might feel they're entitled to the money, but cutting off access without prior attempts to resolve the issue could be seen as harsh. Did they communicate the problem? The neighbor isn't paying, but the couple hasn't mentioned if they've formally reminded her or given her a chance to settle the debt. If they've tried to talk to her and she ignored it, then changing the password might be justified. But if they haven't communicated clearly, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's actions: she started with good payments, then became unreliable. The couple is in a position where they can afford it, but they want to save, so they're not in dire need. The question is whether using the password change as a tactic to collect debt is appropriate. Some might argue it's a reasonable incentive, others might say it's a form of harassment or using personal information against her.\n\nAnother angle: the initial agreement wasn't formalized. If there's no written contract, the couple's leverage is weaker. But if it was a mutual understanding, then the neighbor might be expected to honor it. However, in such informal agreements, expectations can be unclear. The couple might not have considered the consequences of her non-payment when they set up the system.\n\nAlso, legal implications: If the internet is a shared resource, changing the password could be altering a service someone else is using, which might infringe on her rights. But if they own the router and set up the network, they might have control over it. However, depending on local laws, providing internet to someone else might create a de facto contract, and cutting access could be a breach of that.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the couple is trying to enforce a prior agreement. If they made it clear that payment is required for access, then withholding access when she doesn't pay could be seen as fair. However, if they didn't explicitly state the terms clearly, they might be overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. Legally, it's a gray area. Ethically, if they've communicated their expectations and the neighbor ignored them, then changing the password could be justified. But if they didn't give her a chance to pay, it's more questionable. The key factors here are whether there was a clear agreement, if the couple tried to communicate the issue before cutting off access, and whether changing the password is a proportionate response.\n\nGiven the details in the scenario, the couple mentions that the neighbor approached them with the offer, and they agreed. The neighbor started paying, then stopped. The couple hasn't mentioned if they gave her multiple reminders or tried to resolve it through communication. Since they are considering changing the password as a way to enforce payment, and given that they are not in desperate need but want to save, it's a bit of a moral dilemma. However, in many cases, such actions without prior formal communication could be seen as inconsiderate or even unethical because it's a personal and direct form of coercion without giving the other party a chance to resolve the debt through proper channels.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using a personal and potentially illegal or unethical method to enforce payment without first attempting to resolve the issue through communication or formal means. Cutting off access unilaterally could be seen as overstepping, even if the neighbor is in the wrong for not paying.\n"
