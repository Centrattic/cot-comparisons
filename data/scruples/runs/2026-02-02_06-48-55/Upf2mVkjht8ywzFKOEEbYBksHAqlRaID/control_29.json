I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author lives in an apartment with a neighbor upstairs. They agreed to set up a second Wi-Fi connection for the neighbor in exchange for $40 a month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then became late, then paid half upfront and half later, and then stopped paying altogether. The author mentions that the neighbor isn't struggling financially, as she often comes home with shopping and bought a new car. The author is now considering changing the Wi-Fi password until the neighbor pays what's owed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreement between the two parties. The neighbor initiated the offer, and the author agreed. The neighbor was paying at first, then started to default. The author doesn't need the money but wants to save for a mortgage, so they want to enforce the payment to maintain the agreement.\n\nThe question is whether changing the password is justified. Legally, if there's an agreement, both parties should honor it. However, the author is taking matters into their own hands by cutting off access. While the neighbor is in breach of the agreement, the author's action might be a form of self-help but could be seen as an act of revenge or retaliation rather than seeking a legal remedy. In many jurisdictions, you can't just shut someone off from services without a legal basis. The proper course would be to first send a formal demand, then if necessary, pursue legal action like small claims court. Changing the password without notice is a breach of the neighbor's access and could potentially be illegal or unethical, even if the neighbor isn't paying. The author might also be violating any terms of service from the internet provider if they set up a shared network without permission.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to enforce a contract, but using a unilateral action to do so might not be fair. The neighbor might not be aware of the change, and there's no opportunity to pay first. The author could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The neighbor's non-payment is a breach, but the author's response could lead to conflict escalation. There might be other ways to handle this, like mediation, before resorting to cutting off internet access.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using an illegal or unethical method to enforce payment without proper legal steps. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
