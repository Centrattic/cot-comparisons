I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be a Terrible Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The neighbors installed a second Wi-Fi connection for the upstairs neighbor, a single mom, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then started being late, then half-pays, then stops altogether. The author and husband are covering the bill themselves but want the neighbor to pay up for their mortgage savings. They're considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Legally, maybe there's an issue. If the neighbor agreed to pay, but there's no written contract, the author might not have the legal right to cut off the service. The neighbor could argue it's a verbal agreement, and the author might be breaching that by cutting off access. Also, if the neighbor is using the service without paying, maybe the author is enabling that by providing the password. Changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The neighbor isn't paying, but the author is allowing them to use the internet. The author might feel justified in enforcing payment, but cutting off the service could inconvenience someone with kids. However, the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part of the agreement. The author isn't the internet provider, so they might not have the authority to cut off access. The right approach might be to communicate, send a formal request, or involve the building's management if it's a shared service. Changing the password could be considered a form of self-help, but it's not the most responsible approach.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's situation isn't specified as being desperate; she has a new car and shops regularly. So maybe she can afford to pay. But the author shouldn't assume that. There could be underlying reasons for non-payment. The author's approach could be seen as confrontational without proper communication first.\n\nIn terms of community standards, people might suggest communicating more, giving clear deadlines, and if unresolved, ending the agreement. Changing the password without notice could be abrupt. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow proper steps. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they're using a unilateral action instead of proper dispute resolution methods.\n"
