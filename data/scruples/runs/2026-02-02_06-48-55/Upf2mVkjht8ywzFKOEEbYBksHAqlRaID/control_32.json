I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor isn't paying the agreed-upon $40/month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author and their husband set up a second Wi-Fi network for a neighbor who offered the setup. The agreement was $40/month. The neighbor initially paid but then became late, then paid half, and finally stopped. The author wants to change the password until payment is received.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to do this. Let's break it down. Legally, if there's a verbal agreement, it's still binding, but enforcing it can be tricky. The author isn't charging a legal fee, so they can't just withhold the internet as a form of collection. However, since the setup was their own network, they might have the technical ability to block access. But ethically, is it right to cut off someone's service without a formal agreement?\n\nThe neighbor isn't paying, but the author mentions they can afford it and it's not a financial burden. However, the author is saving for a mortgage and has children. The neighbor, on the other hand, is purchasing items regularly and got a new car. That suggests the neighbor isn't in financial trouble.\n\nIn such cases, the right approach would typically be to send a formal notice or invoice, maybe even a legal one if necessary. Changing the password without prior formal communication could be seen as taking matters into one's own hands. The author didn't mention if they sent a written reminder or gave a clear deadline. Without that, changing the password might be considered abrupt and possibly harsh, even if the neighbor isn't paying.\n\nAlso, the neighbor might not be aware of how much they owe or might have other reasons for not paying. The author should ensure they've given clear communication and chances to pay. If the neighbor ignores multiple reminders, then action might be justified. But if the author hasn't done that, cutting off access unilaterally could be seen as inconsiderate or even unethical.\n\nAnother angle: the author created a service (Wi-Fi) and the neighbor agreed to pay. If the author is providing the internet as a separate service, they are acting like a service provider. Service providers usually have terms and conditions, including late fees or service termination for non-payment. Since this is an informal arrangement, the author might not have those terms in place. Therefore, changing the password could be a form of service termination, which in a formal context would require notice, but here it's more of a neighborly agreement.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor isn't paying, the author's approach might lack proper communication and formal steps, making the action potentially ethically wrong. The correct approach would be to send a final notice, possibly in writing, and then proceed with action if there's no response. Without that, changing the password could be seen as too abrupt and possibly unfair.\n"
