I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's internet password because she hasn't been paying the agreed-upon fee.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The neighbor, a single mom, approached the original poster (OP) to set up a second Wi-Fi connection for $40 a month. Initially, she paid on time, then became late, then paid half up front and half later, and now stopped paying altogether. The OP argues that the neighbor isn't in financial hardship and even got a new car, so she probably can afford the payment. The OP wants to change the password until she pays up. They don't need the money but are saving for a mortgage and have kids.\n\nThe main question is whether changing the password is justified or if the OP is in the wrong. \n\nLegally, I think the initial agreement was between neighbors, not a formal contract. So the OP might not have a legal right to withhold service in that way. However, ethically, maybe the neighbor breached the agreement, so the OP has some right to enforce terms. But changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of going through proper channels. \n\nThe OP could have first tried to resolve this amicably, maybe through a written agreement or mediation. Since they didn't, and now are considering cutting off service, that might be problematic. Also, if the neighbor is using the internet without permission now, the OP might not be the one at fault. But the initial agreement was to share the internet for payment. If the neighbor isn't paying, the OP might have the right to stop the service. \n\nHowever, using a password change as a form of enforcement without prior communication might be abrupt. The OP should probably first remind the neighbor of the agreement, request payment, and give a deadline. If that fails, then cutting off the Wi-Fi might be a last resort. But the problem is that the initial setup was a private agreement, and without a formal contract, it's hard to know if the neighbor is technically allowed to use the Wi-Fi at all. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, using someone else's Wi-Fi without explicit permission could be illegal, but if the OP set it up with the understanding that the neighbor pays, then the neighbor is part of the agreement. If the neighbor is using it without paying, the OP could legally stop sharing. But the method of changing the password might not be the best approach. They should probably document the agreement and follow proper steps to terminate the service. \n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? If they followed through with changing the password without prior communication, maybe. But if they've already tried to get payment and the neighbor refuses, then maybe not. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances and laws, but generally, the OP might be justified in enforcing the agreement they had. However, the method could be seen as harsh. The answer could be B (No), because they had an agreement and the neighbor isn't honoring it. But also, maybe they should have gone through a better process first. Hmm. Need to decide based on typical ethical and legal standards.\n"
