I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband agreed to provide internet to the neighbor for $40 a month. The neighbor initially paid on time, then started being late, offered half payments, and then stopped altogether. The author doesn't want to chase her for the money and is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, is this right or wrong? Well, legally, when you provide a service like internet, there's usually a contract. If the neighbor agreed to pay, not paying is a breach of that agreement. However, the author's method of enforcing payment by changing the password is a bit of a self-help action. Legally, they might be within their rights to stop providing the service if the payment isn't made, but cutting off the internet without notice could have some issues. For example, the neighbor might have a right to some notice before the service is terminated. Also, if there's a written agreement, maybe the author should follow its terms for termination.\n\nEthically, it's more about fairness. The neighbor isn't paying, and the author is losing money. But the author is also taking a unilateral action without giving the neighbor a chance to settle the debt properly. It might be better to send a formal notice, give a deadline, and maybe even involve a mediator. Changing the password abruptly could lead to conflict and might not be the most constructive way to handle the situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor is not in a financial hardship, which is a point against the neighbor. But the author should consider that the neighbor might not realize the seriousness of the situation or might be having temporary issues. The author's main goal is to get the money owed, so cutting off the internet is a way to apply pressure, but it's a bit of a blunt instrument.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, changing someone's password without their consent could be considered illegal access or tampering. So even if the author has a right to stop the service, the method might be problematic. They might need to go through proper channels, like sending a cease and desist letter or small claims court, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is trying to enforce a payment agreement, which is understandable, but the method of changing the password might be legally and ethically questionable. They might be in the right in wanting payment, but the way they're enforcing it could be wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the method used, even if the intent is justified.\n"
