I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a neighbor's internet password because she stopped paying for the shared Wi-Fi.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The author and her husband installed internet and set up a second Wi-Fi for their neighbor, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, she paid on time, then got late, then paid half up front and half later, and now stopped altogether. The author sees her buying stuff regularly and getting a new car, implying she's not in financial trouble. The author wants to cut off the Wi-Fi until payment is made.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. The author is providing a service (internet) for a fee. The neighbor agreed to pay, but isn't. The author isn't necessarily in dire need of the money but is saving for a mortgage. The question is whether changing the password is justified.\n\nLegally, maybe there's a different perspective, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. The neighbor made a verbal agreement, which might not be enforceable in court, but socially, it's about expectations. The author is trying to enforce payment for a service. On the other hand, cutting off the internet could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The neighbor might retaliate or there could be a breach in the relationship. The author could have tried to address the issue earlier, maybe by communicating directly, sending reminders, or ending the agreement politely. Changing the password abruptly might be seen as harsh. However, the neighbor isn't making payments, so the author has a right to expect that. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are whether the agreement was clear, if the author gave enough warning, and if there's a better way to resolve it. Since the author didn't mention any prior communication beyond just observing, maybe they should have approached the neighbor first. But if the neighbor isn't proactive in paying, the author's action could be seen as self-protecting. However, changing the password without notice could be harsh. The answer might be split, but the community often leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the unilateral action without prior communication. But some might say B (not in the wrong) because the neighbor isn't paying. Hmm. Need to decide based on typical WIBTA responses. Usually, if someone takes actions without discussing, they might be called an asshole. So maybe A. But the neighbor isn't paying, so the author has a point. It's tricky. I think the answer is A because changing the password abruptly might be seen as an asshole move, but some would argue B. Wait, the user wants answer A or B. Let me check similar scenarios. Often, taking away a service without notice is considered an asshole move. So perhaps A.\n"
