I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password to get paid. \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple set up a second WiFi connection for a neighbor, who agreed to pay $40/month. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, but then started being late, offered half payments, and eventually stopped paying altogether. The neighbor seems to have the means since they buy stuff regularly and got a new car. The couple is saving for a mortgage with two kids and doesn't want to chase the neighbor for payments.\n\nThe question is whether changing the password is wrong. \n\nLegally, I'm not sure. They provided the WiFi, and maybe there's an informal agreement, but the neighbor isn't a tenant or under a contract. The couple might be providing a service without a formal contract, so their ability to enforce payment might be limited. However, they're not the internet service provider; the neighbor might be using the internet through their own means, but the setup here is a shared connection. Changing the password could be considered cutting off service, which might not be illegal but could be seen as a breach of an informal agreement. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The couple is trying to enforce payment for a service they provided. They might feel entitled to the money, especially since they're saving for a mortgage. But changing the password without a prior agreement on consequences could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The neighbor might not have known that non-payment would result in losing access. There's also the aspect of communication; maybe the couple should have asked for payment again or set clear terms from the start. \n\nThe neighbor's behavior is inconsiderate, but does that justify the couple's action? If they had a prior agreement where non-payment would result in losing access, then maybe it's justified. Without that, it's more of a problem. Also, the couple's motivation is understandable\u2014they need the money for their own goals. However, using a password change as a collection method could be seen as unfair unless there's a mutual understanding. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might side with the couple because they were asked for payment and the neighbor isn't following through. However, others might say that changing someone's access without notice is too harsh and that they should have handled it through conversation. The couple's approach might come off as harsh, even if the neighbor is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles: Legally, maybe not in the wrong, but ethically, there's debate. If the couple had a clear agreement, then it's okay. If not, maybe they should have given more warnings. But the neighbor isn't paying, so the couple's action is a form of self-help. The answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because they're enforcing an agreement they had, even if it's informal. However, some might argue it's A (wrong) because they didn't set clear consequences beforehand. But given the scenario, the couple is trying to get payment for a service, so B seems right.\n"
