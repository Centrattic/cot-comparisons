I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering changing their neighbor's Wi-Fi password because the neighbor isn't paying the agreed-upon $40/month. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the couple and their neighbor have an agreement where the neighbor pays them $40 for internet access. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, but then started being late, offered to pay half upfront, and then stopped paying altogether. The couple is saving for a mortgage and doesn't want to chase the neighbor for the money. They're considering changing the Wi-Fi password to enforce payment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a verbal or written agreement, the neighbor might have an obligation to pay. However, the couple is the one providing the service, so cutting off access could be a way to enforce payment. But legally, the neighbor might have a claim if they paid for the service. But since the neighbor hasn't paid, the couple could argue they\u2019re within their rights to stop the service. However, in many places, you can't just cut off someone's internet without a court order, especially if it's a service they paid for. But in this case, the neighbor hasn't paid, so the service provider (the couple) might have the right to terminate the service for non-payment. But this can vary based on local laws and how the agreement was structured.\n\nEthically, it's a bit different. The couple is trying to protect their own financial goals. They agreed to the arrangement, and the neighbor isn't upholding their end. The couple isn't making a profit; the neighbor is the one using the service for free after agreeing to pay. On the other hand, cutting off internet access suddenly without notice might be considered harsh. Maybe they should have sent a formal notice or given a deadline before changing the password. But the neighbor isn't cooperating, so the couple is taking action to enforce the agreement they had. \n\nAnother angle: the neighbor isn't in an emergency situation where losing internet would cause harm. The couple isn't cutting off essential services like electricity or water, just internet. The neighbor can still access internet through other means, maybe. But the couple is within their rights as the service provider to stop the service when payment isn't made. \n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, even if you provide services like this, you might need to follow certain procedures for termination. The couple might not be in the wrong if the agreement allowed them to terminate for non-payment. But if there's no formal agreement, they might be overstepping. \n\nIn the scenario, the neighbor approached the couple with the offer, so it's a mutual agreement, but not a legal contract. The couple is trying to enforce a verbal agreement. In such cases, the enforceability can be tricky. But in practice, if the couple is providing the service and the neighbor stops paying, the couple can stop providing the service. However, if the neighbor has already paid for some months, they might have a claim for the remaining time. But since the neighbor hasn't paid, the couple isn't in the wrong for cutting off the service. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they had an agreement, the neighbor isn't fulfilling their part, and the couple is acting to protect their own financial interests. The answer would be B (No).\n"
