I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password because the neighbor stopped paying for the shared connection.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their husband have a neighbor who initially agreed to pay $40 a month for internet access. The neighbor started late, then half-paid, then stopped altogether. The author is considering changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nSo, the key points here are: there's an informal agreement where the neighbor pays for internet access. The neighbor isn't paying as agreed. The author is considering taking unilateral action by changing the password to enforce payment.\n\nNow, legally, in many places, you can't just cut someone off from shared resources like internet if there's no formal contract. Even though the neighbor agreed initially, if it's an informal agreement, the author might not have legal recourse. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially, not just legally.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they have a right to enforce the terms of the agreement they made. However, using a password change as leverage could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might be considered overstepping. The neighbor's property (the internet access) is being controlled by the author, which could be problematic if there's no formal agreement in place.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor isn't paying and isn't being chased by the author, but they want the neighbor to pay. Changing the password is a direct action that removes the neighbor's access, which could be seen as a form of punishment without due process. The neighbor might have reasons for not paying, but the author isn't addressing the root cause of the issue, like discussing why payments stopped.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect communication and resolution before taking direct action. The author hasn't mentioned trying to discuss the issue with the neighbor again, which could be a step before cutting off access. By changing the password, the author is taking a confrontational step that could strain the relationship further.\n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning about needing the money for a mortgage and having two kids adds context about their financial motivation. However, even if the money isn't essential, the principle of an agreement being honored is important. But without a formal agreement, the author's leverage is weaker.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a valid grievance about the neighbor not paying, changing the password is a unilateral action that could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. It might be more appropriate to address the issue through communication or seeking mediation, especially since there's no formal contract. So, the author's action might be considered wrong because it's an aggressive step without proper resolution channels.\n"
