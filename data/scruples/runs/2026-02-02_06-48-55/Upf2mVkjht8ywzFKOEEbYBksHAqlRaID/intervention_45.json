I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom.

She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their neighbor's internet password. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband (let's call them the couple) live in an apartment building. They have a neighbor above them who is a single mom. The couple installed internet and set up a second Wi-Fi connection for the neighbor, who approached them with the offer to pay $40 a month. The couple agreed. Initially, the neighbor paid on time, then got late, then started paying half upfront and half later, and eventually stopped paying altogether. The couple feels that the neighbor isn't in financial trouble, given that she comes home with shopping bags weekly and bought a new car. The couple doesn't want to chase her for the money, and they can afford it, but they're saving for a mortgage. Now, the author is considering changing the Wi-Fi password to stop the neighbor from using it until she pays up. They're asking if they'd be a \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...), which is a reference to the \"Ask a Rando\" subreddit where people ask if they'd be hated for their actions. The user who posted the question thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for changing the neighbor's Wi-Fi password? Answer A for yes, B for no.\n\nLet me consider the legal and ethical aspects here. \n\nStarting with legal: In most places, if you're providing a service to someone else, there's an agreement, even if it's informal. If the neighbor agreed to pay $40/month and isn't, the couple might have some grounds to terminate the service. However, the internet service (Wi-Fi) is technically part of the couple's own service. They might not be the ISP, just sharing their connection. Legally, the Wi-Fi password is their private property. If the neighbor is using their Wi-Fi, the couple can control access. However, the agreement between them is important here. If they verbally agreed to share the Wi-Fi for a fee, and the neighbor isn't paying, the couple might be within their rights to stop sharing. But there could be nuances. For example, if the neighbor is a tenant in a building, maybe there are landlord-tenant laws or building rules that apply. If the building is the one that installed the internet, perhaps the couple aren't the ones who can control access. However, since the couple mentioned that they installed the internet and set up a second connection, it seems like they have control over it. So legally, maybe they can cut off access if the neighbor isn't paying.\n\nEthically, though, it's a different question. The couple is relying on the neighbor to pay, and the neighbor isn't. The couple is in a position where they need to save for a mortgage. The neighbor, on the other hand, is a single mom and might rely on internet for her children's needs. Taking away internet access could affect her children's ability to do homework, stay connected with family, etc. Even if the couple can afford it, cutting off access might be seen as harsh. Also, the couple could have pursued other options first, like sending a formal notice, asking for payment, or even blocking the neighbor's access without changing the password entirely (like MAC address filtering). Changing the password is a direct action that immediately cuts off the service.\n\nAnother angle: The original agreement. If the neighbor initiated the offer and the couple agreed, but there was no formal contract, the agreement is informal. In such cases, one party might feel they can terminate the agreement if the other breaches it. But without a contract, it's hard to enforce. The couple might feel they have the right to stop sharing the Wi-Fi since the neighbor isn't fulfilling her end.\n\nHowever, there's a question of whether cutting off the internet is a reasonable response. Some might argue that the couple should have set clear expectations from the start, including consequences for non-payment. If they didn't, changing the password could be seen as taking matters into their own hands without proper notice. Additionally, if the neighbor is a tenant, perhaps the building's management or landlord should handle such issues, not the individual residents.\n\nAlso, the couple's statement that they don't want to chase the neighbor down might imply that they didn't follow up properly. If they had formalized the agreement with a written contract outlining payment terms and consequences for non-payment, they might have a stronger case. Without that, the neighbor might not have been clear on the seriousness of the agreement.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing Wi-Fi with neighbors can be a common practice, but it's usually informal. Expecting payment for it makes it more like a service agreement. If the neighbor isn't paying, the provider (the couple) has the right to stop the service. But doing so abruptly by changing the password might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the neighbor relies on it. There's also the aspect of how the couple approached this. If they had given the neighbor chances to pay and the neighbor ignored them, then cutting off access could be justified. However, if they just suddenly changed the password without prior communication, that might be seen as harsh.\n\nAnother point to consider is the potential for escalation. If the neighbor feels wronged, she might retaliate in some way, or take the issue to the building management. The couple could be in a worse position if they acted without proper notice or followed-up.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong: If they changed the password without prior communication or notice, that might be inconsiderate. If they had given the neighbor a chance to pay before cutting off access, it might be more justified. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the scenario provided. The scenario mentions that the neighbor stopped paying altogether and the couple doesn't want to chase her. They can afford it, but they need to save for a mortgage. The author's action is to change the password. \n\nSo, legally, maybe not in the wrong. Ethically, maybe yes, because they didn't give formal notice, didn't consider the neighbor's potential reliance on the internet, and acted unilaterally. However, if they believe the agreement was mutual and the neighbor is breaching it, they might feel entitled to stop the service. \n\nIn summary, the answer might depend on the context. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on the information given. The key factors are the informal agreement, the neighbor's non-payment, the couple's right to control their Wi-Fi, and the ethical considerations of cutting off a service without proper notice. Since there's no formal agreement, the couple might be in the right to stop the service, but ethically, it's questionable because they didn't follow up properly. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But in many cases, people might argue that the couple is justified in protecting their own interests and enforcing the agreement they had with the neighbor, even if it's informal. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, others might argue that they should have handled it more professionally, hence A (in the wrong). But in the context of the question, which is a typical WIBTA scenario, usually, the community would consider the ethical and social aspects. Changing the password without notice could be seen as harsh, leading to A. But if the agreement was mutual and the neighbor isn't paying, then B. \n\nLooking at similar WIBTA scenarios, often the advice is to handle such matters professionally, perhaps through formal channels rather than taking unilateral actions. So changing the password might be seen as taking a hostile action, hence A. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
