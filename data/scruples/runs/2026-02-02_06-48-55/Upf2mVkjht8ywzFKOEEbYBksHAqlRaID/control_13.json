I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. \n\nAt first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid \" half now half later\" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like \" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now\". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. \n\nMy husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. \n\nWIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if changing a neighbor's internet password is wrong. The situation involves a neighbor who agreed to pay $40/month for internet access. Initially, she paid on time, then became late, then stopped paying. The author wants to cut off the internet until payment is made.\n\nFirst, the agreement. The couple set up a second Wi-Fi for the neighbor with the condition of payment. That's a private agreement. If the neighbor isn't paying, the couple might feel entitled to stop the service. But legally, are they allowed to do that? Well, the neighbor might have her own way of paying the internet bill\u2014maybe she's using her own provider, but in this case, it's a shared setup. \n\nBut here's the catch: changing the password without notice could be considered a form of harassment or interference with someone else's property or services. Even if there was an agreement, enforcing it by changing the password might not be the proper way. The couple might need to go through proper channels, like sending a formal notice, maybe even involving a mediator or legal steps. \n\nAlso, the couple mentions they can afford the $40 but want to save for a mortgage. The neighbor isn't paying, which is causing some tension. However, the neighbor's actions could be considered a breach of their agreement. But the couple's response\u2014changing the password\u2014might be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, intentionally disrupting someone's internet access could be illegal, especially if it's done without prior warning or legal recourse. Even if there was a verbal agreement, it might not hold up in court, so the couple's actions could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of neighborly relations. Changing the password could escalate the conflict and might not be the best approach. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So, while their intention is understandable, the method of enforcement might be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because changing the password without proper legal steps or prior communication could be considered an illegal act or harassment, even if there's a breach of agreement.\n"
