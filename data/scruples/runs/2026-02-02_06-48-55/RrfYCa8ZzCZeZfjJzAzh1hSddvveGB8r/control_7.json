I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a female college student who called 911 after seeing a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, locked herself in, and called the police. The man turned out to be a friend of a roommate who was supposed to meet him. Now, she's facing backlash for calling the police, with people accusing her of being racist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions were justified. She was in her home, alone, in the middle of the night. The man approached her window, made eye contact, and said \"Let me in.\" Her immediate reaction was fear, which is natural. The key points here are the context of her fear and the potential consequences of her actions.\n\nNext, considering the backlash. People are criticizing her for not approaching the situation differently, like talking to the man first or considering he might need help. However, in a high-stress, potentially dangerous situation, the priority is safety. The police arrived and resolved the issue without harm. The man wasn't armed or threatening, but that doesn't negate the immediate danger she perceived.\n\nNow, the question of racism. The user emphasizes she wouldn't have called based on race. The man was there because of a misunderstanding, not due to his race. However, the backlash points out that calling police on Black individuals can sometimes lead to negative outcomes. The user acknowledges this and doesn't make the comparison she's accused of. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user acted out of fear for her safety, which is a valid reaction. The police handled it and found the man. The backlash seems to be projecting their own views onto her actions, possibly conflating her self-defense with racial bias. She didn't harm anyone, and the situation was resolved without escalation. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she could have tried to verify the situation first, like checking if the door was unlocked or using a light to see better. However, given the time, her alone status, and the potential risk, her immediate reaction was to ensure safety. \n\nSo, weighing her actions against the backlash: she acted in self-defense, faced a misunderstanding, and didn't intent to harm or discriminate. The backlash might be unfair, but she's also aware of the systemic issues and doesn't dismiss them. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911, though she might reflect on the situation for future actions.\n"
