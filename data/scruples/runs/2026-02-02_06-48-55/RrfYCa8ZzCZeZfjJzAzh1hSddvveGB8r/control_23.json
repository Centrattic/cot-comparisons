I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man based on the described situation. I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a female college student who wakes up, goes to the kitchen, and sees a man pressed against the window. They make eye contact, he says \"Let me in,\" and she panics. She screams, locks herself in, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police found out the man was supposed to visit a friend but got the wrong door.\n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism and being overreactive. The user is asking if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLooking at the facts: she was scared, it was dark, she couldn't see well, and she felt threatened. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety. She didn't know his intentions and couldn't verify if he was a threat. The police later confirmed it was a mistake, but at the time, her reaction was based on the immediate danger she perceived.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she didn't try to communicate first. But given the situation\u2014late at night, a man at her window saying \"Let me in\" without clear context\u2014it's understandable she felt unsafe. She didn't act with malice, just fear. Also, she's not denying the potential for overreaction and acknowledges the racial implications others are pointing out.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is pointing out that calling the police on a black man can have serious consequences and that there's systemic racism in police interactions. But the author's intent wasn't to discriminate; she's clear she would have called regardless of his race. The police response resolved it without harm.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: while her actions were based on fear and she wasn't in immediate physical danger (the man wasn't inside), her reaction was a response to a perceived threat. In such situations, people often act on instinct. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Since she didn't have malicious intent and the situation was ambiguous, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong). But there's a nuanced aspect where she might be criticized for not considering alternatives, but given the circumstances, it's more about self-preservation.\n"
