I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The situation is that the author, a female college student, saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and now faces backlash.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was scared, in a vulnerable situation, and acted out of fear for her safety. She didn't know the man, couldn't describe him, and was unsure if the window was locked or if others were involved. The police later found out he was a friend who got confused. \n\nNow, considering the backlash: people are accusing her of racism, saying she shouldn't have called 911. The author acknowledges that Black people face different dangers with police, but she didn't compare her experience. The question is whether she was wrong to call 911 because of his race.\n\nIn such situations, people often react based on fear and immediate threats. The law allows calling emergency services if someone feels threatened, regardless of the person's race. The author's actions were driven by fear for her safety, not malice. However, in hindsight, she might realize that there were alternative steps (like contacting the building's security first), but in the moment, panic can cloud judgment. \n\nBut the main issue is the race aspect. The author emphasizes that she would have called 911 regardless of race. The backlash is questioning her intent, suggesting she's part of systemic racism. However, the author didn't act with intent to harm or discriminate; she acted out of fear. The police response resolved the situation without harm. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions were a reaction to a perceived threat. While the backlash is harsh, her intent wasn't malicious. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong for calling 911. The answer would be B.\n"
