I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM. Her roommates were either away or asleep. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found the man, who was supposed to meet a friend but got confused. Now she's facing backlash from classmates, being called racist and accused of being a \"Break in Barbie.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable situation: alone at night, seeing a man at her window. Her immediate reaction was fear and self-preservation. It's natural to be scared when someone approaches your window unexpectedly, especially if you don't know who it is. She didn't interact with him, just made eye contact and he said \"Let me in.\" That could be alarming. She didn't approach him, she ran for safety and called emergency services. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash she's facing is about the color of the man's skin. People are suggesting she wouldn't have called the police if it were a white person, implying racism. But the author argues she would have called regardless of the person's race. The police found out it was a misunderstanding, but that doesn't mean her initial fear was unfounded. She didn't know that at the time.\n\nThe key point is whether her reaction was reasonable. In many places, if someone is at your window in a suspicious manner at night, calling the police is a standard precaution. She had no reason to trust the man, didn't know if he was armed, and couldn't verify if others were around. Her actions led to the police preventing a potential break-in (since he was supposed to meet someone and got confused). \n\nHowever, the backlash is also valid because people are rightly concerned about racial profiling and the disproportionate impact on black individuals when calling police. The author didn't know the man's intentions, but the fear led her to take a serious action. The question is whether her fear was justified. In her mind, yes, because she felt threatened. But in hindsight, others might see it as an overreaction, especially since it turned out to be a mistake.\n\nBut the core of the issue is the immediate threat perception. If someone is at your window telling you to let them in at 2 AM, it's reasonable to be scared and call for help. The police did respond and resolved the situation. The author's intention wasn't to harm the man, just to protect herself. The backlash is more about the societal context of racial bias, but she didn't act with intent to discriminate. \n\nSo, considering both sides: Her actions were driven by fear for her safety, which is understandable. The police response was appropriate. However, the fact that the person was black and the accusations of racism are part of a larger societal issue. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she acted out of fear and didn't have malicious intent, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the backlash is also highlighting valid concerns about racial profiling. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because her actions were a reaction to an immediate perceived threat, even if it turned out to be a misunderstanding. The responsibility isn't solely on her to not call the police in such a situation. However, it's also important to acknowledge the concerns raised about racial bias. But given the context of her fear and the outcome without any harm, the answer would be B.\n"
