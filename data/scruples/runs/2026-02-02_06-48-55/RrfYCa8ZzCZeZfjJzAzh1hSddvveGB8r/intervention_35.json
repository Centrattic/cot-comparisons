I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. They want a simple A or B answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man outside her window at 2 AM. She was scared, locked herself in, called the police. The man turned out to be a friend looking for a door. People are accusing her of racism.\n\nSo, the main points: She was in a scary situation, acted on fear, didn't know the man, and called the police out of precaution. The backlash is harsh, with people saying she should have talked to him first. But others might argue that in her state of fear and not knowing the situation, calling 911 was reasonable.\n\nNow, considering societal context: There's a lot of discussion about racial profiling and the dangers Black people face with police. The author didn't have any reason to suspect this was about race\u2014she just saw a stranger at her window in the middle of the night. But because the person was Black, the reaction is more intense, which is a real issue.\n\nOn one hand, her actions were out of fear for safety. On the other, calling 911 on someone for knocking on a window, even if mistaken, can have serious consequences. But she didn't know the man had a legitimate reason; she couldn't be sure. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she was genuinely scared and there's no indication she acted with racial intent, maybe not. But the backlash points out that she didn't ask for help or try to communicate, which could have been a safer approach. However, in a panic, that's not always possible.\n\nI think she's not in the wrong because she was in a dangerous situation and acted on instinct. The wrong here isn't entirely hers. But some might argue she should have considered other possibilities first. However, given the circumstances and her state of mind, B (not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
