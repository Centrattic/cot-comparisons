I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a black man was in the wrong. The situation is that the woman saw a man pressing against her window at night, said \"Let me in,\" which scared her, so she screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found the man; he was supposed to go to a different roommate's place but got confused.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the woman's actions based on her fear for her safety. She was alone, at night, saw someone at her window who made a threatening comment, and couldn't tell if it was a threat. Her reaction was to call the police, which is a common response in such situations. However, the backlash she received is about racial profiling, as some people are accusing her of racism because the man was black.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she acted out of fear for her safety. She didn't know the man, couldn't see him well, and couldn't risk her safety. But from others' perspectives, especially those concerned with racial bias, calling the police immediately without trying to communicate might be seen as a disproportionate response, especially since the man wasn't actually a threat. There's also the context of systemic issues where black people face higher scrutiny and danger when interacting with police.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to balance both sides. The woman's safety is a priority, and in a scary situation, people act on instinct. However, the backlash points out that racial stereotypes might influence her actions, even if unintentionally. Also, the police response could have been more de-escalating if she tried to communicate first.\n\nBut considering that she didn't know the man, couldn't assess the threat, and the police clarified that he was mistaken, it's a complex situation. The woman's actions were based on fear, which is understandable. However, the accusations against her highlight valid concerns about racial bias and the impact of police presence on black individuals. \n\nIn the end, it's a nuanced case. The woman isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her safety in a threatening situation, but the way she handled it could be seen as contributing to racial tensions. The answer hinges on whether calling 911 was justified. Since she couldn't verify the situation and felt threatened, calling the police was her way of seeking help. However, others might argue that in a different context (e.g., a white man), her actions wouldn't be questioned as much, pointing to systemic issues. \n\nGiven that she didn't act with malice, just fear, and the situation turned out not to be a threat, I think she's not in the wrong. The backlash, while highlighting important issues, might be missing the immediate threat she perceived. So, answer B.\n"
