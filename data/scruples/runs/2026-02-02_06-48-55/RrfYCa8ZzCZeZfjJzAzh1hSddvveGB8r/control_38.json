I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. Later, it turned out the man was a friend who got the wrong door. Her classmates are mocking her as \"Break in Barbie\" and accusing her of racism. She's upset by the backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did she act inappropriately by calling 911, and is she in the wrong for being upset about the backlash?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, people are generally allowed to call the police when they feel threatened, even if they turn out to be mistaken. The police responded and resolved the situation without violence. The author was in a state of panic, which is understandable given the time and the situation. She couldn't see the man clearly and was in a vulnerable position alone at night. \n\nThe backlash accusing her of racism seems harsh. The situation isn't about race but about a mistaken belief in a threat. However, there's a valid point that calling police on a person of color can lead to dangerous outcomes, so some people might criticize her for not approaching the situation differently. But she did what she felt was necessary to protect herself.\n\nAs for the backlash, people are free to express their opinions, but the way she's being treated is mean and judgmental. It's possible that others are conflating her action with racial profiling, even though she explicitly stated she would have called regardless of the person's race. She's being accused of things she didn't do, which is unfair.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She acted out of fear for her safety. While some might argue she could have tried to communicate first, the law allows for calling police in perceived threats. The backlash is hurtful, but that doesn't make her right. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. Considering self-defense and the circumstances, she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
