I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a female college student. She wakes up at 2 AM, goes to the kitchen for a snack, sees a man pressed up against the window. They make eye contact, he says \"Let me in.\" She screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, texts her roommate. The police find the man, who was supposed to meet a friend but got the door wrong. Her classmates are calling her names, accusing her of racism, saying she should have talked to him first. They question her actions based on his race. She feels hurt by the backlash and is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her actions. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw someone at the window. She was scared, which is a valid reaction. She didn't know if he was a threat. The police confirmed he was there by mistake. But people are criticizing her for calling 911 because he's black. Are they conflating her fear with racism?\n\nOn one hand, she had a legitimate fear for her safety. When someone is at your window uninvited and says \"Let me in,\" it's understandable to feel threatened. She didn't know if he was armed or if others were nearby. Calling 11 is a standard response to a potential break-in. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is pointing out that she didn't try to communicate first, didn't wait, and that her reaction might have been influenced by racial bias. Some might argue that in a different scenario, like a white man, she might not have reacted the same way. But she claims she would have called regardless of his race. However, the fact that people are making that comparison is part of the issue.\n\nAlso, the police found out he had a friend who was expecting him, so it was a misunderstanding. But should she have handled it differently? If she had approached him to talk, maybe she could have de-escalated the situation. But what if he had been a real threat? She might have put herself in danger. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were reasonable.Fear for personal safety is a powerful motivator. She took steps to protect herself: screaming, locking herself in, calling 911. The police handled it, and it turned out to be a mistake. But the critics are using this to accuse her of racism, which is a serious charge. She doesn't seem to have intent to discriminate; she's scared and acting on instinct.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, calling 911 when you perceive a threat is a common response. However, societal issues around race and policing complicate this. The backlash reflects real tensions where people of color may face adverse consequences from police interaction. But the author didn't know about his intent and was acting in fear. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If we consider her actions based on fear and self-preservation, maybe not. But if the criticism is valid that her race-based judgment was a factor, then there's a problem. However, she doesn't claim racial intent. The police didn't find any issue with her call. The main conflict is between her perceived threat and societal concerns about racial profiling. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. Her actions were based on fear for her safety, and she followed standard procedures by calling 911. The backlash might be valid in raising awareness about racial tensions, but her individual action in that moment was a reaction to a perceived threat she couldn't confirm. She's not necessarily at fault for her fear, though she can reflect on the broader implications.\n"
