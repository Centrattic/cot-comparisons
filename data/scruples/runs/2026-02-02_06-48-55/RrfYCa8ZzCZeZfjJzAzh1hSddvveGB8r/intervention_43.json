I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who called 911 on a black man was in the wrong. The situation is that the woman saw a man at her window, got scared, called the police, and then faced backlash from classmates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. She was alone, scared, and in her home. She describes it as one of the scariest experiences. She didn't turn on lights to avoid waking her roommate, and when she made eye contact, he said \"Let me in.\" Her reaction was to scream, lock herself in, and call 911. The police found out that the man was supposed to be there, but got confused. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From her side, she was acting in self-defense. Home security is a priority, and when someone is outside your window, especially at night, it's natural to be scared. She didn't know if there were others or if he was a threat. Her actions were based on fear and trying to protect herself and her roommate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she didn't know the man, didn't confront him directly, and that calling the police could lead to negative outcomes for the person, especially if he's a person of color. The backlash she received includes accusations of racism, which complicates things. However, she mentions she didn't see his race as a factor in her decision, just the situation. \n\nThe key points here are the intent behind her actions. She didn't call because of his race, but because she felt threatened. The police investigation cleared that he wasn't a criminal, but her reaction was based on her perception of danger at the time. It's possible that she could have considered other options, but given the fear and the situation, her instinct was to call 911. \n\nAlso, the social backlash is harsh. People are making comparisons to racism, but she didn't intend to target him. However, the impact of calling police on a person of color can't be ignored, even if unintended. There's a balance between personal safety and societal issues here. \n\nI need to determine if her actions were wrong. In terms of legal and safety aspects, calling 911 when you feel threatened is a standard response. However, the context of systemic racism means that such calls can have disproportionate consequences. The author acknowledges this in her own reflection, saying she can see how it might be an overreaction. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. On one hand, she acted on fear for her safety. On the other, the outcome led to a person being involved with police unnecessarily. But given that she had no way of knowing his intentions and the circumstances were genuinely scary, it's debatable. \n\nThe possible answer is B (not in the wrong) because her actions were based on a reasonable fear for her safety, even if the outcome was a misunderstanding. The backlash might be harsh, but her initial reaction is justified in the context of self-defense. However, she could have considered alternative actions, like checking if it was someone she knew, but that's not always possible in fear-induced situations.\n"
