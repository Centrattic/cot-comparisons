I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man and for being upset about the backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a female college student who encountered a man outside her window at 2:00 AM. She was scared, called the police, and later found out that the man had a legitimate reason (his friend's door was supposed to be unlocked). The backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism and overreaction.\n\nThe core issue here is whether calling the police in this situation was inappropriate because the man was Black. The user wants to know if the author is at fault (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, most people would say that if someone feels threatened and calls the police, that's their right. Especially in the situation where she felt immediate danger. She did what she could to protect herself and her roommates. The police responded and found the man, so the outcome wasn't a false alarm in the sense that there was someone there who shouldn't have been.\n\nHowever, social context is important here. There's a real issue with racial profiling and the disproportionate use of force against Black individuals by police. The author is white, and the man is Black. The backlash she's experiencing might stem from people's concern about how such calls can contribute to the policing of Black communities, even if unintentionally. But in her case, she didn't know the man was Black before calling 911. She said she would have called regardless of his race because of fear. \n\nThe question is whether her action was wrong. If she genuinely feared for her safety, then from a self-defense perspective, she's not in the wrong. But from the social justice angle, some might argue that she should have tried to de-escalate without involving police. However, given the time, the situation (a person at the window, making eye contact, asking to be let in), her fear is understandable. \n\nThe backlash she's receiving, though, is about people accusing her of racism. But she didn't act based on his race, as per her own statement. The people questioning her might be overgeneralizing her actions, especially given the current societal tensions around police and race. \n\nThe author is also upset about the backlash. She's being accused of things she didn't do, like being racist. So, is she in the wrong for being upset? Probably not. People have the right to feel upset when unfairly criticized. She acknowledges the other side's perspective and doesn't compare her experience to the systemic issues faced by Black people. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Her initial action of calling 911 was a response to fear for her safety, which is a valid reason. The backlash she's facing is harsh and possibly unfair, given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
