I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is a female college student who called 911 because she saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, didn't turn on the lights to avoid waking her roommate, and when the man said \"Let me in,\" she panicked. The police found out that the man was supposed to be in a neighboring unit but got confused due to similar doors. Now, classmates are mocking her and accusing her of racism for calling 911 on a Black man.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was alone, in the middle of the night, in a potentially unsafe situation. The man was at her window, which is a private space, and made a threatening statement. Her actions\u2014screaming, hiding, calling 911\u2014are typical responses to fear for one's safety. The key point here is that her decision was based on fear, not the man's race. She mentions she wouldn't have cared about his color; she would have called regardless.\n\nHowever, the backlash is about the perception of racism. Even if her intent wasn't racial, the act of calling 911 on a Black man might be seen as contributing to systemic issues, especially if the person wasn't a threat. The police didn't find any weapons, and the man was just a friend who got lost. But from her perspective, she couldn't know that at the time. In the dark, without being able to see or verify, her fear is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong in calling 911. Legally, if someone is trespassing or attempting entry without permission, calling the police is appropriate. But socially, there's a debate. Some might argue that she should have tried to communicate first, but when someone is at your window saying \"Let me in,\" that's not a typical situation where you just chat. It's more about safety. \n\nOn the other hand, the fact that it was a misunderstanding and the man was a friend might lead others to think she overreacted. However, given the time and the circumstances, her reaction seems justified. The people accusing her of racism might be conflating her isolated action with broader racial profiling, which is a sensitive issue. She didn't know the man's race was a factor; she just acted on fear. \n\nAlso, the user is upset about the backlash. Is that justified? Well, she didn't intend to be racist, and the situation was scary. Being criticized harshly for her fear and safety measures, even if there's a misunderstanding later, is tough. But the question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nI think the main factors are her fear for safety and the immediate need to protect herself. Her actions were based on self-preservation. Even though the outcome was a misunderstanding, the responsibility might not be entirely on her. The man was indeed at her window, which is a red flag. She didn't have the means to verify his intentions safely. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She acted in self-defense, and the backlash, while valid in some contexts, shouldn't negate her right to feel threatened and seek help. The people criticizing her are making assumptions about her motives and actions, which might not be fair given the circumstances.\n"
