I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is that the author saw a man at the window at 2 AM, which scared her. She called 911, and later found out that he was supposed to be at a similar-looking door. People are accusing her of racism for calling 911 based on his race.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from her perspective. She was alone, scared, and in the middle of the night. She didn't know who it was, and her immediate reaction was to protect herself. She didn't have time to assess the situation fully, which is understandable. Her actions were driven by fear and self-preservation.\n\nThen there's the backlash she's facing. The question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she acted out of fear, which many people can relate to. On the other hand, some might argue that she should have tried to communicate first. But in a high-stress situation, especially in the dark, it's hard to tell if someone is a threat. Also, the color of his skin shouldn't matter; she would have called regardless of race. However, the backlash is pointing out the disproportionate response to people of color, which is a real societal issue.\n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're conflating the situation with racial bias. The author herself mentions that she doesn't compare her experience to that of black people and acknowledges their greater challenges. She didn't consider the racial aspect when she called 911, but the situation highlights a broader problem where people of color are often profiled.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Legally, she might not be; self-defense and reporting a potential threat could be justified. But socially, people are sensitive to how such actions affect marginalized communities. The problem arises when fear leads to calling police on someone of color, even if the reason is self-defense. It's a complex issue where personal safety and systemic racism intersect.\n\nIn conclusion, while her actions might be understandable in her context, the backlash is also valid because of the racial implications. However, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" because she acted out of fear without malicious intent. But the situation is nuanced, and both perspectives have merit.\n"
