I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is that the woman saw a man at her window at 2 AM, scared, called the police, and there was backlash from classmates.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. She was alone in the house, it was late at night. She saw someone pressing against the window, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" That's pretty scary. She reacted by screaming, hiding in the closet, calling 911, and texting her roommate. The police found the man, who was actually there by mistake with a friend expecting the door unlocked. \n\nThe key points here: her safety was the priority. In a situation where someone is at her window, especially at night, and she's scared, calling 911 is a natural reaction. She couldn't see him well, couldn't confirm who he was or what he wanted. She didn't know the doors were similar or that he was a friend. \n\nNow, the backlash comes from classmates accusing her of racism. They say she should have talked to him first, asked what he wanted. But when you're in fear for your safety at night, the priority is to get help. The police arrived and resolved the situation without harm. \n\nShe mentions she didn't know his race when calling the police, but later faced accusations. The question is whether she was in the wrong. From a safety perspective, she wasn't wrong to call 911. The police were able to handle it. The backlash is more about how her actions were perceived, but her intent was self-protection.\n\nHowever, she also acknowledges that calling 911 might be seen as an overreaction in hindsight. She didn't know he wasn't a threat, but how could she have known? She was scared, and that's a valid reaction. The other side is that people of color face disproportionate harm from police, so calling 911 can have serious consequences. But the man didn't end up harmed, and she didn't know his race at the time.\n\nSo, considering both sides: her safety is important, and she acted out of fear. The backlash is harsh, but she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety. However, maybe there's a middle ground where she could have explained the situation better. But given the circumstances, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. The answer is B (No).\n"
