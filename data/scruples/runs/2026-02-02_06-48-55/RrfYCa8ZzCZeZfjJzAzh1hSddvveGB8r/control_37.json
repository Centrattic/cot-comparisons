I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student calling 911 on a black man who was outside her window. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. She was alone at night, saw someone pressed against the window. She was scared, screamed, called police. The police found out the man had a friend who was expecting him and there was a mix-up with the doors. Now she's facing backlash for calling 911, with people accusing her of racism.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe woman was in a situation where she felt threatened. She didn't know who it was, couldn't see clearly, and acted out of fear. On the other hand, critics are saying she didn't try to communicate first, that calling 911 was an overreaction, especially considering the race of the person involved. \n\nI should consider her intentions. She called 911 because she was scared, not because of the man's race. She mentioned she would have called regardless of his color. Also, the context of police interactions with Black people is important. Even if her actions were driven by fear, the impact of such a call can be harmful, especially if it leads to unnecessary police involvement. \n\nHowever, she was in a vulnerable position. She didn't know if the man was a threat, and her safety was a priority. The police did determine that there was a mix-up, so maybe her action wasn't unfounded. The backlash might be part of a broader societal issue where people are more critical of calls to police in such scenarios, especially when race is involved. \n\nBut the main point is whether she's in the wrong. If she acted out of genuine fear for her safety, then it's understandable. However, the backlash might be valid because of the systemic issues with how communities of color interact with police. But the question is whether she's at fault. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. Her actions were based on fear and self-defense, which is a valid reaction. The backlash is about the broader societal implications. So, from a legal standpoint, she might not be in the wrong because she felt threatened. However, in terms of social responsibility, there's a debate. But the answer here is based on her actions versus being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she acted out of fear and the situation was ambiguous. She didn't have the means to verify the man's intentions and was prioritizing her safety. Even though the outcome showed it was a mix-up, her reaction was justifiable at the time.\n"
