I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student calling 911 after seeing a black man pressing against her window and saying \"Let me in.\" She was scared and locked herself in, then called the police. The police found out the man was supposed to meet a friend but got the door wrong. Now, she's getting backlash for being racist.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: she was alone, scared, couldn't see the person well, and reacted out of fear for her safety. She didn't know the man was black when she called 911, as stated in her reasoning. The police confirmed the man didn't have a weapon and was just mistaken. \n\nThe other side is the backlash she's receiving. People are accusing her of racism, using phrases like \"Break in Barbie\" and suggesting she should have talked to him first. They're comparing her actions to systemic issues, which is a fair point because of the real issues Black people face with police.\n\nThe key points here are: Was her fear justified? She couldn't see the man's face, he was at her window saying \"Let me in,\" which is a scary situation. Her reaction was to scream, hide, and call 911. The police didn't find any weapons. \n\nOn one hand, her fear for her safety is valid. She didn't have any reason to trust that the man wasn't a threat. On the other hand, the backlash is pointing out that she didn't engage with the situation before calling the police, and that the man was not a threat. Also, the race of the individual is a sensitive factor here, given the context of police interactions with Black people.\n\nThe author mentions she didn't know his race when she called 911, which is important. That suggests her reaction wasn't based on race but on circumstances. However, the fact that the person was Black and she's facing accusations of racism complicates things. \n\nBut in terms of whether she's in the wrong for calling 911\u2014legally, she wasn't breaking any laws. She had a right to feel unsafe and call for help. However, from a social justice perspective, the incident might be seen as contributing to racial profiling, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe author is also upset about the backlash. She's trying to balance her fear with understanding others' perspectives. She's not comparing her experience to that of Black individuals but acknowledges the comparison is being made. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. Legally, she's not wrong for calling 911 in a perceived threat. Emotionally, her fear is valid. But socially, the backlash is about the impact of such actions on marginalized communities, even if unintended. The person might not be in the wrong for her actions, but the backlash is rooted in real societal issues. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because her actions were based on fear for her safety, not racial intent. However, the complexity here is that while she's not in the wrong for calling 911, the situation highlights the broader societal tensions around race and police interactions. The key is that her intent wasn't racist, but the outcome and perception are important. The answer depends on whether the question is about legal rightness or social responsibility. Given the context, the author's actions were a self-defense measure, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
