I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her calling 911 on a Black man who was near her window. She was scared, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in,\" leading her to panic and call the police. The police later said he was supposed to be at a nearby unit and got confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, you can call the police if you feel threatened, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. Her safety and fear for her safety are important. She didn't have a good look at him, couldn't describe him, and was in a vulnerable situation late at night. It's reasonable for someone to act in fear and seek help.\n\nBut then there's the social context. The backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism. The person she called 911 on is Black, and some people are suggesting she would have acted differently if he were white. That's a sensitive issue. However, the key point is that her action was based on fear of a potential threat, not the person's race. She even acknowledges that she could have overreacted and isn't comparing her experience to systemic racism.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she's probably not. She had a legitimate reason to feel in danger. However, the backlash is highlighting the racial tensions and the disproportionate police response to Black individuals. Even if her intent wasn't racist, the outcome could still be problematic if it reflects implicit bias.\n\nBut the author did express understanding of the other side, acknowledging that Black people face dangers from police. She didn't claim her experience was equivalent, which is important. The main issue is whether her call was justified. Since she was in her home, felt threatened, and acted accordingly, she might not be in the wrong. However, the context of race and the potential for reinforcing negative stereotypes adds complexity. \n\nIn conclusion, while her actions might be legally justified, the social implications are tricky. But considering her intent was fear-based and not malicious, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a clear legal or moral wrongdoing here. Since calling 911 in a perceived threat is acceptable, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
