I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a Black man is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman saw a man at her window at 2 AM, got scared, called the police, and now is facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone, in a scary situation, and felt threatened. Her actions were driven by fear and a desire to protect herself. She didn't know who he was, couldn't see him well, and was panicking. She screamed, locked herself in, and called 911, which is generally a standard reaction to a perceived threat. She also texted her roommate, so she was trying to ensure their safety. The police found the man, and it turned out he was supposed to be there but confused. \n\nNow, looking at the backlash. People are accusing her of racism, suggesting she should have approached the situation differently. The key issue here is the racial aspect. Even though she claims she would have called regardless of his race, others are interpreting her actions as biased because of the person's skin color. This is a common concern in cases where white individuals call police on Black individuals for benign reasons, which can lead to dangerous outcomes, especially given the history of racial profiling and police violence against Black people.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's fear is valid. She was in a vulnerable situation at night, and her perception of danger led her to act quickly. She didn't know if he was there to harm her or if there were others. The problem arises when her fear intersects with racial bias, even if she didn't intend it. The fact that others are accusing her of racism suggests that her actions are seen as contributing to systemic issues, even if her intent wasn't malicious.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to weigh both sides. Legally, she might not be at fault since she perceived a threat. Ethically, the question is about the racial implications. Even if she didn't mean to be racist, her actions can be seen as part of a larger pattern of racial profiling. However, she also didn't have malicious intent and was in a state of panic. \n\nIn similar past cases, people have been criticized for similar actions, especially when they result in harm to the other person. The backlash she's facing is part of a societal critique of how Black individuals are treated in such situations. So, while her fear is understandable, the act of calling the police based on race can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. \n\nBut I also need to consider the balance between personal safety and societal issues. She was trying to protect herself, which is a natural instinct. However, the way her actions are perceived is crucial. If the police had acted differently because of his race, that's a separate issue, but her calling the police could still be seen as problematic if it's based on racial bias. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent (she was scared and trying to stay safe), but her actions could be seen as contributing to a system that disproportionately affects Black people. However, without explicit intent to discriminate, it's challenging to say she's definitively in the wrong. The answer might be a nuanced \"B\" (not in the wrong) because her actions were based on fear, but there's a valid societal critique of how such situations play out.\n"
