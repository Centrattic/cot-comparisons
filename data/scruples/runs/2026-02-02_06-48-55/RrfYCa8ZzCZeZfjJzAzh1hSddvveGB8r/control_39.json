I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a college student who wakes up, goes to the kitchen, and sees a man pressed against the window. They make eye contact, and he says \"Let me in.\" The author gets scared, screams, locks herself in, and calls 911. The police later find out the man had a friend expecting him and got confused. The backlash from classmates is making her question if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the circumstances. The key points here are her safety. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw someone at her window, and felt threatened. Her reaction was fear-based, leading to calling the police. The man wasn't inside, didn't have a weapon, but the situation could escalate. \n\nNow, considering societal context. There's a tension here between self-defense and racial profiling. The author claims she would have called regardless of the man's race. However, the backlash is about potential racial bias, given that the person was black. The question is whether her reaction was reasonable.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone perceives an immediate threat, calling 911 is a standard response. The police were called, and it turned out it was a misunderstanding. But the issue is whether her fear was justified. She couldn't see him well, but the man was at her window saying \"Let me in,\" which is a classic sign of attempted intrusion. \n\nHowever, the backlash is valid because of the real issues of racial profiling and police violence against black people. The author didn't have evidence he was dangerous, but her fear was based on the situation. The problem is that in similar situations, people of color might be unfairly targeted, and calling the police can have serious consequences.\n\nThe author also acknowledges that people of color face more danger with police interactions. She didn't compare her experience to theirs, but the fact remains that her action could contribute to systemic issues. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced case. On one hand, she acted out of fear for her safety, which is understandable. On the other hand, in hindsight, the situation was a misunderstanding. However, the intent wasn't to harm, just to ensure safety. The backlash is harsh, but the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nIn such cases, self-defense and fear are often considered justifiable reasons for calling police, even if it turns out to be a mistake. The key is whether her actions were based on a reasonable fear. Since she couldn't see him well and he was at her window, it's reasonable to feel threatened. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
