I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a female college student who called 911 after seeing a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was alone with one roommate asleep and another away. She saw him, couldn't see him clearly, made eye contact, he said \"Let me in,\" she panicked, screamed, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out he was supposed to be at a similar-looking apartment nearby and got confused. Now she's getting backlash for calling the police because he's Black, with people accusing her of racism and overreacting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she was wrong to call 911. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, her actions: She was in a situation where she felt threatened. She was alone, and someone was at her window at a late hour. She didn't know if the window was locked, if there were others, and she was scared. Her instinct was to protect herself and her roommate. She didn't have any details to give the police because it was dark and she couldn't see him. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, when someone feels their home is being invaded, especially at night, calling 911 is a common response. People are supposed to report anything that makes them feel unsafe. The police did respond, and it turned out the man had a legitimate reason but got confused. However, the key here is that she had a reasonable fear. She couldn't be sure, and in such scenarios, it's often advised to err on the side of caution.\n\nNow, looking at the backlash. People are accusing her of racism because the man was Black. They're saying she should have talked to him, asked what he wanted, or waited. But she couldn't see him clearly and was in a state of panic. The police found out he didn't have a weapon, but she didn't know that at the time. \n\nThe author also acknowledges that she didn't compare her experience to the dangers Black people face with police. She's aware of the racial disparities. However, others are interpreting her actions as racist regardless. \n\nThe challenge here is balancing personal safety with societal concerns about racial profiling. The article isn't about the man being harmed, just that he was confused. The author's fear was based on the situation, not the man's race. The police didn't mention that she called because of his race, and she didn't describe him, which might suggest it was the situation, not his race, that prompted the call.\n\nIn some cases, calling the police out of fear, even if mistaken, is seen as a responsible action. However, in the context of racial tensions and the history of mistrust between Black communities and police, her call might be viewed differently. But the author didn't have prior information to know he was Black before calling. The backlash seems to be more about the race, which she didn't mention, and people are assuming intent based on that.\n\nSo, the key points: Was her fear justified? Yes, in her mind, and she had a right to feel threatened. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but in the heat of the moment, calling 911 is a standard response. The backlash for her fear being racial is misplaced if her actions weren't based on race. She didn't describe him by race to the police, which might indicate it wasn't a factor. However, the fact that he was Black is leading others to accuse her of racism, but she didn't know his race at the time.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on self-defense and safety. She's not in the wrong for calling 911 when she felt threatened. The backlash might be more about societal issues than her specific actions. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
