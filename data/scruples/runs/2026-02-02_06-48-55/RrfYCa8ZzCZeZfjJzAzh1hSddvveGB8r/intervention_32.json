I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a female college student, called 911 after seeing a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, locked herself in the closet, and called the police. The man was actually supposed to be at a nearby unit but got confused. Now, people are accusing her of racism, and she's feeling hurt by the backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she was alone (except for one roommate who was asleep), in the middle of the night, and saw someone at her window. Her immediate reaction was fear and self-preservation. She didn't have time to assess the situation fully. It's natural to call the police when you feel threatened, especially if you're scared. She even mentions she didn't get a good look at him and couldn't describe him. Her actions were based on fear, not malice.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is about the racial aspect. The man is black, and some people are suggesting that she might have acted differently if he were white. There's also the point that he didn't have a weapon or threaten her directly. The question is whether her reaction was an overreaction due to racial bias. The police found out he was just in the wrong place, which adds to the criticism that she might have been racist.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't know the person was black when she called 911. Her reaction was based on the immediate danger she perceived, not on his race. However, after the fact, people are interpreting her actions through a racial lens, which complicates things. She acknowledges that she could have overreacted and that people of color face dangers with police that whites don't. She's also upset about the name-calling and the social fallout.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, in terms of legality, calling 911 when you feel threatened is generally acceptable. You don't have to be certain of a threat to call for help. The problem arises if there's a pattern of calling police on people of color without cause, but this seems like an isolated incident. However, the backlash is pointing out that her fear might be rooted in racial stereotypes. Even if her actions were legal, the context of systemic racism means that her decision can't be viewed in isolation. \n\nThe author argues she called because she was scared, not because of his race. But the fact remains that her action led to a black man being involved with the police, which can be dangerous. Even if the man was in the wrong place, the act of calling 911 could be seen as contributing to a harmful dynamic. The question is whether her fear was justified enough to excuse the call, or if she should have tried to verify the situation first.\n\nIt's tricky because self-preservation is a natural instinct. But the author's situation also highlights the tension between personal safety and the broader societal issues of racial profiling. The answer isn't black and white. If the author had more reason to believe it was a threat (like a weapon, breaking in, etc.), then her call is understandable. But since the man was just at the wrong window and not threatening, maybe she overreacted. But she couldn't know that at the time.\n\nConsidering all that, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong because her actions were based on fear and not malice. However, she should take responsibility for how her actions impacted someone else. But given the context, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong (B), but she should reflect on her actions and the potential for bias in the future.\n"
