I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The man turned out to be someone who was supposed to meet a friend but got the wrong door. People are criticizing her for calling 911 and accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was alone in her house at night, saw someone at her window, and felt threatened. Her reaction is understandable from a safety perspective. She wasn't certain about the man's intentions, and in such situations, people tend to act on fear. The police later confirmed that the man was in the wrong place, but her initial action was based on her perception of danger.\n\nNow, the backlash she's facing includes people accusing her of racism. However, the key point here is that the color of the man's skin shouldn't have influenced her actions. The question is whether her call to 911 was based on racial bias or genuine fear. The user mentions that she would have called regardless of his race, which suggests she didn't act out of racial prejudice. The police response also showed that the situation was resolved without harm to anyone involved.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are right to point out that calling police on a person of color can have serious consequences, especially given the systemic issues with policing. However, in this case, the woman didn't know his race at the time; she only mentioned his race in the context of the backlash. Her primary concern was her safety, which is valid. \n\nThe user is also upset about the backlash. While it's important to acknowledge the concerns about racial profiling, her fear of a potential break-in at 2 AM is a legitimate reason to call the police. The fact that the police found the man and clarified the misunderstanding suggests that her action, while perhaps a false alarm, was not malicious. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The woman acted out of fear for her safety in a potentially dangerous situation. She didn't harm anyone, and the police were able to handle the situation. The backlash seems to be misdirected, as her actions were based on perceived threat rather than race. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911, though she might have overreacted out of fear. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since her primary action was a response to a perceived threat, and there's no evidence of intent to discriminate, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
