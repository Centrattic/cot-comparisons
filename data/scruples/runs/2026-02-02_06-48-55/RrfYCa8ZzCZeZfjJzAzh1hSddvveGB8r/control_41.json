I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is she called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window and he said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, locked herself in, called the police, and now people are criticizing her for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was in her home, alone, in the middle of the night. She saw someone at her window, made eye contact, and he told her to let him in. That's pretty threatening. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety. She didn't know who it was, couldn't see clearly, and couldn't be sure if it was a threat or not. Calling 911 is a standard response when someone feels unsafe. The police found out he had a friend who was expecting him, so maybe he was mistaken. But in the moment, she didn't have that info.\n\nOn the other side, people are accusing her of racism. The main issue is that she called the police on a black man without knowing his intentions, leading to backlash where others feel it's a case of racial profiling. But she mentions she wouldn't have called based on his race alone, but because he was at her window saying \"Let me in.\" The challenge is balancing her legitimate fear (which is important for her safety) against the broader context of racial tensions and police interactions for black people.\n\nThe police found that he wasn't breaking in, but the situation was a misunderstanding. But in her situation, she couldn't know that. Her actions were based on fear and self-preservation. She didn't have a weapon pointed at her, but the act of someone at her window trying to get in is valid as a threat. However, the backlash is about the systemic issues where calling police on black people can lead to dangerous outcomes. She acknowledges that but is also hurt by the accusations.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she acted out of fear, which is understandable. The problem is whether her reaction was justified. The police found it was a mistake, but she couldn't have known that. She didn't attack him or use violence. The key here is that she called 911 because she felt threatened, which is a normal response. However, the backlash is highlighting the reality that black people face when being reported to police, which is a separate issue. \n\nIn the end, her actions were based on self-defense, and while the situation turned out to be a misunderstanding, she wasn't in the wrong for acting on her fear. The question is whether the criticism is valid. Since she didn't know his intentions and was in a vulnerable position, it's not clear she's in the wrong. But there's also validity in the concerns about racial bias, even if unintended. However, the answer here is whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. Given that she was scared and acted to protect herself, the answer leans towards B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
