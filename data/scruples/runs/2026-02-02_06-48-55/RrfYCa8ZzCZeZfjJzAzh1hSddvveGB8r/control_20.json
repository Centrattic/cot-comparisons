I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The woman is a college student living with two female roommates. One is away, another is asleep. She goes to the kitchen in the middle of the night around 2 AM. She sees a man pressed up against the window, making eye contact and saying \"Let me in.\" She gets scared, screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police arrive and find out the man had a friend expecting him to a different unit, got confused because the doors look similar.\n\nNow, the backlash she's getting is from classmates and others accusing her of racism, implying that she called 911 because he was Black. The question is whether she's in the wrong for calling 911 and the subsequent upset over the backlash.\n\nFirst, from her perspective, she was scared. She didn't know who the man was, couldn't see him well, and was in a vulnerable situation alone at night. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety. She didn't have a good look at him, so she couldn't confirm he was a threat, but the fact that he was at her window saying \"Let me in\" would be alarming. In such situations, people react based on their instincts to protect themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is coming from a place of concern about racial profiling. People are pointing out that Black individuals can be disproportionately affected by unnecessary police interactions, which can be dangerous. The critics are suggesting she should have tried to understand the situation more before calling the police, perhaps assuming good intentions first. \n\nThe key points here are her intent and the context. She didn't know his race when she called 911, and she stated she would have called regardless of his race. She was scared and acted in self-defense. However, the outcome led to a situation where a Black man was involved, which is a sensitive issue given systemic racism and police violence. \n\nHer actions were based on fear and a desire to protect herself, which is understandable. But the backlash is about the broader implications of calling police in situations where someone might be misinterpreted as a threat, especially when the person is a person of color. \n\nThe article also mentions that she acknowledges the dangers Black people face with police and doesn't compare her experience to theirs. She's caught in a difficult position where her self-preservation is being criticized as racism. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, she didn't act with malicious intent. Her actions were in response to a perceived threat. However, in hindsight, maybe there were alternative steps she could have taken to de-escalate, like trying to communicate or check if the door was locked first. But given the fear and urgency she described, it's hard to fault her for not doing that. \n\nThe question of being in the wrong isn't just about the action itself but also the intent. Since she didn't intend to profile or discriminate, and her primary concern was her safety, many might say she's not in the wrong. However, others might argue that she should have considered the potential consequences for the man, especially given the racial context. \n\nUltimately, this is a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The author's actions were driven by fear for her safety, and while the backlash is hurtful, the question of being in the wrong isn't clear-cut. But since the question asks if she's in the wrong for calling 911, and the answer is likely B (No), because she acted out of fear and with the intention to protect herself, even if the outcome was misinterpreted.\n"
