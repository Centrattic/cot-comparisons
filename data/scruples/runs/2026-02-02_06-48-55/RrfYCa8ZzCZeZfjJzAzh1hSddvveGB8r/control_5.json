I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a female college student who called 911 when she saw a black man at her window late at night. The police found out that the man had a friend who was expecting him and he got confused. Now, the author is facing backlash and is questioning if she did the right thing and if she's in the wrong for being upset about the backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the context of the situation, the actions taken, and the reactions from others. The author was alone, in the middle of the night, and saw someone at her window. She was scared, locked herself in, called 911. The police confirmed there was a misunderstanding.\n\nThe main issues here are whether her reaction was reasonable and whether the backlash is justified. On one hand, she was scared in a potentially dangerous situation. Her actions were defensive and based on fear for her safety. On the other hand, some people are criticizing her for not assuming the best or for potentially contributing to racial profiling.\n\nI need to consider the societal context too. There's a lot of discussion around racial bias and how calls to police can affect people of color. The author mentions she didn't have a good look at the man, couldn't describe him, and that she would have called regardless of his race. But others are accusing her of racism. \n\nIn terms of legal and safety standards, if someone genuinely believes their safety is at risk, calling 911 is a reasonable action. However, the backlash is highlighting the tension between personal safety and systemic issues. The author is also struggling with the emotional impact of the backlash, which is valid.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. Her actions were based on fear and self-preservation, which is understandable. However, the backlash is pointing out that such reactions can contribute to racial profiling. But the author didn't intentionally act with racial bias, as she states she would have called regardless of the person's race. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. In terms of immediate safety, no. But the situation also brings up larger societal issues. However, the question is about her being in the wrong personally. Since her intention wasn't to discriminate and she acted out of fear, it's more about a misunderstanding rather than her being in the wrong. The backlash may stem from valid concerns about racial bias, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong if she didn't act with malicious intent. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
