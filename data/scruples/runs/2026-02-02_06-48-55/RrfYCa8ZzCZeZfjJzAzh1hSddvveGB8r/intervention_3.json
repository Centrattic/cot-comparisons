I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation involves the author seeing a man pressing against the window at 2 AM, making eye contact, and the man saying \"Let me in.\" The author screams, locks herself in, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police later find the man, who had a friend expecting him and got confused about the door.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author was scared, in a vulnerable situation alone at night. She didn't have a good view, couldn't see if the window was locked, and was uncertain about potential accomplices. Her reaction was fear-based. However, the man was black, and she's facing accusations of racism. The question is whether her actions were justified or if she's at fault.\n\nOn one hand, people argue that calling 911 was a reasonable response to a potential break-in, especially in a panic. On the other hand, critics point out that she didn't engage with the situation, didn't try to communicate, and that her actions could be seen as racially motivated. The backlash she's facing is about the racial implications of her actions, even if her intent wasn't to be racist.\n\nThe author acknowledges that people of color face dangers when dealing with police, and she didn't compare her experience to theirs. But the issue is whether her action was an overreaction based on race. The police found the man was harmless, but she had no way of knowing that at the time. \n\nIn terms of legal right, calling 911 is a citizen's duty if they feel threatened. However, the racial aspect complicates it. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for reacting that way given the man's race. The user initially thinks she's at fault, but others might argue she acted out of fear.\n\nI need to decide between A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). Considering the situation, her fear was real, and the police resolved it without harm. However, the racial context and the fact that she didn't attempt to communicate before calling might support the view that she is in the wrong. But others might see her as acting in self-defense. It's a tough balance between fear and racial bias. The article ends with her questioning if she's in the wrong for both actions and the backlash. I think it's a nuanced case where the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she acted out of fear, but there's room to say she could have handled it differently. However, the answer hinges on whether her actions were unjustified based on race. Since she didn't know his race at the time and was in a panic, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the backlash is about the perception of racism. Hmm.\n"
