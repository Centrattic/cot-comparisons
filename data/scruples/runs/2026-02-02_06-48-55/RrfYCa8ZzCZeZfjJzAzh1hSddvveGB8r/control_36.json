I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM, and he said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, didn't know if he was a threat, and called the police. The police later said he was supposed to go to a different apartment and got confused. Now, she's getting criticized for calling the police and being accused of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From her perspective, she was in a vulnerable situation. It's late at night, she's alone with one roommate asleep and another away. Seeing someone at the window, making eye contact, and being told \"Let me in\" would be terrifying. Her reaction\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911\u2014is a natural response to fear for her safety. She didn't have time to verify if he was a threat, and she didn't get a good look at him because it was dark.\n\nOn the other hand, people are criticizing her because the man was black, and they're suggesting that she overreacted. They're comparing it to situations where calling the police on a white person might be seen as less problematic. There's also the point about the police finding out he was supposed to go to another apartment, which might imply he wasn't a threat. But the key here is that at the time, she didn't know that. She had no way of knowing if he was a friend or a stranger. \n\nThe question is whether her reaction was reasonable. The article mentions that the police came and found the man, and he had a friend who was expecting him. So from an external view, maybe the situation wasn't as dangerous as she thought. However, in the moment, her fear was real, and she acted on that fear. \n\nThere's also the social context of racial profiling. The author is white, and the man was black, which adds a layer where calling the police on a black person can be seen as contributing to systemic issues, especially given the history of police interactions with black individuals. However, the author states she would have called 911 regardless of his race, which is something to consider. \n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism and hurtful comments. But she's also trying to acknowledge the other perspective, recognizing that black people face different dangers with police. So she's not dismissing their experiences. \n\nIn terms of legal and safety standards, calling 911 when you feel threatened is generally acceptable. The police are there to respond to emergencies, and if someone believes they're in danger, reporting it is a valid action. The fact that the police were able to resolve the situation without harm supports that calling was appropriate. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she didn't try to communicate or wait to see if he left, but given the time, fear for her safety, and the fact that he was at her window, those steps might not be feasible. In a panic state, people don't always follow a logical sequence. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were driven by fear and a desire to ensure her safety. While there's a valid critique about racial profiling and the potential for over-policing, the immediate threat she perceived justifies her response. She didn't act with malice or intent to harm, and she's reflecting on her actions to understand others' perspectives. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. The backlash is harsh because it doesn't consider the context of her fear and the real possibility of danger she faced at the time.\n"
