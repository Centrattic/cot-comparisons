I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation involves a female student who saw a man at her window, got scared, and called the police. The police later found out he had a friend in a similar unit and was confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was alone, scared, and in the middle of the night. She didn't know if the window was locked, and the man approached her window and said \"Let me in.\" That's a pretty scary scenario. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety. \n\nBut then there's the backlash where people are accusing her of racism. She's being called names and faced with the idea that she shouldn't have called 911 just because the man was black. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nLegally, if someone perceives a threat and calls the police, especially in a situation where their safety is at risk, that's generally acceptable. However, the social context here is complicated. The man was not in the house, didn't have a weapon, and turned out to be mistaken. So some might say she overreacted. But others might argue that fear and self-preservation justify her actions.\n\nThe author also acknowledges that people of color have different experiences with police. She didn't compare her situation to theirs, but the backlash is happening regardless. The question is if she's in the wrong for calling 911 or for being upset about the backlash.\n\nThere's a balance here between personal safety and societal concerns about racial profiling. The answer might depend on perspective. If the law is concerned, calling 911 in perceived danger isn't wrong. However, from a social justice angle, the situation might be seen as a case of implicit bias leading to unnecessary police involvement.\n\nBut the author's intent was fear-based, not malicious. She couldn't see him well, and the man did approach the window. So her reaction might be understandable. However, the fallout highlights the broader issue of how such actions affect communities of color. \n\nIn these AITA scenarios, the community often looks for nuances. The author didn't have malice, but her actions contributed to a problematic situation. The backlash is valid because of systemic issues, but her initial fear might also be justified. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the question is strictly about calling 911, maybe not. But the way people reacted to her actions is another layer. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong for her actions, not the backlash. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she acted out of fear for her safety. But there's a possibility of overreaction. \n\nAlternatively, if the man was just mistaken, maybe she could have approached it differently, but in the moment, panic can lead to instinctive actions. Given that, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because her primary concern was her safety, and there's no evidence of racism in her intent.\n"
