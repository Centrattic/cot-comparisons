I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 was in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The woman is alone at night in her house, sees a man pressed against her window, he says \"Let me in,\" she's scared, screams, locks herself in, calls 911. The police found out the man had a friend who was expecting him, but he got the wrong door.\n\nNow, the key points here. She was in a scary situation, acting out of fear. She didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. Her reaction was immediate fear, leading her to call emergency services. On the flip side, people are accusing her of racism because the man was Black. They're saying maybe she should have just talked to him instead of calling 911, which could be dangerous for him, especially considering police interactions.\n\nFrom her perspective, she was in a vulnerable situation. The man was at her window uninvited, which is alarming. Her instincts tell her to protect herself. She didn't have a good look at him, couldn't describe him, so she had no way to verify his intentions. She was justified in being scared. Also, she mentions she's not equating her experience with the systemic issues Black people face with police, which is important.\n\nBut then, the backlash. The name-calling and accusations are tough. The question is whether she's at fault. Legally, calling 911 when you believe there's a threat is acceptable. She didn't know the context of the man's presence. The police found out it was a misunderstanding, but that doesn't mean her initial reaction was wrong. People might criticize her, but fear can cloud judgment. \n\nHowever, the other angle is that calling police on a Black person without clear threat can be seen as contributing to racial profiling. But she didn't know his race when she called. The situation was immediate, and she was alone. The question is whether she overreacted based on fear rather than evidence. \n\nIn the end, I think she's not in the wrong. Her actions were based on self-preservation in a scary situation. While the outcome was a misunderstanding, her reaction was a natural response to perceived danger. The backlash is harsh, but she's not in the wrong for acting on instinct to ensure her safety.\n"
