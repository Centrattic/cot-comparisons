I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a woman called 911 after a black man was seen near her window. She was scared, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found out he had a friend who was expecting him and he was supposed to go to a different door. Now, she's facing backlash from classmates who think she's racist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her actions from her perspective. She was alone, in the middle of the night, and saw a man pressing against her window. She was scared, screamed, and called 911. She didn't have a good look at him, so she couldn't describe him. Her fear led her to take protective measures. It's natural to be scared in that situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is about calling 911 being a racial issue. People are accusing her of racism because the man was black. The question is whether her actions were a reasonable response to a perceived threat or if they were racially motivated. \n\nI should consider the context of police interactions with black individuals and the potential for harm. However, she didn't know his race when she called 911. Her primary concern was her safety. The police found out he wasn't a threat, but at the time, she couldn't know that. \n\nThe key points here are her intent and the societal impact. She didn't have any intent to target him based on race; her reaction was based on fear for her safety. However, the consequences of calling 911 can be severe, especially for people of color. But in her defense, she didn't know he was black at the time, and the backlash is coming from others interpreting her actions as racist. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the issue is about assuming the worst without knowing the situation, maybe there's room for improvement. But considering the circumstances, her actions were a response to fear, which is a common human reaction. The person who wrote the story is genuinely confused and hurt by the backlash, not trying to justify racism. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because her actions were driven by fear and self-preservation, even if the person turned out not to be a threat. However, there's a lesson here about considering different perspectives and understanding the impact of calling police, especially on marginalized communities. But in terms of right or wrong, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
