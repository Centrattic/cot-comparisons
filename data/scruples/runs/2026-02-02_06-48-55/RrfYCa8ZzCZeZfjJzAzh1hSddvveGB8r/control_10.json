I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man who was outside their window. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a female college student who saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. The police found out the man was supposed to be let in by a friend but got confused. Now she's facing backlash from classmates and others, accusing her of racism.\n\nSo, the key points here are: her actions were based on fear for her safety, she didn't know his intentions, and she didn't have a good look at him. The man wasn't inside her home, but he was at her window, which can be a scary situation. The backlash is making her feel called out for being racist.\n\nOn one side, she had a legitimate fear for her safety. At night, a stranger at the window could be threatening. Her instinct to call for help is natural. She didn't know if he was a threat or not. Also, she didn't make assumptions beyond the situation\u2014she just reacted out of fear.\n\nOn the other side, some might argue that she should have approached the situation differently. Like, maybe trying to communicate first before calling 911. But in her defense, she was in a vulnerable situation, alone, and scared. She didn't want to wake her roommate, so she didn't turn on the light. The fact that she was able to describe him as a black man later might be relevant, but in the moment, her priority was to protect herself.\n\nAlso, considering the context of racial tensions and police interactions, people might be more sensitive to 911 calls involving black individuals. The backlash she's facing is part of a larger societal issue where such actions can be seen as contributing to profiling. But she didn't know the man, so it's not clear if race was a factor in her decision. She even mentions that she wouldn't call 911 based on race.\n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. From a self-defense perspective, she acted out of fear for her safety. However, the backlash is about potential racial bias. But she didn't act out of malice or prejudice; she just wanted to ensure her safety. The people criticizing her are making assumptions about her motives, which might not be fair.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). Her actions were driven by fear in a dangerous situation, and she didn't have the information to know it was a mistake. The backlash is harsh, but she acted in what she believed was necessary to protect herself. However, it's also important to acknowledge the concerns about racial bias in policing, but in this case, she didn't have that intent.\n"
