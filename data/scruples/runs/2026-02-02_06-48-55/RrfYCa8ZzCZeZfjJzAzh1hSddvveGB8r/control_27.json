I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a Black man is in the wrong. The situation is described where the woman sees a man at her window late at night, feels scared, and calls the police. The police later say the man had a friend who was supposed to let him in and he got confused. Now, she's facing backlash for calling 911 because he's Black.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone in her house, saw someone at the window, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" That's a scary situation. She didn't turn on the light to avoid waking her roommate, so she couldn't see him clearly. Her reaction\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911\u2014seems like a natural response to fear for her safety. She didn't know if he was a threat, and given that he was at her window, it's understandable she'd assume the worst. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is significant. People are accusing her of racism, implying she's profiling based on race. The man wasn't a threat, didn't have a weapon, and wasn't in her house. But she had no way of knowing that at the time. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThere's a tension between personal safety and the potential for over-policing of Black individuals. The user acknowledges that she's not comparing her experience to the systemic issues Black people face with police, but others are making that connection. The question is whether her actions, while driven by fear, were unjustified because of the man's race. \n\nThe police found the man, and he wasn't a threat. So maybe in hindsight, she could have done something else, like trying to communicate. But in the moment, when scared, calling 911 is a standard reaction. Also, the fact that others are attacking her for being racist adds another layer. It's possible that the situation highlights the challenges of balancing safety concerns with racial bias. \n\nI think there's nuance here. She's not wrong for prioritizing her safety, but the backlash is also pointing out that similar incidents can lead to real harm for Black individuals. So, the answer might depend on whether her actions were the fault of racial bias or a genuine fear of intrusion. Since she didn't act on race (she mentions she would have called regardless of his color), her intent was based on the situation. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
