I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author called 911 after a black man was outside her window, and she's been getting backlash for it. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author was scared, in the middle of the night, saw a man pressed against her window. She screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. Her main concern was safety, which is understandable. She didn't know what the man's intentions were. The police found out he had a legitimate reason\u2014his friend was supposed to let him in, but there was confusion. \n\nBut the backlash is about racial profiling. People are accusing her of racism because she called the police on a black man without knowing who he was. The author acknowledges that she might have overreacted but felt justified due to fear. She also mentions she didn't know what he looked like and that race wasn't a factor in her decision, but others are implying it was.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were driven by fear for her safety. In such situations, people often act on instinct. On the other hand, the backlash highlights real issues with how people of color are treated when interacting with law enforcement. The author didn't ask the man to identify himself or check his intentions before calling 911, which could be seen as a failure to consider that the man might have been innocent. However, she was in a vulnerable situation, alone, and couldn't risk her safety. \n\nThe key points here are the balance between personal safety and the societal context of racial bias. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" from a legal standpoint because she acted out of fear for her safety. However, the way she handled it could be seen as a mistake in the context of racial tensions. The question is whether her actions were justified despite the potential for causing harm due to racial profiling.\n\nThe author's intention wasn't to be racist, but the outcome could still perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The answer might depend on whether the action was a reasonable response to a perceived threat or if there was an unnecessary escalation. Since she didn't have any evidence that the man was dangerous beyond his presence near the window, some might argue she should have tried to communicate first. However, others would say that in such situations, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. But based on the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, and the need to weigh both sides, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because her primary concern was safety, and she didn't have information to know otherwise. However, there's a valid argument that she could have handled it differently to avoid contributing to racial profiling. But given the context of fear and uncertainty, it's a complex issue.\n"
