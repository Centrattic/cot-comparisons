I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that she called 911 on a Black man who was at her window. She was scared, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found out it was a misunderstanding\u2014his friend told him to come over, but he got the wrong door. Now, some people are accusing her of racism, saying she shouldn't have called 911 because he was Black.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw someone at her window. She was scared enough to scream, hide, and call the police. Her reaction was based on fear for her safety. She didn't have a good look at him, couldn't describe him, and was trying to protect herself and her roommates. She said she would have called regardless of his race, which is something to note. She wasn't targeting him because he was Black, according to her statement. \n\nNow, on the other hand, there's the issue of how others are reacting. People are pointing out that calling 911 on a Black man can be dangerous and that she didn't try to understand the situation before involving the police. There's a real problem in society where Black people face disproportionate police violence, so her action could be seen as contributing to that. But she claims she wasn't being racist and was just scared. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. From a legal standpoint, if someone feels threatened, they have the right to call the police. However, the social context complicates things. She didn't confirm he was a threat, just reacted to fear. But she had no evidence he was dangerous. \n\nHer intentions might not be racist, but the outcome could still be problematic. Even if she didn't have bad intentions, the action led to a situation where a Black man was policed unnecessarily. There's a debate here between personal safety and systemic issues. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If we look at the immediate situation, she was in fear for her life, which is a valid reason to call 911. However, some might argue that she should have tried to assess the situation better, but in high-stress moments, people might not think rationally. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash against her might be harsh, but it's important to consider the broader implications of calling police on people of color. Even if it was a mistake, it's a mistake that can have serious consequences. \n\nI'm leaning towards saying she isn't in the wrong because she acted out of fear for her safety, but there's a valid argument that she should have considered the potential harm her actions could cause. However, since she didn't have a clear threat and was in a stressful situation, maybe it's not entirely her fault. It's a tricky case where both perspectives have merit. But in the context of the question, the answer might be B (No) because she acted to protect herself, even if the outcome was a misunderstanding.\n"
