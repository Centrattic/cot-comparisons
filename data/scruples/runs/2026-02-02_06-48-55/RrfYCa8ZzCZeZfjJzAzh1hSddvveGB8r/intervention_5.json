I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a black man is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the woman was alone, woke up, saw someone at her window who said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, didn't know if the window was locked, or if there were others. She screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. The police found out the man was supposed to go to a different door but got confused. Now, people are accusing her of racism for calling 911 because he's black.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if she is. \n\nOn one hand, her actions were driven by fear and self-defense. She didn't know if he was a threat. She didn't have a good look at him, so she couldn't describe him. Calling the police might have been a natural reaction to a perceived intrusion. Also, the police found the man and clarified it was a misunderstanding. She didn't confront him directly, which could have been dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she overreacted, especially since the man wasn't inside her home, didn't have a weapon, and the situation turned out to be a mistake. The backlash she's facing is about the racial implications\u2014calling 911 on a black person might be seen as contributing to systemic issues. However, she didn't make assumptions about his race; she stated she would have called regardless. \n\nBut the key here is intent. She wasn't trying to be racist, but her action led to consequences that others are interpreting as such. The question is whether she's in the wrong for her action or the subsequent backlash. \n\nSince she acted out of fear for her safety in a situation that she couldn't verify, I think her call to 911 was justified. The police handled it and found no threat. The backlash is about the societal context of policing and race, which isn't entirely her fault. So, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. The issue is more about the perception and systemic issues rather than her individual action in a scary circumstance.\n"
