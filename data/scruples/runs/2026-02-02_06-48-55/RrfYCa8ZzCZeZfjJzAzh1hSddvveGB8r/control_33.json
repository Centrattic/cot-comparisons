I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man in this situation. Let's start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author is a female college student who wakes up at 2 AM, goes to the kitchen, and sees a man pressed against the window. She's in a house with two other female roommates, one away and one asleep. She's scared, screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police arrive and find out the man had a friend in a similar unit expecting him, so he got confused. \n\nHer classmates are criticizing her for assuming the worst, using the nickname \"Break in Barbie,\" and accusing her of racism. People are saying she should have talked to him first, not called 911 because he's black, etc. The author is hurt by the backlash and is asking if she's the asshole for calling 911 and for being upset about the reactions.\n\nFirst, the main question: was calling 911 wrong? Well, she was in a vulnerable situation: alone at night, saw a man at the window, he said \"Let me in,\" which is alarming. She was scared, didn't know if the window was locked, or if others were with him. Her actions (screaming, locking herself in, calling 911) seem like a reasonable response to a potential threat. She couldn't see him well, so couldn't describe him, but the fear is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the man wasn't armed, didn't enter the house, and it was a misunderstanding. The backlash is about racial profiling\u2014assuming someone is dangerous because they're black. The author says she didn't consider his race, just acted out of fear. She acknowledges that people of color face police dangers, so maybe she sees her actions as overreacting, but in the moment, she felt threatened.\n\nIs her reaction justified? In terms of self-defense and safety, yes. But the criticism is about racial bias. The question is whether her fear was based on legitimate threat or implicit bias. Since the situation was ambiguous, and she couldn't verify his intentions, calling 911 is a common safety measure. However, the context of race adds complexity. Some might argue that her fear was influenced by stereotypes, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe police resolved it as a misunderstanding, so maybe she overreacted, but her safety is important. The backlash is harsh, pointing out the racial implications. The author didn't claim the man was threatening beyond his actions (knocking on the window, saying \"let me in\"), which could be misinterpreted. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. She acted on fear for her safety, which is understandable. However, the criticism highlights how such actions can contribute to racial profiling. The author might not be in the wrong for her immediate reaction, but the backlash is also valid because it touches on systemic issues. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. Since her actions were based on fear and a perceived threat, and she couldn't verify his intentions, it's reasonable. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because she acted to protect herself, even if it led to a misunderstanding.\n"
