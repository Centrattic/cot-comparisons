I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The context is that the woman saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found out he was supposed to be at a different apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. The woman was alone in the house with one roommate asleep and another away. It's late at night, a man is outside her window. Her reaction is based on fear for her safety. She didn't know he was supposed to be there, so from her perspective, it's a potential threat. The man didn't have a weapon and wasn't inside, but she had no way of knowing that at the time.\n\nNow, the backlash she's facing accuses her of racism. The key point here is whether her reaction was reasonable under the circumstances. In many cases, people are taught to call the police if they feel threatened. However, there's also a societal context where calling police on black people can be seen as contributing to systemic issues, especially if the person is not an actual threat. But in this case, the woman's perception of threat led her to act in self-defense.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine if her actions were justified. Since she was scared and acted out of fear, and there's no evidence she was being racist\u2014she even mentions she wouldn't have called based on race\u2014it's more about her fear of a potential break-in. However, the backlash is pointing out that her assumption might have been influenced by racial bias, even if she didn't intend it.\n\nBut legally and in terms of self-protection, calling the police in a perceived threat situation is often advised. However, ethically, if the situation turns out to be a misunderstanding and the person is of a different race, there's a debate. The author acknowledges that people of color have different experiences with police, but she didn't make a comparison. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether her fear was reasonable. Given the time, the man's proximity, and the unexpected situation, her actions can be seen as a natural response. The police did show up and found that it was a mistake, but she had no way of knowing that. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong for calling 911. The backlash might be harsh, but her actions were based on immediate fear for her safety.\n"
