I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is that she saw a man at her window at 2 AM, which scared her. She called the police, and later found out he was with a friend and had the wrong door. Now she's facing backlash from classmates accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her actions. She was alone, in the middle of the night, and saw someone at her window. She was scared, locked herself in, and called 911. Her safety is a primary concern here. When someone is in a vulnerable situation and perceives a threat, calling the police is a common reaction. However, the man turned out to be mistaken, not a threat. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether her reaction was justified. The problem is that she didn't approach the situation to verify if he was a threat. She didn't try to communicate, just called 911 immediately. This can be seen as an overreaction, especially since the man was not inside her home or threatening her. \n\nThen there's the racial angle. The backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism because he was a black man. The key point here is that her decision was based on fear of a potential break-in, not the man's race. She mentions she didn't get a good look at him and would have called regardless of his race. However, the fact that she didn't consider other possibilities before calling might feed into existing racial tensions, where people of color are disproportionately affected by unnecessary police involvement. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. In terms of legal action, calling 911 when someone feels threatened is generally acceptable. But in terms of social responsibility and the impact on others, especially the man who was wrongly suspected, it's more complex. She might not be intentionally racist, but her actions still contributed to a situation that could be perceived as discriminatory. \n\nThe author also acknowledges that she can see how her reaction might be seen as over-the-top in hindsight. She wasn't a direct threat, but her fear was genuine. However, the backlash she's experiencing is also a factor. The key here is whether her actions were a reasonable response to a perceived threat or if she could have handled it differently without involving the police immediately.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. She acted out of fear for her safety, which is understandable, but the way she handled it without trying to de-escalate first might be seen as wrong. However, it's not clear that she acted with racial intent. The answer might depend on balancing her safety concerns against the potential harm of calling the police unnecessarily.\n"
