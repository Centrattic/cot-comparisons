I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for calling 911 on a black man and for being upset about the backlash.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in her home, saw a man at the window, felt scared, and called the police. The man was later found to be part of a mistake with a friend. The key points here are safety, context, and perception.\n\nShe was alone at night, which is a legitimate time for heightened caution. She couldn't see clearly because she didn't turn on the light to avoid waking her roommate. The man made eye contact and said \"Let me in,\" which is alarming. Her reaction\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911\u2014is a natural fear response. \n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism. The question is whether her action was wrong. In many places, the law supports contacting authorities if you feel threatened, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. The color of the person isn't the issue here; the problem seems to be her fear-based reaction. However, she's being criticized for not verifying the situation more, like talking to him or waiting.\n\nBut from her perspective, she didn't know if the window was locked, if there were others, or if he was a threat. Her safety is paramount. The police arrived and clarified the situation was a mistake. So, her action was based on fear and a desire to protect herself, which is understandable. \n\nThe backlash she's getting is problematic because it's attacking her for a genuine fear response, which can be seen as invalidating her experience. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Considering she acted out of fear and not malice, and the police resolved it without harm, she's not necessarily at fault. The people criticizing her might not be in the same situation, so their judgment could be harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that calling 911 should be a last resort or that she could have tried to communicate first. However, in a high-stress situation, people don't always act rationally. Her actions don't show intent to harm or discriminate, just fear. Also, the article mentions she didn't describe the man because she didn't get a good look, and she didn't compare her experience to others' issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for calling 911 due to fear for her safety. The backlash is harsh but doesn't necessarily make her actions wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
