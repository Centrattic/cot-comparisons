I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a female college student who called 911 because she saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found out the man had a friend in a similar unit and got confused. Now, she's facing backlash from classmates and others accusing her of racism, implying she overreacted because the man was Black.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's actions in a moment of fear, the context of a potential break-in, and the subsequent backlash. The question is whether her actions were wrong. \n\nLegally, she had the right to call 911 if she felt threatened. The man was outside her window, said \"Let me in,\" and she couldn't see clearly. Her fear might be understandable given the situation. However, the backlash is about racial profiling. The author mentions she didn't get a good look at him and would have called regardless of his race, but others are accusing her of racism. \n\nOn one hand, her safety is a priority, and calling the police is a standard response to a potential intrusion. On the other hand, the man was not a threat and the situation was a misunderstanding. The community's reaction is about the racial implications of calling police on a Black man, which can be dangerous. \n\nThe author acknowledges that Black people face dangers with police interactions. She didn't compare her experience to theirs but is being accused of racism. The question is whether her action, while understandable in fear, was wrong due to contributing to racial issues. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she might not be in the wrong for acting on fear, but she's also not accounting for the broader societal context. However, the system encourages calling 911 in emergencies. The police did show up and resolved it. \n\nSo, in a legal and safety context, she's not in the wrong. But socially, some might see it as a mistake because of the racial aspect. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on her immediate safety or the racial implications. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nGiven that her actions were in self-defense and there was a valid reason to call 911, even if it turned out to be a misunderstanding, the answer might be B (not wrong). But if the question is about the backlash, maybe she's not in the wrong for being upset. However, the first part is about whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she acted on fear for her safety, and the law allows calling 911 in such situations. The backlash may be harsh, but her action itself isn't wrong.\n"
