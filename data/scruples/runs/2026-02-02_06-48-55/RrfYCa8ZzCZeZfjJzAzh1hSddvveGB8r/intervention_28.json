I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a Black man is in the wrong. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the woman wakes up in the middle of the night, goes to the kitchen, and sees a man pressed against her window. She's scared, screams, locks herself in, and calls 911. The police find out that the man had a friend expecting him and got confused by the similar doors. Now, her classmates are criticizing her, saying she's racist for calling the police because he's Black.\n\nThe key points here are her state of mind and the actual situation. She was alone, scared, couldn't see clearly because it was dark, and didn't know if the window was locked. Her immediate reaction was fear for her safety, which is understandable. She didn't approach him or confront him, just called for help. \n\nOn the flip side, there's the societal context. People of color, especially Black individuals, face disproportionate risks when interacting with police. The backlash against her is pointing out that her fear might be rooted in racial bias. She acknowledges that she might have overreacted in hindsight and isn't making comparisons to the struggles of Black people. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, when someone feels their safety is threatened, especially at night and alone, calling 911 is a standard response. Fear can lead to overreactions, and not everyone is in a position to assess situations rationally under stress. The fact that the man turned out to be a friend doesn't negate her right to seek help when she felt in danger. However, the backlash is also valid because of the systemic issues around racial profiling and police interactions. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: her actions were based on fear and a perceived threat, which is a natural response. The problem arises from the societal implications\u2014her decision might contribute to the systemic issues that people of color face. However, she didn't act with malice; she was scared. The question is whether her action was wrong. \n\nIn terms of personal responsibility, she might have overreacted, but the context of fear and lack of information complicates that. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but she should reflect on how her actions fit into a larger societal context. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with the understanding that there's room for learning and growth.\n"
