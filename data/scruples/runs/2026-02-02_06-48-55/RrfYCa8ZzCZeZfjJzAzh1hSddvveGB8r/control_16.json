I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a female college student who called 911 after seeing a man outside her window at 2 AM. She was scared, didn't know if the window was locked, and felt threatened. The man ended up being a friend who was supposed to meet someone else. She's facing backlash for calling the police, with people accusing her of racism because he's Black.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions were justified. She was in a vulnerable situation\u2014alone, in the middle of the night, with someone at her window. Her immediate reaction was fear for her safety, which is natural. She didn't engage with the man directly, which could have been dangerous. Her priority was to protect herself and her roommate, so calling 911 was a safety measure.\n\nHowever, there's also a societal context here. Calling the police on a Black person can have serious implications, especially given the history of racial profiling and police violence against Black individuals. The fact that people are accusing her of racism suggests that her actions might be seen as contributing to systemic issues. But she clarifies that she would have called regardless of the man's race, emphasizing her fear at the time.\n\nThe key points are intent and context. She didn't know the man, felt threatened, and acted out of fear. While her reaction might be seen as an overreaction by some, others would argue that self-defense is valid. The backlash she's facing is harsh, and the comparison to racial issues might be unfair since she didn't intend to discriminate. However, her action had real-life consequences for the man, even if unintended.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. She acted out of fear for her safety, which is understandable, but the aftermath involves racial tensions. The question is whether her action was justified. Since she couldn't have known his intentions, and her primary concern was safety, she's not in the wrong. But she might have overreacted based on assumptions. However, given the circumstances, her actions were a self-protective measure. The answer is B (No).\n"
