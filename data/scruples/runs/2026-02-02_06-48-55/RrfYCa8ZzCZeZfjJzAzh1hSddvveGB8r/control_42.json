I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a female college student who saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found the man; he was supposed to meet a friend but got confused because the doors looked similar. Now, classmates are mocking her and accusing her of racism.\n\nThe core issue here is whether her reaction was justified. She was in fear for her safety in the middle of the night when someone was at her window. She didn't know who it was, couldn't see clearly, and was in a vulnerable situation. Her actions were based on self-defense and protecting her home.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is pointing out that the man was Black and that she didn't approach the situation with caution, like talking to him first. There's a valid concern here about racial bias and the disproportionate impact of calling police on people of color. However, the author mentions that she would have called regardless of his race due to fear.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, calling police when you feel threatened is within your right. The man was outside, not inside, and didn't have a weapon. But the situation could be seen as a misunderstanding. The author's fear isn't unfounded, but the reaction might be considered overzealous in hindsight.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between personal safety and societal issues. The author didn't know the man's intentions, and in a high-stress situation, panic can lead to overreactions. However, the accusations of racism are serious. The author claims she didn't act based on race, but others are interpreting her actions as racially motivated.\n\nThe police found that it was a misunderstanding, which might support her fear as a reasonable response given the circumstances. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the law says that calling police in a perceived threat is acceptable, then she's not in the wrong. However, socially, there's a push to de-escalate and consider race, which complicates things.\n\nIn summary, she acted out of fear for her safety, which is a valid trigger for calling 911. The backlash is valid in pointing out potential racial issues, but the primary issue was her fear. Since the situation didn't involve actual harm and the police resolved it as a misunderstanding, it's a tricky call. But legally and in terms of self-defense, she might not be wrong. The answer might be B (no), but there's a nuance here. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. Since she felt threatened and acted to protect herself, the answer leans towards B.\n"
