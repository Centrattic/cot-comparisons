I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man pressing against her window at night. The police found that the man had a legitimate reason (his friend was expecting him to let himself in), but there was criticism towards her for being racist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. On one hand, the author was scared. She was alone, it was late at night, and she saw someone at her window. Her instinct was to call 911 as a precaution. She didn't have a clear view, couldn't describe the man, and her actions were driven by fear for her safety. That seems like a natural reaction in a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nOn the other hand, critics are pointing out that the man didn't threaten her, wasn't inside her home, and that there's a risk in calling the police on a black man, given systemic issues with police interactions. The backlash includes accusations of racism and questioning her motives. The author acknowledges that she didn't compare her experience to those of black people, but the perception is there.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if her actions were indeed wrong. Legally, if someone feels threatened and calls the police, that's generally acceptable. The police did respond and clarify the situation. However, ethically, there's a debate. Was the call necessary when the man wasn't threatening? The author admits it could be overreaction in hindsight.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014late night, alone, fear for safety\u2014it's hard to say she was wrong in acting out of fear. The backlash is more about the racial implications than the situation itself. The key point is that the author didn't act with malice or intent to discriminate, but her fear might have been influenced by societal factors. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe she could have handled it differently, like trying to communicate first, but in a panic situation, that's not always feasible. The fact that she didn't know the man, couldn't see him well, and was in a vulnerable state justifies her fear. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether intent matters. If she didn't intend to be racist but acted out of fear, then she's not in the wrong. The backlash might be valid in highlighting systemic issues, but her individual action wasn't malicious. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
