I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a female college student, saw a black man pressed up against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and then texted her roommate. The police found out it was a mistake; the man was supposed to meet a friend and got confused.\n\nNow, people are accusing her of racism because she called the police on a black man. She's feeling hurt and is asking if she's in the wrong for calling 911 or for being upset about the backlash.\n\nFirst, from her perspective, she was in fear for her safety. She couldn't see clearly, was in a vulnerable situation at night, and the man was at her window saying \"Let me in.\" Her actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911\u2014are instinctive reactions to a perceived threat. The police also didn't find any weapons or threats from him, so maybe she overreacted but out of fear, not malice.\n\nOn the flip side, the backlash from her classmates is pointing out the racial implications. Calling the police on a black person without clear evidence can lead to unnecessary police interactions, which are historically more dangerous for people of color. Even if she didn't have bad intentions, her action could be seen as contributing to systemic issues.\n\nBut the key here is intent vs. impact. She didn't call the police because he was black; she called because she thought he was a threat. However, the impact of her action could still be harmful. The question is whether she's in the wrong for acting on fear versus understanding the broader context of racial profiling.\n\nSome might say she's not in the wrong because she acted to protect herself, which is a basic human instinct. Others might argue that in a society where racial bias exists, her action could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes, even if unintentionally. \n\nShe also acknowledges the potential overreaction and the dangers people of color face with police, which shows some self-awareness. However, the backlash is about the societal implications, not just her personal fear. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, her actions were based on fear and self-defense. On the other, the action had a racial impact that she might not have considered at the moment but should reflect on afterward. The question is whether the intent (self-defense) absolves her, or if the impact also makes her responsible for contributing to a problematic system.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether society holds individuals accountable for unintentional contributions to systemic issues. If so, then maybe she shares some responsibility. But if personal fear in a dangerous situation is given more weight, then she's not in the wrong. However, the fact that the person was black and the backlash is focused on that aspect might mean that her action, regardless of intent, is problematic in the context of racial bias. So, maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
