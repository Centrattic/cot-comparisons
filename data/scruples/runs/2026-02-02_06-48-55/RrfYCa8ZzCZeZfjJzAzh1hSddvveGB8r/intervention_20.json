I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The writer is a female college student who saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She panicked, screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found the man who had a friend expecting him to unlock the door, but he got confused.\n\nThe backlash from classmates is heavy, with accusations of racism and being a \"Break in Barbie.\" The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her reaction was reasonable. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw a man at her window. Even if it turned out he was mistaken, her fear for her safety is understandable. Calling 911 is a standard response to potential threats. She didn't know the man, couldn't see him clearly, and was in a vulnerable situation. \n\nHowever, the accusations of racism are part of the backlash. The key point is that she didn't call because of his race but because of the situation. She mentions she would have called regardless of his race. The issue is that some people see her action as contributing to the problem of racial profiling. But in her case, there's no indication she acted based on race. The backlash might be conflating her fear with racial bias, which is a real societal issue.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that she should have tried to communicate first. But given the time, the situation, and her fear, that's a high-pressure scenario. It's also important to note that she didn't engage with him, which could have been dangerous.\n\nThe police found the man, and there was no actual threat. So, in hindsight, maybe her reaction was an overreaction. But in the moment, when someone is in fear for their safety, acting on that fear is a survival instinct. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she's not wrong because she called authorities due to a perceived threat. Ethically, it's more nuanced. She might have overreacted, but not out of malice or racism. The backlash is harsh, and the comparison to racial profiling is unfair if her intent wasn't racially motivated. However, the situation could have been handled differently, and the backlash, while hurtful, highlights valid concerns about how 911 is used in communities of color. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by fear for her safety, and there's no evidence of racial intent. However, she might need to reflect on whether there's room for better judgment in similar situations. The backlash is a separate issue about societal tensions, but she isn't in the wrong for her actions.\n"
