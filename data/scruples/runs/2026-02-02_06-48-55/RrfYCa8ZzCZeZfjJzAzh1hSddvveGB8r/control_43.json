I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman who called 911 on a Black man is in the wrong. The situation involves her seeing a man at her window late at night, which scared her, leading her to call the police. The police found out the man had a friend expecting him and he was just confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her actions. She was alone, scared, and didn't know if the man was a threat. Her instinct was to protect herself and her roommates. She didn't have a good look at him because it was dark. She called 911 because she was in fear for her safety. \n\nOn the other hand, some people are criticizing her for racial bias, suggesting that she might have acted differently if the man were white. There's a valid point about systemic racism and how Black people face disproportionate police encounters. However, her action was based on fear and uncertainty, not necessarily race. She mentions she would have called regardless of his race.\n\nThe key factors here are her state of mind and the immediate threat she perceived. In many legal systems, a person can call the police if they feel threatened, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. Her actions led to the police finding the man, who wasn't a criminal but just mistaken. \n\nThe backlash she's facing is harsh, and while she should be aware of racial implications, her primary responsibility was to ensure her safety. It's important to balance personal safety with societal issues. She didn't incite violence; she called for help. However, there's a lesson here about considering potential biases and alternative actions, like contacting a friend first or trying to verify the situation before involving police. \n\nBut in the moment, her reaction was a self-preservation instinct. The police response resolved the situation without harm. So, while there's a valid critique about implicit bias and systemic issues, she isn't in the wrong for acting in fear to protect herself. The answer is B.\n"
