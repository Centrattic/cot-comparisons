I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a female college student who saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The man later turned out to be someone who was supposed to meet a friend nearby but got confused. \n\nNow, people are criticizing her for assuming the worst and calling 911, especially since the man was Black. They're accusing her of racism, suggesting she didn't give him a chance to explain. The author acknowledges that people of color face dangers with police and that she might have overreacted, but she was in fear for her safety.\n\nSo, the key points here: she had reason to be scared at night, the man was at her window, and she acted out of fear. But there's also the racial element, as critics are pointing out potential bias. \n\nIn the U.S., there's a cultural context where calling the police on Black people can be seen as racially motivated, especially when there's no immediate threat. However, the author claims she would have called regardless of the person's race. The question is whether her actions were justified given the fear for her safety or if she was wrong for not giving the man a chance.\n\nLegally, if someone feels threatened and calls authorities, that's their right. But socially, the situation is more nuanced. The backlash she's facing is about the racial implications, which she acknowledges. The challenge is balancing individual safety with systemic issues around racial profiling.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on fear and the situation as she perceived it. However, she did cause harm to a person by calling the police unnecessarily. But since the man wasn't armed and the situation was a misunderstanding, maybe she's partially at fault. But considering the fear she experienced, it's a complex case. The main issue is whether her reaction was a reasonable response to a perceived threat. Given the time (2 AM) and the man's presence at her window, her fear is understandable. But the backlash is also valid because of the racial context. So, the answer might depend on which perspective you prioritize: her safety or the systemic issues. Since the question is about her being in the wrong, and she had a legitimate fear, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. But others might see it as a case of racial bias. Hmm.\n"
