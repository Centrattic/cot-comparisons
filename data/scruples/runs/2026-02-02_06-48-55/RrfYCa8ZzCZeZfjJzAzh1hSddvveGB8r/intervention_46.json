I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a female college student called 911 because she saw a black man pressing up against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, locked herself in, called the police, and then faced backlash from classmates for being racist. The question is whether she did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was alone, it was late at night, she couldn't see well because she didn't turn on the lights to avoid waking her roommate. The man was at the window, made eye contact, and said \"Let me in.\" That's pretty alarming. Her reaction was to scream, lock herself in, and call 911. The police found out he was there by accident because his friend had asked him to come over but the doors looked similar.\n\nNow, the backlash is that people are accusing her of racism because he was black. She says she didn't even get a good look at him and would have called regardless of his race. But others are suggesting that she overreacted because she didn't try to communicate first or wait, and that her fear was based on his race.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, when in danger, people react based on their instincts and the information they have. At 2 AM, a stranger at the window making threatening remarks, even if it was a misunderstanding, is a scary situation. The fact that the man was there due to a mix-up doesn't change the fact that she had a legitimate fear for her safety. The police confirmed it was a misunderstanding, but her reaction was based on the immediate threat she perceived.\n\nHowever, the criticism is about the racial aspect. If she had done the same thing with a white person, would the reaction be different? That's a valid point. But the key here is that she herself says she didn't get a good look at him and would have called regardless of race. So her action wasn't based on his race but on the situation. The backlash is about the overreaction, not necessarily the race, but people are conflating the two.\n\nAlso, the police were able to resolve the situation without harm to the man. He wasn't armed or threatening, as far as we know. She might have misjudged the situation, but it's not clear that she was being racist. Her friends and others are pointing out that calling the police on a person of color can be dangerous, which is true, but she didn't know he was there by accident. She was trying to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she was scared and took steps to ensure her safety, which is understandable. On the other hand, some might argue that she could have tried to communicate first. However, given the circumstances\u2014late night, being alone, the man's actions\u2014it's hard to say she was wrong. The backlash seems harsh, especially since the outcome was non-violent. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong, because her actions were based on fear of immediate danger, not racial bias.\n"
