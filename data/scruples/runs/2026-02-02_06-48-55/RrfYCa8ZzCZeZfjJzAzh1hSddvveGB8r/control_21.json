I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man under the given circumstances.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author is a female college student who sees a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She's scared, screams, locks herself in, calls 911. The police later explain the man was supposed to meet a friend in a similar unit and there was confusion. \n\nNow, the accusations against her are that she's being racist because she called the police without knowing the man's intentions and because he's black. But the author argues that her fear was based on the situation\u2014someone at her window in the middle of the night, saying \"Let me in.\" She didn't have time to assess if he needed help; her immediate reaction was to protect herself.\n\nConsidering self-defense and safety, when someone is in a potentially dangerous situation and contacts authorities out of fear for their safety, it's generally considered a reasonable action. The color of the person involved shouldn't be the main factor; the behavior and context are key. However, the backlash she's receiving is part of a larger societal conversation about racial bias and police interactions with black individuals. \n\nShe does acknowledge that the reaction might be seen as overcautious and that the accusations of racism are valid concerns from others' perspectives. But she didn't describe the man as a threat beyond his presence at her window. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the police did find the man and it was a misunderstanding. So, she acted out of fear for her safety, which is understandable. But the question is whether that makes her in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, she's protecting herself. On the other, the backlash highlights the tension in similar situations involving race. The key is that she didn't have malicious intent; she was scared. However, the issue is also how her actions impacted the man and the broader implications. But legally and in terms of self-preservation, her actions seem justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she acted out of fear for her safety in a stressful situation, and the color of the person shouldn't negate her right to feel safe. However, the article might argue that there's a balance between personal safety and systemic issues, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is B.\n"
