I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She couldn't see who he was, was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. The police found the man who had been let in by a friend, but it was a mistake. Then her classmates are accusing her of racism because the man was black.\n\nSo, the main points are her fear and the subsequent accusations. She didn't know him, it was late, and she felt threatened. She acted out of fear for her safety. But people are criticizing her for not trying to talk to him first and for overreacting based on his race.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for calling 911. In the US, calling 911 in a potential emergency is generally advised if you feel threatened. Safety is a priority. However, the backlash is about race and assumptions. She didn't know the man, so her fear might be justified. But the other side is that she didn't confirm if he was a threat and might have contributed to a harmful stereotype. \n\nBut in the context, she didn't know him, was in a vulnerable situation, and acted on instinct. The police found out it was a mistake, but that doesn't mean her initial reaction was wrong. People might have different thresholds for fear. However, the backlash is about the assumption that she profiled him because he was black. She claims she would have called regardless of his race. \n\nIn many legal and social contexts, self-preservation is a valid reason. But the issue is that her actions led to accusations of racism. It's a tricky balance. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering that she called 911 due to fear for her safety, even if it turned out to be a misunderstanding, it's a common reaction. So, she might not be in the wrong. However, she could have taken a different approach, like checking if the window was locked first before calling 911, but she was in panic mode. \n\nThe key is whether her actions were unreasonable. In emergencies, people act on fear, and calling 911 is a standard response. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
