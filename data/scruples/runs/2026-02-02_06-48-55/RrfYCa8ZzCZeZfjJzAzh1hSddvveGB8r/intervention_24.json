I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man, based on the given scenario. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a female college student who, in the middle of the night, sees a man pressed against her window. She's scared, screams, locks herself in, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police later find that the man was there by mistake, expecting a friend's door. The backlash she's facing is that people are accusing her of racism for calling the police on a Black man.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions and the context. She was in a situation where she felt threatened. The man was at her window, said \"Let me in,\" and she couldn't see him clearly. Her immediate reaction was fear, leading her to call 911. From her perspective, she didn't have time to assess the situation fully, especially in the dark, and she was in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe question of whether she's in the wrong likely hinges on two things: her intent and the reasonableness of her actions. She didn't know the man, couldn't confirm his intentions, and was in a state of panic. Legally, if someone feels their safety is in danger, calling the police is a reasonable action. However, there's also a societal context where calling 911 on Black individuals can lead to dangerous outcomes, which is why the backlash exists.\n\nThe author acknowledges that she didn't act out of racism but out of fear. The police response resolved the situation without harm. The people criticizing her are suggesting that she overreacted, possibly due to racial bias. However, she also points out that she didn't have any other way to verify the man's intentions and that her actions were based on fear, not malice.\n\nIn terms of moral rightness, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author's fear is legitimate in a situation where someone is at her window at 2 AM. On the other, the societal implications of calling police on Black people are significant. However, since the man was not a threat and was just mistaken, some might argue that she could have approached the situation differently, like trying to communicate first. But given the circumstances and her state of fear, that's debatable.\n\nThe author also faces backlash for her actions, which she didn't initiate but now has to deal with. The question of whether she's in the wrong for being upset about the backlash is another layer. The friends she's told this to suggest she's not considering the broader context of Black people's experiences with police. However, she doesn't compare her situation to theirs, which is a key point.\n\nIn many cases, people are advised to call 911 in situations they perceive as threats, even if it's a false alarm. The key is intent. If the author truly believed there was a threat, then it's not her fault. However, the criticism is that the man was Black, which might lead to over-policing. But in this case, the man wasn't armed or threatening, and the situation was resolved without harm. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for calling 911. She acted based on fear and a perceived threat. The backlash is unfortunate, but her actions were a response to a scary situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
