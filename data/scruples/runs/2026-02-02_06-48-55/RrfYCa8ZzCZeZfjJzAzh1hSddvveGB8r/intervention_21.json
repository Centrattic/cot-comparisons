I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called 911 on a black man is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman saw a man at her window, was scared, and called the police. The police found out he was just a friend who got confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the woman's perspective, she was alone, scared, and in a situation that felt threatening. Her natural reaction was to call 911, which is a common response to perceived danger. She didn't have a good view, couldn't confirm his intentions, and was in a state of panic.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash she received is pointing out that she called the police on a black man without knowing his intentions. There's a valid concern about racial profiling and the disproportionate impact on communities of color when 911 is called unnecessarily. Even though she didn't act with malice, her action contributed to a situation where someone of color was policed without cause.\n\nThe key points are: her intent was self-protection, she didn't know his intentions, and the outcome was that the man was just mistaken. However, the issue is how her action is perceived in a broader context of racial tensions and police interactions. The question is whether her action was wrong despite her intentions.\n\nConsidering the AITA framework, it's about whether she's at fault. If she acted out of fear without knowing more, it might not be her fault. But if her reaction was based on stereotypes or lack of communication, maybe she could have handled it differently. But in the moment, she was scared and did what she thought was necessary to stay safe.\n\nThe fact that the man wasn't a threat and the backlash she faced for it complicates things. However, the system is such that calling 911 in fear is a common response. But also, there's an awareness now that such actions can have negative consequences for others. She acknowledges this in her reflection.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She intended no harm, acted out of fear, and didn't know the man's intent. But the action led to a racialized response. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she acted to protect herself, but she's also not in the right because the societal context matters. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that she didn't have malicious intent and was in fear, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The AITA format often leans towards understanding the situation without condemning unless there's clear fault. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
