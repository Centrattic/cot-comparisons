I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man at her window. The police found out the man was supposed to go to a different apartment but got confused. Now, classmates and others are criticizing her for calling the police and accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was alone, in the middle of the night, scared, and in a situation where she couldn't see clearly. Her immediate reaction was to call 911 because she felt threatened. Fear for personal safety is a strong factor here. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash comes from people concerned about racial profiling and the potential dangers black individuals face with police. The author acknowledges this, stating she didn't describe the man and that she would have called regardless of his race. However, others argue that she should have tried to de-escalate or ask who he was first.\n\nLegally, someone has the right to call 911 if they feel threatened. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable given the circumstances. She couldn't see clearly, was in a vulnerable situation, and feared for her safety. The police didn't hold any charges against the man, indicating that he wasn't a threat. But the author's intent wasn't malicious; she acted out of fear.\n\nHowever, the social context is important too. The incident happened in a time and place where racial tensions are high, and calling police on a person of color can lead to serious consequences. The question is whether her action, while understandable in her perspective, contributed to a problematic pattern of behavior. \n\nThe author isn't justifying it by race; she says she would have called regardless. But others are interpreting it as racial profiling. The debate is between individual safety and systemic issues. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. Legally, she might not be, as she acted to protect herself. Socially, some might see her actions as perpetuating harmful practices. But she didn't maliciously target the man based on race. She was scared and acted on instinct. The backlash, while harsh, is also part of a larger conversation about race and policing. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), because she acted out of fear for her safety, and while the outcome was a misunderstanding, her intent wasn't racially motivated. The backlash, though hurtful, doesn't necessarily make her the wrongdoer in this case.\n"
