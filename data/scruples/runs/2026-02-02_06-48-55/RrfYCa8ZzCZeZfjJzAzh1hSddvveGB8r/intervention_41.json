I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context, so the user is seeking an opinion on whether the action was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a female college student who saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and later found out the man had a friend who was expecting him and there was a mix-up with the doors. Now, classmates are criticizing her for assuming he was a criminal, and some are accusing her of racism. The author is conflicted between her fear and the backlash she's receiving.\n\nThe key points here are: the time was late (2 AM), the man was at the window (which could be a security concern), the author's fear leading to a natural reaction of calling police, and the subsequent backlash. The question is whether her action was wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, individuals can contact law enforcement if they feel their safety is threatened, regardless of the person's race. The author's fear in the moment is understandable, especially if she couldn't see clearly and was alone. However, the backlash is also a valid point because calling 911 can have serious consequences for the person involved, especially if they are a person of color, given existing issues with racial profiling and police interactions.\n\nThe author acknowledges that she didn't know the man's intentions and that he didn't have a weapon or threaten her. She also didn't describe him, which suggests it was a quick, panic-driven decision. On the other hand, others are arguing that she could have approached the situation differently, like talking to him first or waiting. But in a high-stress, fear-inducing situation, someone might not think through all options.\n\nIt's a balance between personal safety and the potential impact on others. The author didn't explicitly mention race as a factor in her decision, but the backlash is pointing out that race might have influenced perceptions. However, the story says she would have called 911 regardless of the man's race, which is a key point. The main issue is whether her fear was justified and if the response was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of societal context, there's a legitimate concern about over-policing and racial bias. The author's actions, while stemming from fear, might contribute to these issues. However, she didn't have a weapon or any prior indication that the situation was non-threatening. The confusion with the doors and the man's presence at 2 AM could be legitimate reasons for alarm.\n\nThe author is also hurt by the backlash, which is understandable. People might judge her without considering her fear. But there's also a responsibility to consider alternative actions, especially if the situation didn't involve immediate danger.\n\nIn summary, the situation is complex. The author acted out of fear, which is a natural response, but the consequences for the man and the broader racial implications are significant. Whether she's in the wrong depends on balancing personal safety with the potential harm caused by the call. I think the answer here is that she's not in the wrong for calling 911, as her primary concern was her safety, and in such situations, people are often advised to err on the side of caution. However, the backlash is also a reflection of societal issues, and she might need to reflect on how to handle such situations differently in the future to minimize harm.\n"
