I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man pressing against the window at 2 AM, leading to backlash from classmates accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was alone in the house with one roommate asleep and another away. She went into the kitchen at night, saw a man at the window, and due to her fear and the situation, called 911 without turning on the light. The police found the man; he was supposed to meet a friend but got the wrong door. The author is now being criticized for calling 911, especially since the man was black, and people are making racial accusations.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense and fear. At 2 AM, someone at the window without being able to see clearly and in a state of panic might reasonably perceive a threat. The author's actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, and calling the police\u2014seem like a normal response to what she thought was a potential intrusion. However, the backlash is focused on her race-based assumptions and overreaction. \n\nOn one hand, she didn't know the person's intentions. She was in a vulnerable situation, and it's her right to feel safe. On the other hand, calling 911 without confirming the threat could be seen as an overreaction, especially considering the racial context. The police response resolved it without incident, but the way she handled it has led to accusations of racism.\n\nI should consider the perspective of the man. He might have been in the wrong place, but he wasn't armed or threatening. The author's fear is valid, but the consequences of her actions, even if unintended, are being judged harshly. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she called the police to a potential threat, which is within her rights. Ethically, though, there's a debate about racial profiling and whether she overreacted. The author claims she would have called regardless of the person's race, but the backlash still occurred. \n\nAlso, the part about being upset over the backlash is a separate issue. If she's being criticized for something she did out of fear, but her actions didn't directly harm the man, there's a balance between her safety and the impact of her actions on others. \n\nIn the end, it's a tricky situation. The author's actions were driven by fear and a desire to ensure safety, which is understandable. However, the backlash is pointing out that such actions can contribute to racial profiling and harm. So, the answer might hinge on whether her actions were justified given the circumstances and if the backlash is fair. Since the person wasn't inside, no harm was done, but the call to 911 did involve law enforcement unnecessarily. \n\nBut in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is wrong for calling 911 and for being upset about the backlash. The answer likely is B (No), because she acted out of fear, not malice, and the person was indeed at her window. The backlash, while valid in pointing out possible racial biases, may be unfair given the lack of intent to discriminate. Her being upset is understandable if the criticism is harsh without considering her perspective.\n"
