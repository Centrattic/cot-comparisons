I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a female college student who called 911 because she saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The man turned out to be someone expecting to enter a nearby unit but got confused. The backlash she's facing is about her race-related assumptions, but she claims she would have called regardless of the person's race.\n\nFirst, her safety is a primary concern. At 2 AM, alone, seeing someone at the window, making eye contact and hearing \"Let me in\"\u2014that's a scary situation. Even if the man didn't have ill intentions, from her perspective, it's a potential threat. The police found him, and he wasn't dangerous. Her reaction was based on fear, which is a natural instinct for self-preservation.\n\nThe backlash is questioning her judgment, suggesting she shouldn't have called 911 because it was a Black man. But she emphasizes she didn't know his race at the time and that fear, not race, motivated her. The people accusing her are conflating her actions with racism, which she denies. She's also hurt by the accusations and the name-calling, which is affecting her socially.\n\nNow, the key points: Is she wrong for calling 911? Well, in an ambiguous situation where her safety is at risk, calling the police is a reasonable action. The law is supposed to protect citizens, so using 911 in a perceived threat is justified. The man wasn't armed or inside, but she couldn't know that. The police arrived and resolved it, showing no harm came from her call. \n\nHowever, there's also the context of systemic issues where Black individuals face disproportionate attention from police. Her friends acknowledge this, and she's aware of it. The question is whether her action, though based on fear, contributes to a problematic pattern. But she didn't describe the man based on race, so the race wasn't a factor in her decision. \n\nThe backlash might be valid in pointing out that sometimes people overreact without cause, which can lead to harmful outcomes. Yet, in her case, the police found the man, and there was no violence. Her intent wasn't to harm but to protect herself. \n\nSo, considering both sides: her fear and actions are understandable, especially in a vulnerable situation. She didn't act with malice or racial intent. The backlash, while raising important issues, might be misapplying her case to broader systemic problems. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. But she's also justified in being upset about the accusations, as they don't align with her intent.\n"
