He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves a 15-year-old son who's upset because his cat, Spacey, was rehomed. The parent is in a new relationship with someone who has a severe cat allergy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're in a new relationship, and their partner can't be around cats. The parent might feel that keeping the cat is affecting their ability to have a serious relationship. They also mention that their husband passed away, which adds emotional weight to their decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is very attached to the cat. He's taken care of Spacey for 7 years, and the cat is a big part of his life. The son's reaction\u2014yelling and calling the parent selfish\u2014shows how hurt he is. Parents are responsible for their children's emotional well-being, so removing a pet that the child loves could be seen as a mistake.\n\nBut the parent might argue that they didn't realize how important the cat was to the son. Maybe they didn't communicate enough with the son before making the decision. Rehoming a pet is a big step, and it's possible the parent didn't consider all alternatives, like getting the cat tested for hypoallergenic traits or finding a different solution for the partner's allergy.\n\nI should also think about the partner's allergy. If it's severe, the parent might feel it's necessary for their own happiness and the relationship. However, the son's emotional needs are also significant. The parent's responsibility includes balancing their own needs with their child's well-being.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the parent could have tried to find another solution, like using air purifiers, keeping the cat in a specific area, or even moving out temporarily. But the parent didn't mention these options, so it's unclear if they were considered.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent might be prioritizing their own happiness over their son's, which could be seen as selfish. However, they might feel that after their husband's death, they deserve to find someone new. The son's anger is understandable because he feels displaced or that his needs were overlooked.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. They made a decision without considering their son's feelings, but they also have valid reasons related to their new relationship. The parent's mistake might be not communicating with the son first or not exploring all alternatives. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because they acted without considering their son's emotional impact, but there are mitigating factors.\n"
