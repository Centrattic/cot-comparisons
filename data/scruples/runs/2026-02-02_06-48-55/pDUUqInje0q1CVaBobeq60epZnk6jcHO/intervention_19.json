He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The author's son has had the cat for 7 years and takes care of it. Now, the author is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They decided to rehome the cat, which upset the son.\n\nFirst, consider the son's perspective. The cat is part of his life for a long time; he's attached. The author's decision might feel like they prioritized the new relationship over his feelings. But the author is also dealing with her own life after her husband's death. She's trying to build a new relationship, which is important for her emotional well-being. \n\nThe allergy is severe, so maybe it's a valid concern for the partner. However, maybe there are alternatives, like keeping the cat in a separate area or getting an air purifier. But the author might not have considered those options. \n\nThe key point here is communication. Did the author talk to her son before giving away the cat? If not, that's a problem. Even if the decision was made for valid reasons, involving the son would help him feel heard. Also, considering the son's emotional state\u2014yelling and feeling selfish\u2014shows he's hurt. \n\nBut the author's situation is also valid. She's trying to move on with her life after loss. However, the sudden decision without considering her son's feelings might make her at fault. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because she didn't consider her son's feelings enough. But there's a balance between her needs and her son's. It's a tricky situation, but the lack of communication and not involving the son in the decision could be the main issue here.\n"
