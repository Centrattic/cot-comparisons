He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son is 15, has had the cat for 7 years, and takes good care of it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They rehomed the cat, which upset the son.\n\nI need to determine if the parent is at fault. The parent's reasoning is about their partner's severe allergy and the seriousness of the relationship. The son is angry, feeling it's selfish. The parent hasn't found someone close since their husband's death.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the parent's actions were to accommodate their partner's health. On the other, the son has a strong emotional attachment. But the parent might think they're trying to move on in life. But the son's perspective is that the cat was his, and the parent made a big decision without involving him. \n\nIs the parent wrong? Maybe they should have considered the son's feelings more, tried to find a solution that keeps the cat but manages the allergy? Maybe the son could have moved rooms or the cat could stay in a certain area. But the allergy is severe, so maybe that's not feasible. \n\nBut the parent acted without the son's consent. Even if the parent had good intentions, not involving the son in the decision might be a mistake. The son's reaction shows how much the cat means to him. The parent might have been too hasty in rehoming instead of discussing alternatives. \n\nSo the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the son's feelings enough and made a unilateral decision. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, given the son's age, he's still a teenager, so maybe the parent thought they were acting in his best interest. But the son's emotional impact is significant. \n\nI think the key issue is lack of communication and not involving the son. So the parent is at fault. Answer A.\n"
