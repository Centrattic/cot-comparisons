It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving away her son's cat. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe mom has a 15-year-old son who has had his cat, Spacey, for 7 years. The son loves the cat and takes care of it. Now, the mom is dating someone who's severely allergic to cats. She's been seeing this person for a few months and things are getting serious. She decided to rehome the cat because her partner can't handle the allergy. The son is upset, calling her selfish and throwing Spacey away for a man she hasn't known long. The mom mentions that since her husband's death, this is the first person she's connected with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's perspective: she's in a new serious relationship, her partner's health is a concern. She wants to make the relationship work. She might feel that keeping the cat would cause ongoing issues for her partner. Also, she might feel that the son is now older, maybe more independent, and capable of understanding the decision.\n\nBut the son has had the cat for years. The cat is part of his life, and suddenly giving it away could be traumatic. The son's reaction is anger and feeling that his mom is prioritizing the new partner over his well-being. The mom's decision might not have considered the son's emotional attachment adequately. Did she talk to the son about it first? The post says she didn't mention consulting the son, which could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's partner has a severe allergy, which isn't trivial. If they want to be together, maybe some changes are necessary. But maybe there are alternatives? Like getting an allergy treatment, using air purifiers, or maybe the cat could be rehomed in a way that's less abrupt, giving the son time to adjust.\n\nThe mom's reasoning includes that she hasn't found someone she clicked with before, implying she wanted to make this relationship work. However, the son's bond with the cat is long-standing. The decision to rehome without the son's input might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. Even if the allergy is severe, maybe involving the son in finding a solution could have been better. The son feeling \"thrown away\" because of the new partner might indicate that the mom didn't balance both her needs and her son's.\n\nPossible angles: Is the mom overstepping by making a decision that affects her son without his consent? The cat was the son's, so maybe she should have involved him more. Alternatively, the mom might be trying to move on with her life after her husband's death, which is understandable. But the way she handled it could be problematic.\n\nI think the key here is whether the mom considered her son's feelings and involved him in the decision. If she didn't, then she's at fault. If she did and he still resisted, maybe not. But the post doesn't indicate she did consult him. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong). But maybe B if the allergy is a valid reason and she had no other options. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The son's reaction is valid, so maybe the mom should have found another solution, like finding a new home for the cat while involving the son, or discussing alternatives with her partner. So, the answer is A.\n"
