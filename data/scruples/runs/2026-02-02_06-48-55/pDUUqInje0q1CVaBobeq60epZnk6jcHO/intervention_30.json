He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son has had the cat for seven years, and he really loves it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy, and they decided to rehome the cat to make things easier for the new partner. The son is upset, calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they're trying to make their new relationship work because the allergy is severe. On the other hand, the son has been caring for the cat for years, so losing the pet is a big deal for him. The parent mentions their late husband, which adds emotional weight\u2014maybe they're trying to find happiness again but are making a sacrifice that affects their child deeply.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the cat belongs to the son, so giving it away without his consent could be seen as disregarding his feelings. Even if the parent thought it was for the best, not involving the son in the decision might have been a mistake. Also, maybe there were alternatives, like finding an allergy-friendly solution or discussing the issue with the boyfriend. However, the parent's actions stem from wanting to maintain the relationship, which is understandable. The key points are consent, emotional impact on the child, and possible alternatives.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong since they're dealing with their own life and trying to manage a new relationship. But they did make a decision that significantly affected their son without his input, which could be seen as selfish. The son's reaction is valid because the cat was a big part of his life. However, the parent's intention wasn't malicious. So maybe the answer isn't black and white. But the user initially thought the parent is in the wrong. Need to decide if giving away someone else's pet without their consent is wrong, regardless of the reason. Since the cat is the son's, the parent shouldn't have given it away without discussing. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
