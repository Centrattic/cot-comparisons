He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's son is 15 and has had the cat, Spacey, for 7 years. The son takes good care of the cat, and they have a strong bond. The author recently started dating someone with a severe cat allergy, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, accused the author of being selfish, and the author is feeling conflicted, especially after the loss of their husband.\n\nNow, the main issue here is balancing the son's emotional well-being versus the author's new relationship. On one hand, the son has a long-term connection with the cat, and losing a pet can be very traumatic, especially for a teenager. The author's decision might come across as prioritizing the new partner's health over the son's feelings. On the other hand, the author is dealing with the grief of their husband's death and is navigating a new relationship where a serious allergy is a real health issue. The datee's allergy isn't life-threatening but is severe enough to affect their time together. The author might feel that rehoming the cat is necessary to maintain the relationship, which is important to them after being alone for a while.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the son wasn't consulted in the decision. The author took a major step without considering the son's feelings, which could be seen as dismissive of his emotional attachment. The son's reaction is understandable given the bond with the cat. The author might have found a compromise, like finding a place for the cat where the son can still visit, or maybe setting up a space in the house that's cat-free for the partner. However, the author's actions were done out of their own needs and perhaps a lack of communication with the son. \n\nI think the author's intentions might not be malicious, but the handling of the situation is what's questionable. The key here is the lack of communication and considering the son's perspective. The author might not be in the wrong if they had a valid reason and communicated properly, but in this case, the decision was made unilaterally, which could make them at fault. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve the son in the decision and the son's feelings were overlooked. But I also need to consider that the author is dealing with their own emotional needs after losing their spouse, which complicates things. However, the son's right to have his feelings considered is important. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
