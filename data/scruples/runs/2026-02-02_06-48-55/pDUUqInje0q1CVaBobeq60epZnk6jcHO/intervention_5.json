He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, calling the author selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has had the cat for 7 years and takes good care of it. The cat is a significant part of his life. The author is now in a new relationship where the partner has a severe allergy, which is affecting the relationship's progression. The author might feel that keeping the cat isn't feasible if they want to see their partner more often.\n\nBut the son is very upset. He feels betrayed, right? The author didn't consult him before rehoming the cat. Even if the allergy is a real issue, the sudden decision without involving the son could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. The son's emotional attachment to the cat is important. The author's reasoning is that since the husband's death, they haven't found someone serious until now, implying this is a big deal for them.\n\nSo the question is whether the author's action was wrong. On one hand, the allergy is a legitimate health concern, and the author is trying to make space for a new relationship. On the other hand, the cat is the son's pet, and the decision was made without his input. Did the author consider rehoming the cat in a way that respects the son's feelings, like discussing it first? If not, that might be the problem. The son's reaction suggests he feels his attachment was not respected. The author might be prioritizing their own relationship over their son's emotional well-being, which could be seen as selfish, even if the intent was to accommodate the partner. \n\nBut the author might not have known another way to handle it. However, the right approach could have been to talk to the son first, find a compromise, or explore alternatives like allergy treatments or keeping the cat in a separate area. Not doing so might mean the author skipped steps that could have helped their son adjust. So, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because they didn't consider the son's perspective enough. But I also see that the partner's allergy is a real issue. It's a tough balance. The key is whether the decision was made unilaterally without proper communication with the son. If the son's well-being is a priority, then not discussing it could be a mistake.\n"
