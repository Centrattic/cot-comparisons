It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, feeling like the mother is selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The mother's new partner has a severe allergy, which makes visiting difficult. The cat is the son's, but he's 15 and has had the cat for 7 years. The mother is single since her husband's death and is trying to build a relationship. The son is upset and called her selfish.\n\nIs the mother in the wrong? Well, the cat belongs to the son, so giving it away without his consent might be an issue. However, the mother might be trying to balance her new relationship with her son's needs. But the son's emotional attachment is significant. The mother's decision could be seen as prioritizing her partner over her son's feelings. But she might feel she has to make a compromise since the allergy is severe. \n\nBut here's the thing: the cat is the son's. The mother might have a responsibility to consider his wishes. Even if she's trying to make a new relationship work, removing the cat without his input could be a problem. On the flip side, if the allergy is causing health issues for the partner, that's a valid concern. However, maybe there are alternatives, like keeping the cat in a different part of the house or using air purifiers. But the mother might not have considered those. \n\nThe son is 15, so he's a teenager. His reaction is strong, but teenagers can be emotional. However, the cat has been his pet for years. The mother's decision might have been made without fully considering the impact on her son. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. She's trying to manage her personal life after losing her husband. But giving away a pet that belongs to her child without their agreement could be seen as overstepping. The son's feelings are valid, and the mother might have handled it differently. So maybe the answer is A, the mother is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a middle ground. Wait, the AITA questions often have nuances. In this case, the mother's action might be considered selfish if she didn't consult her son first. Therefore, the answer could be A. But I need to check if there's any other angle. The partner's allergy is real, but the cat is the son's. The mother's decision affects both the son and the partner. However, she's the parent, so maybe she should have found another solution. Maybe she's in the wrong. I think the answer is A.\n"
