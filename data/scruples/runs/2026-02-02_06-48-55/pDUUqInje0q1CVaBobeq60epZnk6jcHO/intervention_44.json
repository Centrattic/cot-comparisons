He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, thinking the mom was selfish. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's perspective: she's trying to make a relationship work, her partner has a severe allergy, and she can't have him over often. She's been alone since her husband died. She might feel this is necessary for her happiness and the relationship's future.\n\nThe son's perspective: he's 15, has had the cat for 7 years, loves the cat, and feels betrayed. He might see his mom prioritizing a new partner over his feelings. The cat is part of his life, and losing it could be traumatic.\n\nIs the mom right to prioritize her new relationship over her son's feelings? The cat is the son's, even though it's in the house. Rehoming it without his input could be seen as dismissive. However, the mom might not see another option if the allergy is severe and the relationship is serious.\n\nBut maybe there are alternatives. Could they get an allergy-friendly environment? Maybe the partner could take medication, or they could find a way to manage the cat's presence. The mom didn't mention trying those solutions. Also, involving the son in the decision could have helped him adjust better.\n\nThe son's anger is justified because he feels his attachment was ignored. The mom's action might have long-term effects on their relationship. However, the mom is dealing with loneliness and a new relationship, which is understandable. But the way she handled it without considering the son's feelings might be the issue.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. The decision itself has valid reasons, but the method\u2014without involving the son\u2014might be problematic. So leaning towards AITA, the author is in the wrong because she prioritized her new partner without adequately considering her son's emotional well-being and involved him in the decision-making process.\n"
