He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author has a 15-year-old son who has had a cat named Spacey for seven years. He takes good care of it, and the cat is a big part of his life. The author is now dating someone who is severely allergic to cats\u2014not just a mild reaction but something significant. They've been serious for a few months, and because of the allergy, the partner can't visit often. The author decided to rehome the cat, which caused the son to be very upset, even yelling and calling the author selfish. The author is single since her husband died and hasn't met someone she connected with before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The son has a strong bond with the cat, but the author's new relationship is causing a conflict. The partner's health is a valid concern. The author might be trying to balance her own happiness and the relationship with her son's feelings.\n\nBut the son is a teenager, and while he's in a critical developmental stage, the cat is his responsibility. However, the parent might have the legal authority to make such a decision. But the emotional impact on the son is significant. Did the author consult her son before giving up the cat? The son feels like his pet was thrown away for a new partner, which might make him feel undervalued.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with grief and seeking companionship. The partner's allergy is a real issue that affects their relationship. Maybe the author thought giving up the cat was the only solution, but perhaps there were other options, like finding an allergy-friendly environment or maybe the partner could manage it in another way. However, the severity of the allergy might limit those options.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing her new relationship over her son's emotional needs? Or is she justified in trying to maintain a relationship that's important to her, given her past loss?\n\nIt's a tough call. The son's reaction is understandable, but the author's decision is based on her own circumstances. The answer might hinge on whether the author considered alternatives or communicated with her son. If she didn't involve him in the decision, that could be a point against her. If she did, maybe it's more complex. But the story doesn't mention if she discussed it with her son first. The son yelled at her, implying he wasn't consulted or didn't agree.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. She made a decision that affected her son's emotional well-being without considering his input. But she's also in a vulnerable position after her husband's death. The partner's health is a valid concern. The answer might be that the author is partially at fault but not entirely. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the son's emotional impact is significant, maybe the author is at least partially to blame. However, the partner's allergy is a real issue. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are binary, the author might be in the wrong if she didn't consider alternatives or her son's feelings. However, if she had to make a choice between her son's cat and her relationship, maybe it's a tough situation. But the son is a teenager, and losing a pet can be traumatic. The author might not be in the wrong if she had to make a practical decision, but maybe there were other solutions. Since the story doesn't mention trying other options, maybe she's at fault. Hmm. Alternatively, the partner's allergy is a serious health issue, so the author's reasoning is valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's making a difficult decision to prioritize her own happiness and her partner's health, though it's a sensitive situation. The son's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if she didn't involve the son in the decision, maybe she is. The story doesn't specify if she discussed it with him first. If she didn't, then she might be in the wrong. The son feels it's selfish, but the author's perspective is that it's necessary. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and there's no mention of alternatives being explored (like using air filters, keeping the cat in a certain room, or the partner taking medication), perhaps the author could have looked for other solutions. If she didn't, maybe she is in the wrong. However, if the allergy is severe and those options aren't feasible, then it's a tough call. \n\nGiven that the partner's allergy is severe and the author is balancing her son's needs against her own happiness, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
