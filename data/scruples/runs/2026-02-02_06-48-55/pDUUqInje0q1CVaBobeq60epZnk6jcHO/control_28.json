He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. The mother is in a new relationship where the partner is severely allergic to cats. She decided to rehome the cat, which upset her son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's trying to balance her current relationship and her son's feelings. Her husband has passed away, so she's looking for companionship, but the allergy is a real issue. She might believe that rehoming the cat is necessary for her relationship to progress. But then there's her son's emotional well-being. The son loves the cat, so giving it away could make him feel that his mother is prioritizing someone else over him, especially since he's still a teenager and might be sensitive about such things.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that she's not in the wrong because she's trying to move on and form a new relationship. The allergy is severe enough that the partner can't visit often, which could affect the relationship's future. However, she should have considered her son's feelings and maybe involved him more in the decision. Perhaps a compromise could have been made, like finding another living arrangement for the cat or discussing it with the partner for possible solutions. The fact that the son is upset and accuses her of being selfish suggests that her approach might have been too abrupt without considering his emotional impact.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's right to pursue a new relationship and her responsibility to her son. The decision to give away a pet, especially one the son considers his own, is significant. The mother might have thought it was the best solution, but she should have involved her son in the process, ensuring he felt heard and valued. The answer hinges on whether the decision was made unilaterally without considering the son's attachment and input. If she didn't consult her son and acted solely on her own, that could be seen as wrong. However, if she had discussed it and considered his feelings, maybe the outcome would be different. Since the situation shows the son being upset and the mother's decision leading to conflict, the mother might be in the wrong for not addressing her son's feelings adequately.\n"
