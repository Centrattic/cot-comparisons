It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because the new partner is severely allergic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son is 15, has had the cat for 7 years, and takes good care of it. The parent is dating someone with a severe allergy, and they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, feeling it's selfish. The parent mentions they haven't found someone they really connected with since their husband's death.\n\nHmm. So the parent's motivation is to make their new relationship work because of allergies. But the son is upset because the cat was his and he's attached. The parent might feel they're doing the right thing for the relationship, but maybe didn't consider the son's feelings enough.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the parent is trying to accommodate a new partner's health needs. On the other hand, the cat was the son's, and the parent didn't consult him properly. The son's emotional reaction suggests he felt his needs were overlooked. The parent might have rushed into the decision without involving the son, leading to hurt feelings. The parent's reasoning is valid, but the way they handled it could be the issue. Maybe they could have tried alternative solutions first, like separating the cat from the partner's space, or discussing it more with the son. So, perhaps the parent is partly at fault for not handling the situation more sensitively. But is that enough to say they're in the wrong? \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider if there's a right and wrong here or if it's more nuanced. The parent's action might be seen as prioritizing the new relationship over the son's emotional well-being. However, the parent is also dealing with their own loneliness and trying to move forward. The severity of the allergy is a real factor. It's a tough call. But if the parent didn't give the son a chance to be part of the decision, that's a problem. Maybe the parent should have explored alternatives before giving up the cat. So, the answer might be A, the parent is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong because they had a valid reason. The AITA community often looks at intentions and communication. If the parent didn't communicate well with the son, that's a flaw. However, the situation is complex. I think the parent's intentions are understandable, but the execution could be better. So maybe the answer is A. Wait, but sometimes in AITA, if someone has a valid reason but the way they handled it was poor, they might be considered not in the wrong. I'm a bit confused. The parent made a decision without adequate discussion, leading to the son's distress. That might make the parent responsible, so answer A. But maybe the parent is not in the wrong because they were trying to manage a serious allergy issue. Hmm. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
