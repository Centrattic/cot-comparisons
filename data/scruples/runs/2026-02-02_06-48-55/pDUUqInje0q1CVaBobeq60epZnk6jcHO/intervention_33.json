He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for giving away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. The mother took the decision without consulting the son, which led to him being upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's dating someone with a severe allergy, so keeping the cat might affect her partner's health. Also, she mentions that since her husband's death, she hasn't met someone she clicks with, implying this relationship is important to her. But the son is clearly attached to the cat, and the decision was made without his input. \n\nNow, the son is 15, which is a teenager. He's responsible for the cat, and he's been taking care of it for years. The mother took Spacey away without discussing it with him, which might have been a big betrayal. The son's reaction is understandable\u2014feeling like his mother is prioritizing a new relationship over his feelings and the cat's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is dealing with her own needs and the health of her partner. Maybe she felt there was no other solution. But was there a way to find a compromise? Like setting up a cat-free area in the house, maybe getting an air purifier, or even finding a temporary solution while the son adjusts. \n\nThe severity of the allergy is mentioned as not life-threatening but pretty severe. That means the partner's quality of life might be affected significantly. However, the son's emotional well-being is also important. \n\nSo, the key points here are the lack of communication with the son, the sudden decision, and the impact on both the son and the partner. The mother might have good intentions, but the way she handled it could be seen as dismissive of her son's feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother is the parent, so she has a duty to consider her child's well-being. Taking away something the son loves without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the situation is complex because it also involves the mother's new relationship and her partner's health. \n\nI think the mother made a mistake by not involving her son in the decision. Maybe there were other alternatives they could have explored together. But whether she's in the wrong entirely depends on the balance between her partner's health and her son's emotional needs. Since the son was the primary caretaker, the decision's impact is more on him. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, the mother is in the wrong because she didn't consider her son's feelings and took away his pet without discussion. But I'm not entirely sure because the partner's allergy is a valid issue. But in terms of fault, the lack of communication is a key point.\n"
