He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, thinking the mother is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother has a 15-year-old son who's had the cat for 7 years. The cat is a big part of his life. The mother is dating someone with a severe allergy. They've been serious for a few months, and she can't have the partner over often because of the allergy. She decided to rehome the cat, which upset the son.\n\nNow, the question is whether she made the wrong choice. On one hand, the mother is trying to make a practical decision for her relationship. On the other hand, the son is grieving his father's death and might feel the cat is a comfort. The mother might be trying to balance her happiness with her son's needs.\n\nBut is she selfish? The son says she's throwing away the cat for a new partner. However, the mother hasn't been in a relationship since her husband's death, implying she's found someone she connects with. The allergy is severe, so keeping the cat might make it hard for the partner to visit, affecting the relationship.\n\nBut the son's well-being is also a factor. At 15, the son is still young and might see the cat as a significant companion. The mother's decision could be causing emotional distress. However, she might believe that maintaining her relationship is important too. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. Is there a middle ground? Maybe trying to find a hypoallergenic solution or getting a separate living space for the cat? But maybe those options aren't feasible. The mother might not have considered alternatives, but she did rehome the cat, which is a responsible action. \n\nIs she at fault? Well, communicating with the son about the decision could have helped. Maybe the son felt blindsided. But the situation is complex. The mother's actions are based on her current circumstances. It's hard to say if she's entirely wrong. Maybe she's in a tough spot, trying to balance her and her son's needs. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. She made a difficult decision with good intentions, though communication could have been better. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Since she tried to act in the best interest of her relationship, even if it caused her son distress, maybe she's not wrong. Alternatively, some might argue she should have prioritized her son's feelings more. But given the information, B seems plausible.\n"
