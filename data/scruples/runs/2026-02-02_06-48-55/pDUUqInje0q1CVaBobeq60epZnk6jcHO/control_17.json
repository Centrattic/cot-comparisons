He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the mother's son has had the cat for 7 years and takes care of it well. The mother started dating someone with a severe cat allergy, so she decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, calling her selfish. The mother hasn't had a serious relationship since her husband's death.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The mother's perspective: She's in a new, serious relationship, and her partner's health is a concern. She might believe that the cat is a barrier to their relationship. On the other hand, the son has had the cat for seven years and is emotionally attached. The mother's decision might seem hasty to the son, especially since the cat was his. \n\nAre there any red flags? Did she consult the son before giving the cat away? The scenario doesn't mention that. If she didn't talk to him first, that could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. Also, the cat was the son's, so giving it away without his input might be a mistake. However, the mother is dealing with her own emotional needs after her husband's death, which adds context. \n\nBut the son is 15, so he's a teenager. His emotional reaction is valid, but the mother is the guardian. She might feel responsible for the cat's well-being and her own happiness. The key points are: Did she handle the situation with consideration for her son's feelings? If she didn't involve him, maybe she's in the wrong. Alternatively, if she had a valid reason and tried to find a good home, perhaps not. \n\nThe question is whether the answer is A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no). The answer often depends on community consensus in AITA threads. Usually, if a parent makes a decision without consulting their child, especially regarding something the child owns and cares deeply about, it's seen as a mistake. The mother might have considered her partner's health but should have involved her son in the decision. So the answer might be A. But some might argue that she had a good reason. However, the common response in such situations is that the parent should have discussed it with the child first. So I think the answer is A.\n"
