He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, calling them selfish. The author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son has had the cat for 7 years, loves it, and takes good care of it. The parent had to rehome the cat due to the partner's severe allergy. The parent is single after the husband's death, and this partner is serious.\n\nSo, the parent's decision is based on the relationship's progression and the partner's health. But the son is a minor, 15, and the cat was his. The parent made the decision without the son's input, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, the parent's intention was to accommodate their new relationship. However, the son's well-being and emotional attachment to the cat are significant. The parent might not have considered the son's perspective adequately, perhaps acting too quickly without trying alternatives like a cat-friendly partner or other solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is dealing with their own loneliness and a new serious relationship. But the son's age and the cat's long-term presence in his life suggest that the decision should have involved more discussion with the son. The parent might be prioritizing their new relationship over the son's feelings, which could be seen as selfish, as the son accused.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the decision was made without considering the son's feelings and the long-term bond. However, there's also the aspect of the parent's new relationship and health concerns. But the main issue is the lack of communication and the son's emotional impact. So, maybe A is the right choice.\n"
