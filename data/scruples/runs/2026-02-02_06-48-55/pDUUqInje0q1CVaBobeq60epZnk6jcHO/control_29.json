He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son is 15, has had the cat for 7 years, takes good care of it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They decided to rehome the cat because they can't have their partner over often. The son got upset, called the parent selfish, and the parent is wondering if they made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On the parent's side, they're trying to balance their son's needs with their new relationship. The allergy is severe, which complicates things. They mention that since the husband's death, they haven't found someone they connected with before. So maybe they're trying to make this relationship work. But the son is clearly affected, upset, and feels the cat was thrown away for a new partner.\n\nThe parent's decision might be seen as prioritizing the new relationship over the son's emotional well-being. However, the parent might argue that they had to find a solution that allows their partner to be part of their life, and they might have tried to involve the son in the decision-making, but the son still felt it was sudden. But the parent didn't mention discussing with the son first. If they didn't talk to him, that could be a problem. If they did, maybe the son still felt unheard.\n\nAlso, the cat's welfare is a factor. Rehoming to a good home could be necessary, but the parent needs to ensure that the cat is placed properly. But the question is about the parent's responsibility. The parent's actions might be seen as selfish if they didn't consider the son's feelings enough. However, the parent is dealing with their own emotional state since the husband's death. Maybe they feel lonely and want to make the relationship work, but the son is still grieving or in a stage where he's very attached to the cat.\n\nIt's a tough call. The parent could have involved the son more, maybe explored alternatives like medication for the allergy, or a hypoallergenic cat, but that's not feasible. But maybe the parent felt that rehoming was the only option. The answer might depend on whether there was communication and if the parent considered the son's feelings adequately. If the parent didn't communicate and just decided on their own, then they might be in the wrong. If they did try to involve the son but he was still upset, maybe not. The question doesn't specify if they discussed it with the son. Since the son yelled and felt it was selfish, the parent might not have handled the communication well. So the answer could be A, but I need to check the details again.\n\nWait, the parent says \"I decided to rehome Spacey\" without mentioning consulting the son. The son wasn't involved in the decision. That's a key point. The cat was the son's, so the parent should have considered the son's wishes. Even though the parent has their reasons, the son's reaction suggests that the decision was made without his input. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not involving the son in such an important decision. So answer A.\n"
