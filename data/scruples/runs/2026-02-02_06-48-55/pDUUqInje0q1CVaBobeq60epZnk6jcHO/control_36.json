It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic to cats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. He clearly cares for the cat a lot. The parent is in a new relationship where the partner has a severe allergy, which is making it hard for them to be together. The parent decided to rehome the cat, which upset the son. The son feels his parent was selfish and gave up the cat too quickly for someone they haven't known long. The parent mentions that since the husband's death, they haven't met someone they clicked with, implying they might be looking for a new relationship.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: they're in a new relationship that's becoming more serious. Allergies can be a significant issue, especially if it's severe. They might be trying to make the relationship work by removing the allergen. However, the son is a teenager who's emotionally attached to the cat. Removing the cat could affect his well-being. The parent's decision might be seen as prioritizing their new partner's health over the son's emotional needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might not have considered the son's feelings enough. Did they try to find another solution, like using air purifiers, keeping the cat out of certain areas, or getting tested for the allergy? If they didn't explore alternatives, that could be a problem. But if they did and still decided to rehome the cat, maybe it's a necessary step for the relationship.\n\nThe son's reaction is understandable. At 15, losing a pet you've had for seven years is a big deal. Feeling like your parent is being selfish because they're choosing someone else over your long-time companion can lead to resentment.\n\nHowever, the parent's loneliness since the husband's death might be a factor. They might be trying to move on and build a new life with someone, which is valid. The conflict here is between the son's emotional attachment and the parent's attempt to start a new relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent is the guardian, so they have a duty to consider the child's well-being. But they also have their own needs. The key might be whether they involved the son in the decision or gave him a chance to adjust. If they just took the cat away without discussion, that's a problem. If they tried to explain and maybe find a compromise, it's different.\n\nThe question is whether the parent was wrong. The answer could hinge on whether alternatives were explored and if the son's feelings were adequately considered. Since the parent didn't mention trying other solutions, maybe they acted hastily. But the situation is complex, and both sides have valid points. It's tricky, but I think the parent might be in the wrong for not considering the son's feelings more and not exploring other options before giving up the cat.\n"
