He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, thinking the mom was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom's reasoning is that the new partner has a severe allergy, and they're getting serious. So she can't have him visit often because of the cat. She also mentions that her husband passed away, and she hasn't found someone she clicked with before. So maybe she's prioritizing her new relationship here.\n\nOn the other hand, the son had the cat for seven years and really loves it. The mom decided to give away the cat without the son's consent. The son feels it's selfish because the mom hasn't been with the partner long. The question is whether the mom made the right decision.\n\nI should think about the ethical aspects. Does the mom have the right to make that decision? The cat was the son's, so maybe the son should have had a say. But the mom is also considering her own needs and the partner's allergy. However, the son is 15, which is a minor, so the mom is the decision-maker. But maybe she should have discussed it more with her son instead of just giving the cat away.\n\nAlso, the severity of the allergy matters. If it's a serious health issue, the mom has to consider that. But maybe there were other options, like finding an environment where the cat could be kept away from the partner, or using air purifiers, maybe even rehoming the cat to another relative or friend.\n\nThe son's reaction is understandable because losing a pet is hard. The mom's decision might be seen as prioritizing her new relationship over her son's feelings. But she might have felt that the new relationship is important for her well-being after losing her husband.\n\nIt's a tough balance. The mom might not be in the wrong because she's an adult making decisions for her household, but she might have mishandled the situation by not involving her son enough. So it's possible she's not entirely at fault, but maybe she should have handled it differently.\n"
