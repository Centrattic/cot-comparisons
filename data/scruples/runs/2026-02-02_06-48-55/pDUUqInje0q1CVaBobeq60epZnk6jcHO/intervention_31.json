He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, feeling it's selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's reasoning: they want a serious relationship, and the partner can't be around the cat. The son has had the cat for seven years and is very attached. The parent might feel they have to choose between their son's pet and their new relationship. But is that a valid reason?\n\nOn the other hand, the son is 15, so he's a teenager. His emotional attachment is significant. Taking away a pet he's cared for might be seen as dismissing his feelings. The parent didn't consult the son, which could be a problem. Maybe there were other options, like finding an allergy-friendly environment, or maybe the partner could manage the allergy with medication. But the parent didn't mention exploring those solutions.\n\nThe parent's husband died, so they're dealing with grief and looking for companionship. That adds context but doesn't excuse the action. The key question is whether there was a better way to handle it. Did they consider alternatives? If the allergy is severe, maybe rehoming is necessary, but the way it was handled without the son's input might be the issue.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? If they didn't involve the son and didn't consider alternatives, maybe yes. But if the allergy is too severe for any other solution, maybe not. The answer depends on whether there were other options and if the parent acted unilaterally. The story says the parent didn't know what else to do. Maybe they felt pressured. But the son's reaction shows the decision hurt him. Balancing both sides, the parent might be in the wrong for not involving the son and not considering alternatives. But if there were no other options, maybe not. Hmm.\n"
