He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away her son's cat. The situation is that her son has had the cat for 7 years, loves it, and takes care of it. She's dating someone with a severe allergy, so she decided to rehome the cat to make her new relationship work. The son is upset and called her selfish.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the son's feelings. The cat has been his pet for a long time; he's attached to it. The decision to give it away might have been made without his input, which could be why he feels betrayed. But on the other hand, the mother's perspective is that she's trying to maintain a new relationship after her husband's death. She hasn't been in a serious relationship in a while, so this is important to her.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, the cat is the son's pet, meaning the son owns it. If the mother took that away without consulting him, that's a problem. Even if the allergy is real, the right approach might have been to discuss options with the son first. Maybe they could have found another solution, like keeping the cat in a different part of the house or getting an air purifier. The mother's decision to rehome it without considering her son's feelings and ownership could be seen as acting unilaterally.\n\nBut also, the mother's emotional needs are valid. After losing her husband, finding someone she connects with is significant. However, the way she handled the situation might have been insensitive. The son's reaction is understandable because the cat is a big part of his life. The author might not be in the wrong if she acted with good intentions, but the method could be questionable. She should have involved her son in the decision-making process. So maybe the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong because she didn't consider her son's role as the owner and his emotional attachment.\n"
