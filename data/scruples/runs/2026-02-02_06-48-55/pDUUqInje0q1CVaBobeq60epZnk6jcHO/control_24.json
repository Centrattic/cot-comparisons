It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a 15-year-old son who's had a cat named Spacey for seven years. The son loves the cat, takes care of it, and the cat is part of his daily life. The author is now dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They're getting serious, so the author decided to rehome the cat to avoid allergy issues. The son is upset, yelling that the author was selfish. The author didn't have a partner since her husband's death and felt this was the only option.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision affects her son's emotional well-being. The cat is a long-term companion for the son, and giving it away suddenly can cause distress. The son's reaction is understandable; losing a pet is traumatic, especially when it feels like it's for someone else's comfort. The author didn't consult the son, which might have been a mistake. There's also the aspect of whether there are alternatives, like finding a non-allergic partner or using air purifiers.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with her own needs and the need to build a relationship. The allergy is severe, so compromising her new relationship for the cat's sake could be a valid concern. However, the key point here is the author's approach. Making such a significant decision without involving her son could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. The son's care for the cat is evident, so the author might have explored other options, like finding a new home for the cat with the son's input or ensuring the son was on board.\n\nPossible alternatives: Maybe the author could have discussed the situation with her son first, considered other allergy management techniques, or found a way to keep the cat but still accommodate her partner. The fact that the son is 15 means he's old enough to be involved in such decisions. The author's lack of communication here seems problematic. Even if the decision was necessary, the method of handling it without the son's consent might be where she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be understandable, the way she handled the situation\u2014especially without considering her son's feelings and not consulting him\u2014could make her at fault. The son's emotional state is significant here. The author prioritized her relationship over her son's emotional well-being without considering alternatives or his input. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
