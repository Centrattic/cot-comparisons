It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves a 15-year-old son who loves his cat, Spacey, which he's had for seven years. The parent started dating someone with a severe cat allergy, leading them to rehome the cat. The son is upset, feeling it's selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They lost their husband, so forming a new relationship might be significant. The allergy is severe enough that they can't have the partner over often, which affects their relationship. However, the son is 15, so he's still a minor, and the cat is his pet. The parent made the decision without consulting the son, which could be seen as not respecting his feelings or ownership.\n\nFrom the son's side, losing a pet that's been part of his life for seven years is a big deal. The emotional bond is strong, and being yelled at indicates he's hurt. The son might feel the parent prioritized the new partner over his well-being. The parent's reasoning is about their own happiness, but they might not have considered the son's emotional impact sufficiently.\n\nLegal ownership is a factor. If the cat is legally the son's, the parent shouldn't unilaterally decide to rehome it without the child's consent. However, if the parent is the legal guardian, there's a gray area. Emotionally, the parent's actions might be seen as prioritizing their own needs over the child's, which could be selfish, but the parent might argue they're trying to balance their own happiness with the son's future.\n\nOther factors: The parent's isolation after their husband's death might make the new relationship important. But the son is still dependent on them, so the parent's responsibility includes considering their child's welfare. The severity of the allergy is real, but alternatives like medication or keeping the cat in a specific area weren't mentioned. The parent might not have explored all options before deciding.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision might be seen as wrong because they didn't involve the son in the decision, didn't consider alternatives, and prioritized their own needs without sufficient regard for the son's emotional state. However, some might argue the parent is trying to find happiness after loss. The key issue is the lack of consultation and the sudden rehoming without considering the son's perspective. So the answer might be A, but there are nuances.\n"
