He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son has had the cat for 7 years, loves it, and takes care of it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They decided to rehome the cat because they can't have the partner over often. The son is upset, calling the parent selfish.\n\nI need to determine if the parent is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. The parent's actions were based on their new relationship's needs. The allergy is severe, which suggests it's a real issue. However, the cat has been with the son for a long time, and the son is clearly attached. The parent might have considered the partner's health but didn't consult the son first, which could be a problem. \n\nWas there communication? The parent says they decided to rehome the cat. If they didn't talk to the son beforehand, that's a mistake. The son's well-being and emotional attachment should be considered. The parent's previous loss (husband's death) might add context to their loneliness, but that doesn't justify not involving the son. \n\nIs the parent wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, the allergy is a valid health concern. On the other, the son's emotional impact was significant. The key might be whether the parent made an effort to find a solution that respects both the partner's allergy and the son's feelings. Maybe there were alternatives, like moving the cat to a separate area, using air purifiers, or finding a different living arrangement for the cat without giving it away. Also, giving away a pet that's been with someone for years is a big decision that should involve the child. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the son's feelings and the bond between the son and the cat. The answer could be A, the parent is in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. The parent had a valid reason, but the way they handled it was flawed. However, according to the question, the choices are A or B. Given the lack of communication and the long-term bond, I think the parent is at least partially at fault.\n"
