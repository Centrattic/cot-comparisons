It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves a 15-year-old son who's upset because the parent gave away his cat, Spacey, due to the parent's new partner's severe cat allergy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. The parent is in a serious relationship now and the partner can't be around cats because of a severe allergy. The parent mentions that since the husband's death, they haven't met someone they clicked with. So, they're trying to make this relationship work, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the son has had the cat for seven years and is very attached. He's upset, called the parent selfish, and the parent is now questioning their decision. The key here is balancing the son's emotional well-being with the parent's need to maintain a healthy relationship.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the parent could have discussed rehoming the cat with the son, considering his feelings. But the parent might have acted quickly without consulting the son enough, leading to his anger. However, the parent's new partner's health is a valid concern. Allergies can be serious, and if the partner can't be around the cat, it's difficult to maintain the relationship.\n\nBut the son is a teenager, and losing a pet he's been with for so long is a big deal. The parent might not have considered the son's emotional impact enough. Maybe they could have found another solution, like getting an air purifier or keeping the cat in a separate area, but if the allergy is severe, that might not work. \n\nAlternatively, the parent could have waited longer to see if the relationship progresses, giving the son time to adjust. However, the parent might feel it's important to address the allergy issue early on. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent has a duty to their own happiness and relationships, but also to their son's emotional health. It's a tough call. The parent's actions might be seen as prioritizing their new partner over their son's feelings, which could be selfish. On the flip side, they might be trying to build a future relationship while also considering the son's care for the cat. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent considered alternatives and communicated with the son. If they didn't involve the son in the decision and didn't explore other options, they might be in the wrong. However, if they had a valid reason and tried their best, maybe not. The fact that the son is so upset suggests the parent might have overlooked his feelings. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the son's feelings enough and acted without his input. But there's a strong argument that the parent is trying to manage their own relationship, which is complex. However, the son's long-term bond with the cat is significant, so the parent's decision could be seen as selfish in this scenario.\n"
