He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The son is 15, had the cat for 7 years, and loves it. The parent started dating someone with a severe allergy, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, called them selfish.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they're trying to balance their new relationship with their son's attachment to the cat. The partner's allergy is severe, so maybe it's a legitimate health issue. They mention the son takes care of the cat well, so rehoming wasn't because of neglect. \n\nOn the other hand, the son's feelings are hurt. Losing a pet is tough, especially when it's given away. The parent might not have considered how important the cat was to the son. Did they talk to the son before making the decision? If they didn't involve him, that could be an issue. Also, the son was upset and felt the parent prioritized the new partner over his well-being.\n\nBut the parent might have thought it's in the best interest for everyone. Maybe they tried to explain the allergy issue. The parent is also grieving the loss of their husband, which adds emotional complexity. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The parent's decision was based on the partner's health, which is valid. However, not considering the son's feelings and not discussing it with him could be where they went wrong. The son's reaction suggests he felt it was sudden and not consulted. So maybe the parent should have involved the son more, maybe found another solution like keeping the cat in a separate area or looking for a non-allergic partner first. \n\nBut the parent might not have alternatives. If the partner's allergy is severe, maybe it's unavoidable. Still, the way it was handled could be better. So the answer might be A (wrong) because the parent didn't consult their son and ignored his emotional needs. But if the parent had no choice, maybe B. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A because the son's emotional impact was significant, and the parent should have involved him in the decision.\n"
