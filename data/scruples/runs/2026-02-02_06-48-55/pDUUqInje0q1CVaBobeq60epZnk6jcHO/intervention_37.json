He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author has a 15-year-old son who's had a cat named Spacey for 7 years. The son takes care of the cat and loves him. The author is now dating someone with a severe cat allergy, making it hard for the partner to visit. The author decided to rehome the cat, which upset the son.\n\nFirst, the son's perspective is important. A 15-year-old losing a pet they've had for a long time is significant. The cat is part of his daily life, sleeping in his bed and being well-cared for. The emotional impact on the son is clear here. The son's anger suggests he feels the decision was made without his input, which could lead to resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's situation is understandable. After the death of her husband, finding a serious partner is a big deal. The allergy is severe enough that the partner can't visit often, which might affect their relationship. The author might feel that keeping the cat isn't feasible for the relationship's sake. However, the decision to give away the cat wasn't discussed with the son, which is a problem. The son is the primary caregiver, so his feelings and input should have been considered.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the sudden decision without involving the son, the son's emotional reaction, and the potential for a solution that satisfies both the son and the partner. Maybe the author could have found alternatives, like finding an allergy-friendly environment or a different solution before rehoming. Since the decision was made unilaterally and caused significant distress to the son, it might be seen as the author being in the wrong. But there's also the consideration of the partner's health. However, the main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the son's feelings. So I think the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
