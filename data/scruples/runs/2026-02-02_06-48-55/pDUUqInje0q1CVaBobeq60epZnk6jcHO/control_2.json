It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer giving away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. He cares for the cat and is upset. The parent is in a new, more serious relationship where the partner has a severe allergy. The parent decided to rehome the cat to accommodate the partner, which caused conflict with the son.\n\nFrom the parent's perspective, they might feel they're making a necessary compromise for their new relationship. The son's reaction is understandable, but the parent's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own happiness or the relationship over the son's feelings. However, the parent might argue that the allergy is significant and that the relationship is progressing, so they're trying to make it work.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's emotional attachment to the cat is strong. Giving away a pet that's been a part of his life for years could be traumatic. The parent should have considered discussing this with the son more carefully, maybe finding alternatives like keeping the cat in a separate area or getting a hypoallergenic option. The parent might also have not considered the son's perspective enough, leading to the son feeling his needs were overlooked.\n\nBut the parent is single, recently widowed, and trying to rebuild their life. The partner's allergy is severe, so maybe there's a practical aspect here. However, the son is still a minor, and the parent's decisions should balance their adult relationships with their child's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the parent acted selfishly. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong because they have their own life to consider, but they might not have handled the situation sensitively enough. Maybe a better approach would have been to find a compromise before making the decision. Since the son is 15, he's old enough to be involved in the decision-making process. The parent's action could be seen as not respecting the son's feelings enough, but they also have their own needs. It's a tough balance.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for whether the person acted thoughtlessly. Here, the parent acted without considering the son's reaction, but they had their reasons. The son's upset is valid, but the parent's decision might be seen as a reasonable choice given their circumstances. However, maybe the parent should have tried to find another solution instead of giving up the cat. So the answer could be B, they're not in the wrong, but there's nuance. Alternatively, some might say A because the child's feelings were not adequately considered. But given the parent's situation, it's a complex case. I think leaning towards B because the parent has their own life to consider, and the allergy is a valid reason, but they should have handled it better. However, since the cat was the son's, maybe the parent should have discussed it more. Hmm.\n"
