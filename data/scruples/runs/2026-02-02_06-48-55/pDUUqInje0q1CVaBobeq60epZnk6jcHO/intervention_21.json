He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's son has had a cat named Spacey for seven years. The son takes care of the cat and loves him a lot. The parent is in a new relationship, and their partner is severely allergic to cats. The parent decided to give the cat away to make things work with the new partner. The son is upset and accused the parent of being selfish.\n\nHmm. The parent's reasoning is that the relationship is getting serious, and the partner can't be over often because of the allergy. Also, the parent mentions they haven't found someone they clicked with since their husband's death, implying this relationship is important. But the son is really upset, feeling like his pet was thrown away for someone else.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, pets are family to many people, especially kids. The son had the cat for seven years, so this is a long-term commitment. The parent making a decision without the son's input might be an issue. But the parent is in a new relationship and dealing with the partner's severe allergy. The parent might feel that the relationship is important, but was there a way to find a solution that keeps both the cat and the new partner?\n\nWait, the parent could have tried to find a cat that's hypoallergenic or maybe some medical solutions for the partner's allergy instead of rehoming the cat. Also, maybe the parent didn't consider the son's emotional attachment enough. The son was taking care of the cat, so giving it away without consulting the son could be seen as dismissing his feelings. On the other hand, the parent is also dealing with their own emotional needs and trying to maintain a relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the parent considered all options and communicated with the son. If the parent acted unilaterally without trying to find a compromise, that's a problem. But if they tried everything and still had to make a tough choice, maybe it's more understandable. However, given the son's strong emotional reaction and the long history with the cat, the parent might be at fault for not involving the son in the decision. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
