It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. The situation is that the mother's partner is allergic, so she decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset and feels she's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's in a new relationship, and her partner's health is a concern. Severe allergies can be a real issue, affecting their ability to spend time together. The mother might feel that rehoming the cat is necessary for the relationship to work. But then there's the son's emotional response. The cat has been part of his life for 7 years, and he's upset that his mom prioritized the new relationship over his feelings.\n\nNow, the son is 15, so he's a teenager, which is a time when emotional bonds and personal attachments are strong. The mother taking the cat away could be seen as disregarding his feelings. But the mother might believe she's making a sacrifice for her happiness, especially after her husband's death. However, is giving away a pet that the son has cared for a fair sacrifice?\n\nThe question is if the mother is in the wrong. On one hand, she's trying to balance her new relationship with her son's needs. On the other, the son's emotional well-being is also important. Did she consult the son before making the decision? If she didn't involve him, that might be where the mistake lies. The son feeling that it was about a new \"man\" could indicate he feels betrayed or unimportant.\n\nBut the mother might not see it as selfish; she's trying to accommodate her partner's health. However, there could be alternatives, like finding a hypoallergenic replacement or ensuring the cat is kept out of certain areas. But the problem is the cat is in the son's room, so that's hard. Maybe there's a middle ground she didn't consider.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the cat was the son's, so giving it up without his input could be wrong. The mother might think it's her home, but the son's ownership and emotional attachment matter. So, the mother's actions could be seen as prioritizing her new relationship over her son's feelings without proper discussion. That would make her in the wrong. However, if there's no other option and the partner's health is a valid concern, maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the lack of communication and consultation with the son is a key point here. So, answer A (yes) seems likely because she made a decision that affects her son's emotional well-being without considering his input, even if her intentions were to manage the relationship.\n"
