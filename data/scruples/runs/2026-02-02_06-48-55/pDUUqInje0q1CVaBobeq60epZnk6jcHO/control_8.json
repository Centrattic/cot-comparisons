He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset and accuses them of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they're in a new, serious relationship, and the partner can't be around cats. The son has had the cat for seven years and takes care of it. The parent might be trying to balance their own happiness and the relationship with their son's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is 15 and might not fully understand the parent's reasoning, especially since the parent lost their spouse. The son might feel abandoned or that the parent is prioritizing the new partner over their needs. The parent didn't consult the son first, which probably added to the son's upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Giving away a pet someone cares about is a big decision. Even though the parent has a valid reason (the partner's health), not involving the son in the decision-making process might be an issue. The parent could have tried to find a solution that works for everyone, like getting the cat a separate living space, using hypoallergenic products, or considering if the relationship is worth compromising the son's well-being. \n\nHowever, the parent's actions were to manage their own relationship and health concerns of their partner. It's a tough spot, but maybe there were other options. The key here is whether the parent acted selfishly or made a reasonable decision. The son's emotional reaction suggests the parent's action had a significant impact. \n\nI think the parent might be in the wrong because they didn't involve the son in the decision. Even with a valid reason, the way they handled it could have been more considerate. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
