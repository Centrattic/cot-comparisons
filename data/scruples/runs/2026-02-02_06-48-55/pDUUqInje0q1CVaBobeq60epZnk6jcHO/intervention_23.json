He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they lost their husband and are trying to find someone new. The partner is allergic, so having the cat makes it hard for them to be together. The author might feel that rehoming the cat is necessary for the relationship. But the son has been taking care of the cat for 7 years and is really attached. He's upset, thinking the mom is being selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's reaction seems strong. He called the mom selfish and threw the cat away for someone he hasn't known long. But the mom hasn't had a partner since her husband died, so this might be a significant step for her. However, the son is 15, so maybe he's not in a position to judge his mom's actions. \n\nI need to think about the responsibilities. The author is the parent, so it's their responsibility to manage the household. But the cat was the son's, so maybe the author didn't consult him properly. The son was taking care of the cat, so giving it away without his input could be seen as overstepping. The allergy is a valid issue, but there might be alternatives, like keeping the cat in a specific room, using air filters, etc. However, the severity of the allergy might limit those options.\n\nIs the author being selfish? The son's accusation is that she's throwing away the cat for a new man. But the author is balancing her son's well-being and her own happiness. Maybe the author didn't consider the son's feelings enough. On the flip side, the son might not realize the importance of the new relationship to his mom. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at the balance of responsibility and empathy. The mom made a decision without the son's input, which is a problem. But the allergy issue is real. The son's reaction is intense, but his age might mean he's not handling it maturely. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she didn't involve her son in the decision, that's a fault. The cat was his, so she should have discussed it. However, the allergy is a valid reason. Maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but did make a mistake by not involving him. The answer might depend on whether the alternatives were considered and communicated to the son. If she didn't explore other options and just decided to rehome, that's a problem. But given the allergy's severity, maybe it's a necessary step. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because she didn't involve her son and gave away his pet, which is a big deal. But the allergy is a valid reason. Maybe answer A (yes) because she should have handled it better, but the situation is complex. Wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But I should be careful. The key points are: parent's responsibility vs. child's emotional well-being. If the parent didn't communicate, that's a problem. So the answer is A.\n"
