It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because the new partner is allergic. The son is upset, saying they're selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The cat has been with the son for 7 years, and he cares for it. The parent is dating someone with a severe allergy. The parent is single after their husband's death and feels like they haven't found someone they connect with until now. The decision to rehome the cat is causing conflict with the son.\n\nI should think about the parent's intentions. They might be trying to balance their own needs with their son's. The allergy is severe enough that the partner can't visit often, which affects their relationship. But the son is 15, so he's a teenager, which is a time when relationships with parents can be strained. The son's reaction is understandable but maybe impulsive.\n\nIs the parent being selfish? Maybe, but they might be prioritizing their new relationship over their son's emotional needs. However, the parent might feel that the new partner is important for their own emotional well-being, especially after losing their husband. The son has had the cat for a long time, so the bond is strong. The parent's decision could be seen as a tough choice between two important relationships.\n\nBut are there alternatives? Could they have found a solution that keeps the cat but accommodates the partner's allergy? Maybe the parent considered that and found it impossible. If the allergy is severe, maybe the cat's presence would cause significant health issues for the partner. That could justify the decision.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the son in the decision and finding a better way to rehome the cat (like finding a good home) might have helped the son feel more respected. The parent's lack of communication or explanation might have contributed to the son's anger.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be entirely wrong if the allergy is a real issue and they communicated properly. But if they didn't consider the son's feelings enough, maybe they are. Since the son is an adult (15 is a teenager, not an adult), but the parent might have expected some maturity there. The parent's own emotional needs after their husband's death could also be a factor.\n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're balancing their own life post-loss and a new relationship, but there's some nuance. However, if they didn't handle it with care, maybe A. But given the information, the parent's reasoning seems valid. So probably B.\n"
