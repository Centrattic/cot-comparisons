He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. The scenario is that the mother's new partner is severely allergic to cats, and she decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, feeling it was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother's perspective: she's been single after her husband's death, found someone new, and this person has a serious allergy. She can't have him over often because of the cat. She tried to rehome the cat to make the relationship work. But she's the parent, so maybe she has a duty to consider her son's feelings too.\n\nThe son's perspective: He's had the cat for seven years, clearly cares a lot for it. He feels his mother prioritized her new relationship over his emotional needs. The son is 15, so he's a teenager, which is a time when pets can be very important. The mother didn't consult him before giving the cat away, which might have been a mistake.\n\nIs the mother wrong? Well, she made a decision that affected her son without discussing it first. Even though her reasons are understandable (the allergy and wanting the relationship to work), she might have handled it differently. Maybe she could have tried to find another solution, like getting an air purifier or using medication, or involving the son in the decision-making process. By not considering her son's feelings and acting unilaterally, she might have been selfish, as the son feels. \n\nOn the other hand, she's also dealing with her own life and trying to form a new relationship after losing her husband. The allergy is severe, so maybe there's a valid reason. But the key point here is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't communicate with her son and the son's emotional well-being is also important, the action of giving away the cat without his input could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't involve her son in the decision, leading to his distress. However, others might argue B (she's not wrong) because of the allergy issue. But the question is about being in the wrong, and the main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the son's feelings, which is a parental responsibility.\n"
