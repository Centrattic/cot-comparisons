He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son is 15 and has had the cat, Spacey, for 7 years. He's attached to the cat, takes care of him, and they sleep together. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They can't have the partner over often because of the allergy, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset and called the parent selfish for doing this for a man they haven't known long. The parent mentions that since her husband's death, she hasn't found someone compatible.\n\nHmm. The main conflict here is between the parent's need to accommodate their new partner's health and the son's emotional attachment to the cat. The parent's decision was made without consulting the son, which is a problem. The son's reaction is understandable given the bond he has with the cat. Allergies are a real issue, but the parent could have explored other options first, like getting an air purifier, using antihistamines, or keeping the cat out of certain areas. Maybe the parent didn't consider those alternatives before giving the cat up. Also, the timing is an issue\u2014moving on from the loss of the husband quickly might be seen as insensitive by the son. The parent's actions might come across as prioritizing the new relationship over the son's feelings. So, the parent may have acted without considering the son's perspective and possible alternatives, which could make them at fault. But there's also the aspect of the partner's health. It's a tough situation, but the lack of communication and consideration might mean the parent is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
