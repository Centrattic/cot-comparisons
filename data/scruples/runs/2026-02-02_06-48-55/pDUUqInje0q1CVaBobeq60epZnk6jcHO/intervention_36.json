He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves the mother deciding to rehome the cat because her new partner is allergic to cats. The son is upset and feels she was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cat has been with the son for 7 years, which is a long time. The son cares for the cat well, and they have a strong bond. The mother's new partner has a severe allergy, so she can't have him over often. The mother hasn't had a serious relationship since her husband's death, so this is a big step for her. However, the son is reacting strongly, feeling that his mother is prioritizing this new relationship over his feelings.\n\nNow, thinking about the mother's perspective. She's trying to make her new relationship work, which could be important for her emotional well-being after losing her husband. Allergies can be serious, so she's making a practical decision. But she didn't consult her son first, which might be a problem. The son's reaction suggests he feels his needs were overlooked.\n\nFrom the son's side, the cat is a significant part of his life. The sudden removal without discussion could feel traumatic. Even if the mother's intention is good, the method might be flawed. The son's anger is valid because he's losing a pet he's had for years. He might feel that his mother didn't consider alternatives, like finding a new place for the cat but keeping it in the house temporarily or discussing the decision with him first.\n\nThe question is whether the mother was wrong. On one hand, she's trying to balance her new relationship and her son's needs. On the other hand, she made a decision that affects her son without his input. The severity of the allergy is a factor too\u2014if the partner can't be around the cat, the mother's hands might be tied. However, maybe there were other solutions, like using air purifiers or finding a cat-friendly environment.\n\nI think the mother's action was out of necessity due to the allergy, but she handled it poorly. She should have discussed it with her son first, given him time to adjust, and maybe found a better way to rehome the cat. So the mother is partly in the wrong because she didn't consider her son's feelings and didn't involve him in the decision-making process. But the situation is complex. The key issue is the lack of communication and the sudden decision. The son's reaction is valid, but the mother's intention is also understandable. However, in terms of fault, the mother's actions caused harm without proper consideration, so she's more in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
