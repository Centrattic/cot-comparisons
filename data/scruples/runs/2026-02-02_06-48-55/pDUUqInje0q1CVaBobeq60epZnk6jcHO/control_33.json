It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother's perspective: she's dating someone with a serious allergy, and it's affecting their relationship. She's been alone since her husband's death, so maybe she's trying to make the relationship work. Her son has had the cat for 7 years, loves it, and the cat is well-cared for. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is upset, feeling like his mom is being selfish. The mother might feel pressured to make a decision that's good for her new relationship. But taking away the cat could make her son feel neglected or as if her new partner is more important than him.\n\nI should check if there were other options. Could she have found an alternative, like finding an allergy-friendly solution for the partner? Maybe the partner could take medication or use air filters. Or maybe the cat could stay in a specific area of the house. If those options were considered and didn't work, then her choice might be more understandable. But if she didn't explore alternatives, that could make her seem selfish.\n\nAlso, the mother's well-being after her husband's death is a factor. She might be prioritizing her new relationship for emotional support. However, the son's emotional impact is significant too. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balancing both parties' needs. The mother made a tough choice, but maybe she should have involved her son more or considered alternatives first. If she didn't, then she might be at fault. But if the allergy is severe and no other solutions work, then her decision is more justified. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether there were other options. Since the post says the allergy is severe and she can't have the partner over often, maybe she had to act. However, rehoming a pet that a child has loved for years is a big decision. If she didn't try other solutions first, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. But given the info, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if there were no good alternatives. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check similar AITA cases. Usually, when a parent makes a tough decision for a relationship but it affects a child, it's considered a gray area, but sometimes the parent is in the right if it's for a valid reason. But maybe in this case, the mother should have tried to find another solution before giving up the cat. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the son should have been more understanding. I think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong), because the mother has a valid reason and the allergy is serious. However, she could have done a better job explaining and involving her son in the decision. But since she did give it away, she's not completely in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
