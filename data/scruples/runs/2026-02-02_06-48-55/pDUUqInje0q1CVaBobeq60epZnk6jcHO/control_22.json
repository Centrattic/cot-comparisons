He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat.\n\nFirst, the context: The mother's son has had the cat for 7 years, and he takes good care of it. The mother recently started dating someone with a severe allergy, so she decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, calling her selfish. The mother is grieving the loss of her husband and hasn't found someone she connects with before.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, the cat belongs to the son, right? If she gave it away without his consent, that's a problem. Even though the mother has a reason (her partner's allergy), taking away a pet that the child has had for years without consulting them might be seen as overstepping. The son is 15, which is an age where they can form strong attachments and have opinions about their belongings. The mother's decision could be seen as prioritizing her own relationship over her son's feelings. However, the mother is also dealing with her own grief and trying to make a compromise for her new relationship. \n\nBut the key issue here is consent and communication. If the mother didn't talk to her son first, that's a mistake. Even if she thought it was for a good reason, the process of how she handled it might be at fault. The son's emotional reaction suggests he felt betrayed. On the other hand, the mother might believe she's acting in the best interest of her relationship and maybe the cat's health due to the allergy. But since the son is the one who owns the cat, the mother should have involved him in the decision. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, she's at fault) because she didn't consult her son before giving away his pet. Even with good intentions, not respecting his ownership and emotional bond could be wrong.\n"
