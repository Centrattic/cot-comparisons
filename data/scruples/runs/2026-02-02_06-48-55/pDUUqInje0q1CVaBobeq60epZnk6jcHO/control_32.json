It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves a parent who recently started dating someone with a severe cat allergy and decided to rehome the cat to make their relationship work. The son is upset, feeling that his parent is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're trying to manage a new relationship where allergies are a significant issue. Allergies can be serious, affecting daily life and health. The parent has been single since the husband's death, so this new relationship is important to them. They want to make it work but can't have the cat around. \n\nOn the other hand, the son has had the cat for seven years and is very attached. The parent acknowledges the son's feelings but made the decision to give the cat away. The son feels it's selfish, prioritizing the new partner over his long-term pet. \n\nI should think about the responsibilities here. The parent is the guardian, so they have a duty to consider both their son's well-being and their own happiness. But there's also the son's maturity level\u201415 years old. At that age, a pet can be a big part of their life, but they might not fully understand the parent's need to consider their new partner's health.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, they tried to find a solution that balances their needs and their son's. However, giving away a pet is a big decision. Did they explore alternatives? Like getting an allergy test for the partner, using air purifiers, or maybe finding a cat-friendly accommodation? If they considered all options and found them inadequate, then maybe their decision is justified. But if there were other solutions, the parent might be at fault for not trying harder. \n\nThe parent mentions the allergy is severe, not just a mild reaction. That makes the situation more complex. If the partner can't be around the cat without serious symptoms, it's a legitimate health issue. However, the son's emotional well-being is also important. The parent might have made a tough call, but communication with the son is key. Was there a discussion about this decision beforehand? If the son felt blindsided, that could add to his upset.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent made a difficult decision considering their own happiness and health of the partner, but they might have mishandled the communication with the son. Whether they're in the wrong depends on if they exhausted all alternatives and involved the son in the decision-making process. Since the story doesn't mention alternatives tried, but the allergy is severe, the parent might be justified. So answer B, No.\n"
