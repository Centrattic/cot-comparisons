He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away her son's cat. The son is 15, has had the cat for 7 years, and really loves it. The mother started dating someone with a severe cat allergy. She decided to rehome the cat, which upset her son who said she was selfish. The mother is asking if she did the right thing.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the mother's responsibility towards her son and the new partner's health. The son is a teenager, so he's at an age where attachments are strong. The cat has been a part of his life for seven years. The mother's decision affects both her son's emotional well-being and her new partner's health. \n\nOn one hand, the mother is trying to make things work with a new partner who can't be around cats. Allergies can be serious, so she might feel it's necessary for their relationship. But on the other hand, the son is upset and feels betrayed. The mother didn't consult the son, which could be a mistake. Maybe she could have discussed options like finding an alternative living arrangement for the cat, like a different room or a friend's house, instead of rehoming.\n\nBut was she in the wrong? It's a tough situation. She's balancing two important aspects: her son's emotional needs and the health of her new partner. However, the son's reaction suggests that the decision was made without his input, leading him to feel his needs were disregarded. The mother might have handled it better by involving the son in the decision, maybe finding a compromise that allows Spacey to stay but also accommodates the partner's allergy. \n\nSo, maybe the mother is in the wrong not because she gave away the cat, but because she didn't involve her son in the decision-making process. The situation is complex, but the lack of communication and consideration for her son's feelings might make her at fault. Alternatively, some might argue that her partner's health is a valid reason, but that's not the case here. The key issue is the process and the son's perspective being overlooked.\n"
