He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because the new partner is allergic.\n\nFirst, the son has had the cat for 7 years and takes care of it. The mom is dating someone with a severe allergy. She can't have the partner over often, so she rehomed the cat. The son is upset, calling her selfish. The mom is single since her husband's death and hasn't been with anyone else. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the cat is the son's, and removing it without his input might be seen as not respecting his feelings. But on the other hand, the mother's right to make decisions about her household, especially considering her relationship. Allergies can be serious, and if the partner can't visit often, that's a real issue. \n\nBut maybe there were alternatives? Like finding an allergy-friendly partner or getting the cat treated. However, the mother tried to find a solution. The son might feel betrayed, but the mom had to balance her son's needs with her own happiness. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about intentions and alternatives. Did she consider the son's feelings? She might have thought it was for the best. But did she involve him? Maybe not enough. However, she's also dealing with grief and trying to move on. \n\nI think the key points are: the cat was the son's, but the mother's decision was for a valid reason. The son's upset is justified, but the mother's action might not be entirely wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a better angle. Maybe she should have discussed more with the son first. However, given the context, the allergy is a real issue. So, probably B.\n"
