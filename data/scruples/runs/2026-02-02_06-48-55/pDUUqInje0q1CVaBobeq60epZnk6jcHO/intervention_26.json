It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son loved the cat, had him for 7 years, and took care of him. The mother started dating someone with a severe allergy, so she decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset, called her selfish, and now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's a single parent since her husband died. She's trying to maintain a relationship with someone who can't be around cats. Allergies can be serious, and if it's severe, it might affect their living together or the partner's health. She might feel that rehoming the cat is necessary for the relationship to work.\n\nOn the other hand, the son has had the cat for a long time, and the cat is part of his life. Taking the cat away could be traumatic for him. The son accused the mother of being selfish, which suggests he feels her needs are being prioritized over his. The mother might not have considered the emotional impact on her son, or maybe she didn't have a say in the decision.\n\nThe mother might say she tried to find a good home for the cat, but the son is still upset. The question is whether her actions were justified given her situation. Allergies can prevent people from living in the same house, so maybe the mother had to make a tough choice. But was there an alternative? Could they have found a hypoallergenic environment? Maybe not if the partner's allergy is severe.\n\nAlso, the mother's emotional state is a factor. She's been through the loss of her husband and is trying to form a new relationship. She might feel isolated and that this is her chance to find someone. But she also has a responsibility to her son's well-being.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the allergy, the impact on the son, and whether the mother gave the son a chance to adjust or find another solution. If the mother didn't consult the son or didn't consider his feelings, that might be where she's in the wrong. However, if the allergy is truly a deal-breaker and the son is an adult (15 is a teenager, but still a child in need of parental guidance), the mother might have done what she thought was best for her own happiness and the relationship's health.\n\nBut the son's emotional reaction is significant. Teenagers can be very attached to their pets. The mother's decision might not account for the long-term emotional effects on her son. Maybe there's a middle ground, like keeping the cat in a separate part of the house or using air filters, but if the allergy is severe, that might not help.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother has a duty to protect her son's interests as a parent. If the cat was being well-cared for, maybe rehoming isn't the only option. Alternatively, the mother might feel that her happiness is important too, especially after her husband's death and being alone for so long.\n\nSo, there's a balance between her needs and her son's needs. If the mother acted unilaterally without considering her son's feelings, she's in the wrong. But if she had to make a hard decision for a valid reason, maybe she's not. The answer here depends on whether the allergy is a critical factor and if there were alternatives. The son is 15, so it's not like he's independent yet; his mother's decision affects him more significantly.\n\nI think the mother is in the wrong because she didn't involve the son in the decision and didn't consider his emotional attachment. However, if the allergy is a genuine and severe issue, maybe there's some understanding needed. But overall, the mother should have communicated better with her son and perhaps found another solution together.\n"
