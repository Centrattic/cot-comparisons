He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son is 15, had the cat for 7 years, and the mom is dating someone allergic to cats. The partner's allergy is severe enough that the mom can't have him over often. She decided to rehome the cat, which made the son upset. The son accused her of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different angles here. The mom's perspective: she's trying to make her new relationship work, and the cat is a significant obstacle. The partner's allergy is severe, not just a mild one. Since her husband passed away, she hasn't been with anyone else, so this might be a meaningful relationship for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the son has had the cat for a long time, and the cat is a part of his life. The mom took over the decision without consulting him, which caused emotional distress. The son feels his feelings weren't considered, and he's upset that the mom prioritized her new partner over his well-being. \n\nNow, is the mom in the wrong? Well, she did take a major step that affected her son's emotional life without involving him. While her intentions might be to manage her relationship, the way she handled it could be seen as dismissive of her son's feelings. Maybe she could have tried to find a solution that allowed the cat to stay but also accommodated her partner, like finding a cat-friendly medication or using air purifiers. \n\nHowever, the partner's allergy is severe, and maybe those solutions aren't viable. The mom might have felt she had no other choice. But the key point is communication. If she had discussed it with her son and involved him in the decision, even if the outcome was the same, the process would be more respectful. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the mom isn't entirely in the wrong because she's navigating a tough situation between her son and her new relationship. But she could have handled it better by considering her son's feelings more and exploring alternatives. The question is whether the action itself is wrong. Since the cat is the son's, giving it away without his input is problematic. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider her son's feelings and made a unilateral decision. But others might argue it's a difficult situation where she had to make a choice. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But the main issue is the lack of communication and the son's emotional well-being. So perhaps the answer is A.\n"
