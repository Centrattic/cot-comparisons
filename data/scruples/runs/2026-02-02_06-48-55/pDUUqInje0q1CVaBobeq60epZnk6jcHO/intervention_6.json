He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves a 15-year-old son who's upset because his cat, Spacey, has been rehomed. The mother is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. She felt she had to make the decision because the relationship was getting more serious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The son clearly loves the cat and has had it for seven years, taking care of it. The mother's reasoning is about her new partner's health. But maybe she didn't involve the son enough in the decision. Did she try other options first? Like maybe finding a different arrangement where the cat could stay but not affect the partner? The son feels betrayed, which is a strong emotional reaction. The mother might not have considered the impact on her son emotionally. \n\nIs the allergy a valid reason? It's severe, so it's not trivial. But the mother could have explored alternatives\u2014maybe the partner could have taken precautions, or the cat could have been kept in a different part of the house. However, if the allergy is that bad, maybe those measures aren't enough. Still, the sudden decision without involving the son seems hasty. The son might feel his attachment wasn't respected. \n\nAlso, the mother mentions her late husband, which adds emotional context. She might be trying to move on, but the son is still grieving? Or maybe the son's anger is about losing his pet. It's possible the mother didn't communicate her reasoning clearly to the son, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother had a valid concern for her partner's health, but the way she handled it without considering her son's feelings could be the issue. The son's care for the cat is important too. So maybe the mother is partly in the wrong for not discussing alternatives or involving her son in the decision-making process. The answer might be A, but I'm not sure. Wait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to check if the alternatives were considered. If she tried everything else and the only option was to rehome, maybe it's not her fault. But if she didn't give her son a say, then perhaps she is. So the key here is whether she acted without considering her son's perspective. Since the son is 15, he's old enough to have a say. So the mother might be in the wrong for not consulting him first. Answer A.\n"
