He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, thinking the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. The new partner has a severe allergy, and the author and partner are getting serious. That's a valid concern because severe allergies can be a big deal for health. The author might not want to compromise the partner's well-being.\n\nBut then there's the son's perspective. The cat has been with him for seven years, and he took care of it. The son feels it was thrown away for a new relationship. The author mentions that her husband died, and she's been alone, so maybe she's trying to move on.\n\nIs there an alternative solution? Maybe the author could have found another way to handle the situation, like getting a hypoallergenic cat or using air purifiers, but she chose to rehome the current one. But if the allergy is severe, those solutions might not be effective enough.\n\nThe key here is balancing the son's emotional attachment and the partner's health. The author might not be in the wrong because she's prioritizing the partner's health and the future of the relationship. However, she might have failed to involve the son in the decision, leading to his feeling of betrayal.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she's the parent, so she has the right to make decisions about pets. Emotionally, maybe she should have considered the son's feelings more. However, given the circumstances, her actions are understandable. So probably, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
