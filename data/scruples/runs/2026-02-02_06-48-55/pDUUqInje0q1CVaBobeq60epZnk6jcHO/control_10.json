He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent gave away their son's cat because the new partner is allergic. The son is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They wanted to make their new relationship work and the partner has a severe allergy. The parent had been alone since their husband's death, so maybe they felt this was a good chance for a new relationship. But the son has had the cat for 7 years and was taking care of it. The parent decided to rehome the cat without the son's input, which made the son feel like the parent was being selfish.\n\nI should think about the responsibilities here. As a parent, they need to balance their own needs with their child's well-being. The son is 15, so he's a teenager, and losing a pet he's attached to is significant. Did the parent communicate with the son before making the decision? The post says the son yelled at them, so maybe there was a lack of discussion. However, the parent might have felt that the allergy is a serious issue affecting their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's feelings are valid. The cat was his, and he was taking care of it. The parent's decision might have been made without considering the son's emotional attachment. But the parent might not have seen another way to resolve the conflict between the son's needs and their own new relationship.\n\nAlso, the severity of the allergy is a factor. If the partner can't be around the cat, it's a real problem. But was there an alternative, like finding a hypoallergenic cat or getting treatment for the allergy? The post doesn't mention other options considered.\n\nI think the parent's mistake was not discussing the decision with the son and not considering alternatives. They might have acted unilaterally, causing emotional harm. However, their intention was to manage their relationship. The son's reaction is understandable given the bond he has with the cat.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call, but probably not entirely. They made a decision based on their circumstances, but the way they handled it without involving the son might be where they went wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance here.\n"
