He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The scenario is that the son has had the cat for seven years, loves it, and takes care of it. The author starts dating someone allergic to cats, and since the relationship is getting serious, they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset and called the author selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, and the son is 15. The cat was the son's pet, so the son had a strong emotional attachment. The parent's decision to give away the cat might be seen as overstepping, especially since the son was the primary caregiver. But the parent has a valid reason: their partner's severe allergy. They have to think about their current relationship's well-being and future.\n\nBut here's the conflict: the son is a teenager, and his emotional response is intense. He feels like the parent is prioritizing a new relationship over his long-time pet. The parent mentions that since the husband's death, they haven't met someone they clicked with. This suggests they might feel isolated and are trying to make this relationship work. However, the decision was made without consulting the son, which is a problem. The parent might have thought it was for the best, but not involving the son in the decision could have caused the upset.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? On one hand, they're considering their partner's health. On the other, they didn't consider their son's feelings and took away something he deeply cares about. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely because the allergy is a real issue, but maybe they should have found another solution, like getting an air purifier or moving the cat to another family member's house. Also, the son is old enough to understand and maybe involved in the decision-making. Without consulting him, the action could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nI think the answer would be A (Yes) because even though the reason is valid, the parent didn't involve the son, leading to emotional harm. However, others might argue B (No) because the parent is managing their own relationship and health considerations. But in most cases like this, where a child's emotional well-being is affected without their input, the parent is often seen as at fault. So leaning towards A.\n"
