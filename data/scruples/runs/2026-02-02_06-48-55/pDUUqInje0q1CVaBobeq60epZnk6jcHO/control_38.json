He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because the new partner is allergic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son is 15 and has had the cat for 7 years. He's upset, even yelling that the parent was selfish. The parent is dating someone with a severe allergy, which is affecting their ability to have the partner over. The parent feels they didn't know what else to do after their husband's death.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that they want to maintain the relationship with their partner, who has a serious allergy. But the son is really attached to the cat. The parent's action might be seen as prioritizing their own relationship over the son's feelings. But at the same time, the parent might feel they're trying to balance their own happiness and the relationship with their partner.\n\nI should think about the responsibilities here. Parents have a duty to consider their children's well-being, but they also have their own lives and needs. However, the child is still a minor, so the parent might have more authority in decision-making. But if the son is taking care of the cat, maybe the cat was his responsibility and a significant part of his life. \n\nThe severity of the allergy matters. If the partner can't be around the cat often, that's a real issue. The parent might not want to compromise their new relationship. But was there any alternative considered? For example, could the cat have been rehomed to another family member or a friend? Maybe a different arrangement could have been made. \n\nThe parent's emotional state is also a factor. After the death of their husband, finding a new partner might be important for their well-being. But the son's emotional reaction is also valid. The parent didn't consult the son, which might make the decision seem abrupt. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a tough situation. The parent made a decision based on their circumstances, but without considering the son's feelings. The son feels betrayed, which is a big emotional impact. On the other hand, the parent's intentions are to manage their own life and relationship. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the parent considered alternatives and communicated with the son. If the parent acted unilaterally without discussing it, that could be problematic. But the parent might have felt they had no choice. However, the son's perspective is important, so the parent might be in the wrong for not involving him in the decision.\n"
