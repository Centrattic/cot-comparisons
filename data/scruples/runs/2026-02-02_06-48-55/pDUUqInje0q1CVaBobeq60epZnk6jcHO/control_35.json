He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old son who's been taking care of his cat, Spacey, for 7 years. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They decided to rehome the cat to make things work with the partner. The son is upset, feeling it was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're in a new relationship after their husband's death, and the partner's health is a concern. Allergies can be serious, especially if it's more than just sniffles. The parent might feel that maintaining the relationship is important, and maybe they think the son can adjust over time.\n\nOn the other hand, the son has had the cat for years and is now upset, feeling betrayed. The parent's decision might not have considered the son's emotional attachment and how important Spacey is to him. The son is at an age where pets are often seen as family members, so losing Spacey could be traumatic.\n\nI should also consider the parent's responsibility. They might have thought they were acting in the best interest of their relationship, but maybe they didn't involve the son in the decision or explore alternatives like finding a cat-friendly partner or getting treatment for allergies. However, given the severity of the allergy, maybe there's no feasible alternative.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's a tough call. The parent might not be in the wrong because managing a partner's health is important, but they could have handled it better by involving the son or finding another solution before giving up the cat. The son's feelings are valid, though. The parent's actions might be seen as prioritizing their relationship over their child's emotional well-being. But since the parent is also dealing with grief and a new relationship, maybe their decision is understandable.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of the son's emotional bond with the cat versus the parent's need to maintain a healthy relationship. Since the parent didn't consider the son's feelings as much as they could have, maybe they are partly at fault. But allergies are legitimate, so it's not entirely their fault. The answer might be that they're not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they handled the situation.\n"
