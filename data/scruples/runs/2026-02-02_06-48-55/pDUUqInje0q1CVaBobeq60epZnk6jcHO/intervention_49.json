He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves a 15-year-old son who's had the cat for seven years and is very attached to it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy, making it hard for the partner to visit. The parent decides to rehome the cat, which upsets the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they're in a new relationship, and the partner's health is a concern. The son's perspective: losing a pet he's cared for and loved for years. The parent feels they have a right to pursue a relationship, but the son feels betrayed.\n\nI should think about the parent's responsibility. The cat is the son's pet, so the decision to rehome it should involve the son. The parent might not have consulted the son, leading to the son feeling his wishes were ignored. But the parent also has to balance their own happiness and health concerns, especially since the partner's allergy is severe.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe finding an alternative solution, like keeping the cat in a separate area or using air purifiers. If those options were considered and didn't work, maybe giving the cat away is necessary. But if the parent didn't explore all options and just gave the cat away without the son's input, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe son's reaction is understandable\u2014he's a teenager, and losing a long-time companion is tough. The parent might have acted out of a desire to make the relationship work, but without considering the son's feelings. So, the parent might be in the wrong for not involving the son in the decision or not finding a compromise that respects both the son's and partner's needs.\n"
