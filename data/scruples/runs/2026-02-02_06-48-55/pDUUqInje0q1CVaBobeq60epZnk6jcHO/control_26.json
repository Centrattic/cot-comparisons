It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a parent whose son has a cat named Spacey. The cat has been with the son for seven years, and the son cares for it well. Now, the author is dating someone who's severely allergic to cats. They've been dating for a few months and are getting more serious. The author decided to rehome the cat, which upset the son. The son yelled, called the author selfish, and said they were throwing the cat away for a new partner. The author mentions that after the husband's death, this new partner is someone they've connected with.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A or B. Let me think about the factors here.\n\nFirst, the son's cat: it's his cat, so giving it away might infringe on the son's rights. The son has had it for seven years and obviously cares for it. The author's decision affects the son significantly. On the other hand, the author is in a new relationship where the partner has a severe allergy. They can't have the partner over often because of this. The author is trying to balance their own needs with their son's. The author also mentions they haven't met someone they clicked with since their husband died, so maybe this is a big step for them.\n\nBut the key points here are: Did the author consult the son before rehoming the cat? The story says the author decided to rehome the cat, but if the son is the legal owner and the cat has been in his care, giving it away without his consent might be an issue. Even if the author is the parent, the son is 15, which is teenagers, but still, the parent should consider the child's feelings and perhaps make a joint decision.\n\nHowever, the parent is also trying to manage their own life, including a new relationship. The allergy is severe, so maybe the parent felt that keeping the cat would hinder the relationship's progress. But maybe there are alternatives, like finding a hypoallergenic solution, or getting the cat tested for allergen levels, or maybe the partner could take precautions. But the story says it's a severe allergy, so maybe those options aren't viable.\n\nAnother angle: The son is upset because he feels his parent is prioritizing a new partner over his well-being. The parent might feel that this new relationship is important after being alone since the husband's death. The parent's decision could be seen as necessary for their own happiness, but the son's emotional reaction is valid too.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent is the caregiver and has the authority to make decisions about pets, but when a pet is deeply connected to a child, the parent should involve the child in the decision. If the parent went ahead without discussing it, that's a problem. The parent should have considered alternatives, maybe tried to find a solution that satisfies both the son's and their own needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult the son before rehoming his cat, and the decision had a significant emotional impact on him. The parent's decision was made without considering the son's feelings and ownership of the cat. However, the parent's own needs and new relationship are also a factor. But given the son's long-term care of the cat and the lack of consultation, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author.\n"
