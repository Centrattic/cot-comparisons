It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic to cats. The son is upset, calling the mother selfish and throwing away the cat for someone she hasn't known long. The mother is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cat, Spacey, has been with the son for seven years, and he cares for it well. The mother's new partner has a severe allergy, making it hard for him to visit. The mother decided to rehome the cat, which caused the son to react negatively. The mother is single since her husband's death and hasn't found someone she's compatible with before.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The mother's decision was based on her new relationship's needs. But the son is still a child under 18, so his well-being is a priority. The cat is part of his life, so taking that away could impact him emotionally. The mother might not have considered the son's feelings enough or involved him in the decision. On the other hand, her partner's health is important, but maybe there are alternatives like getting an allergy medication, using air purifiers, or finding a cat-friendly allergy treatment. The decision to give up the cat might have been rushed without exploring other options. The son's reaction suggests he felt his bond with the cat was disregarded. However, the mother's intention wasn't malicious; she was trying to balance her personal life and her partner's health. It's a tough situation, but the key issue is whether she considered the son's perspective and alternatives before acting. If she didn't involve her son or consider other solutions, she might be in the wrong. However, if she genuinely tried alternatives and still decided to rehome, it's a different story. The question is whether her actions were selfish or a necessary compromise. The answer hinges on whether she acted without due consideration for her son's feelings and the cat's welfare.\n"
