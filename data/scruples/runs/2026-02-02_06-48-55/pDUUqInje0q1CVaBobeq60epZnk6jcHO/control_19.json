He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, feeling it's selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they've lost their husband, found someone new, but the allergy is a problem. Keeping the cat would mean the partner can't visit much, which could affect the relationship. The parent might feel they have a right to pursue happiness. \n\nOn the other hand, the son has had the cat for 7 years, loves it, and feels betrayed. The parent made a decision without consulting the son, which can be seen as not respecting his feelings. The son's argument is that the parent is prioritizing a new relationship over their child's well-being.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The key points here are: Was there communication? The parent didn't consult the son, which is a problem. The son's emotional attachment is significant. However, the parent's situation is also valid\u2014long-term relationships need to consider such factors. \n\nBut did the parent have to give up the cat immediately? Maybe they could have tried alternatives, like finding an allergy-friendly solution, or discussing it with the partner. However, severe allergies can't always be ignored. \n\nThe parent's lack of communication is a major issue. Deciding unilaterally to rehome the cat, especially without involving the son, might be seen as selfish. The son's reaction is understandable. So, the parent might be in the wrong here for not discussing it with the son first and not considering the emotional impact. \n\nBut I should also consider that the parent is trying to balance their own needs with their son's. However, the son is now a teenager, old enough to be involved in such a decision. The parent should have talked it over, perhaps found a compromise. \n\nIn the end, the parent's actions, while understandable, may have been hasty and self-centered. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the parent didn't consider the son's feelings enough and made the decision without proper discussion.\n"
