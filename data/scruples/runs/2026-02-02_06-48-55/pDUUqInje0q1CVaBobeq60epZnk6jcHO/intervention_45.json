He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son is 15 and has had the cat for 7 years. He loves the cat a lot. The parent started dating someone with a severe allergy, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son got upset and accused the parent of being selfish.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's responsibility. The son is a minor, so the parent is the guardian. The cat is the son's pet, but the parent has the final say. However, the child was taking care of the cat for years, so the parent's decision might affect the son's sense of ownership and responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is in a new relationship where allergies are a real problem. If the partner can't visit often because of the allergy, it's a valid concern for the parent's current happiness and the relationship's future. The parent might be balancing their son's feelings with their own needs and the new partner's health.\n\nBut did the parent consult the son? The post doesn't mention that. If the parent made the decision without discussing, that's a problem. The son was upset because he felt it was thrown away for a new partner. The parent's reasoning is that since the husband died, they haven't found someone they clicked with, implying they value this new relationship.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, the parent has the right to make such decisions. On the other, not involving the son in the decision might have caused emotional harm. The parent might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it better by communicating. However, given the circumstances, maybe the parent's action is justified. So, answer B (not in the wrong) because it's a parent's decision, but the handling could be better.\n"
