He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving away a son's cat because the new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, feeling it's selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a parent who took action to rehome the cat due to her partner's severe allergy. The son has had the cat for seven years and is very attached. The author's reasoning is that the relationship is becoming serious, and she can't have her partner over often because of the allergy. The son yells at her, calling her selfish. The author is reflecting on her decision, wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. On one hand, the parent is trying to balance her son's well-being with her new relationship. Severe allergies can be a genuine health issue, so she's making a difficult choice. On the other hand, the son has a strong emotional bond with the cat, and the decision was made without his input, leading to his distress. The parent might not have considered other alternatives, like finding an allergy-friendly environment or giving the cat to a family member. \n\nBut the parent's intention isn't malicious. She's dealing with the loss of her husband and trying to move forward. However, the way she handled it could be seen as not respecting her son's feelings. Maybe she should have involved him in the decision-making process or explored other options first. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a tough call. The parent's action is driven by her own needs and circumstances, but the impact on her son is significant. The answer might depend on whether there were other viable solutions. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and the son is upset, maybe the parent's decision, while understandable, is still the wrong action because it disregards the son's emotional needs without trying alternatives. So, A: Yes, she's in the wrong. Alternatively, if her action is seen as necessary for her own well-being and the relationship, then B: No. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not about sympathy. The parent's decision to take the cat without the son's consent might be the issue. So, considering that, the answer is A.\n"
