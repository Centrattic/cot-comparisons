He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for giving away their son's cat. The key points here are the son's emotional attachment to the cat, the mother's decision based on her new partner's severe allergy, and the son's reaction.\n\nFirst, the son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. He clearly loves the cat a lot, taking care of it and having it sleep with him. The mother's new partner has a severe allergy, which is a legitimate health issue. The mother feels that rehoming the cat is necessary for their relationship to move forward. However, the son is upset, feeling that his mother is being selfish and prioritizing her new relationship over his well-being.\n\nThe mother's motivation is a bit complex. She mentions that after her husband's death, she hasn't met someone she clicks with. This might add emotional pressure to make the new relationship work. However, the main issue is whether giving away the cat was the right decision. \n\nFrom the son's perspective, losing a pet that's been a part of his life for so long can be traumatic. He might feel that his mother didn't consider his feelings enough. The mother, on the other hand, is trying to balance her own happiness and health with her son's needs. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, the decision to give away a pet is significant. While the allergy is a valid concern, was there any alternative considered? For example, could the son have been willing to move out temporarily, or could the family have found an allergist or other solutions? If the mother didn't explore those options and made the decision unilaterally, that could be seen as selfish. However, if there were no viable alternatives and the allergy is severe enough to affect their relationship, then maybe it's a necessary but painful choice.\n\nThe son's reaction is strong\u2014yelling and calling her selfish. That suggests a lack of communication and understanding. The mother might have failed to involve her son in the decision-making process, which is crucial here. The emotional impact on the son is significant, and the mother's action might not have considered his emotional well-being enough.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, the mother has to balance her son's needs with her own. But pets are part of the family, and removing a long-term pet without the owner's consent (the son, in this case) can be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the mother is the pet's legal owner, the emotional ownership is with the son. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mother's actions might be seen as prioritizing her own happiness and the new relationship over her son's emotional health. Therefore, she could be in the wrong. But there's nuance here. The severity of the allergy and the lack of alternatives might mitigate some of the responsibility. However, the approach taken\u2014sudden decision without much discussion\u2014plays a role. The answer might lean towards yes, she is in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
