It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic to cats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The son is 15 years old and has had the cat, Spacey, for 7 years. He cares for the cat and is very upset about the decision. The parent is in a new, more serious relationship, and the partner has a severe allergy. The parent feels they don't have a choice but to rehome the cat because they can't have the partner over often. The son is angry, calling the parent selfish.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to balance their son's emotional attachment to the cat with their own need to have a relationship. The parent is a single parent since the husband's death. They haven't felt a connection with anyone else since then, so this partner is significant to them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the son has a long-term bond with the cat, and losing it is a big emotional hit. On the other hand, the parent's new relationship is important, and the allergy is severe. The parent might not be able to maintain the relationship if the cat is around. \n\nBut maybe the parent should have discussed this more with the son before making the decision. The son is 15, which is an age where they can understand complex situations but might still be very attached. Was there a way to find a middle ground? For example, maybe the cat could be moved to another part of the house, or the parent could explore if the partner's allergy can be managed somehow. However, the parent says the allergy is severe, so that might not be feasible.\n\nThe parent's intention was to make the relationship work, which is understandable, especially after being alone since their husband's death. But did they consider the son's feelings enough? The son is upset and feels betrayed. The parent might not have handled the communication well, which could have led to the son feeling like his needs were disregarded.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The parent acted out of their own needs and circumstances, but they might have overlooked the son's emotional impact. So, the parent might share some responsibility. However, the situation is complicated, and there's no perfect solution here. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer might depend on whether the parent made a decision without consulting the son adequately.\n"
