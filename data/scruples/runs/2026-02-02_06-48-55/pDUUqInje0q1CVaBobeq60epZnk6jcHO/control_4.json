He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, saying the mother was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's dating someone with a severe cat allergy, which complicates their relationship. She might think that rehoming the cat is necessary for the relationship to work. But on the other hand, the cat has been with the son for 7 years, and he's very attached. The son feels like the mother is prioritizing the new partner over him.\n\nThe mother also mentions that her husband passed away, and she hasn't found someone she connected with before. Maybe she feels like this relationship is important. However, making a decision without the son's input might have been a mistake. The son is 15, which is a teenager, so while he's not an adult, his feelings and attachment to the cat are significant.\n\nIs the mother being selfish? If she made the decision without considering her son's feelings, that could be seen as selfish. But if she tried to find a solution that works for everyone, maybe not. The key here is whether she communicated with her son and considered his feelings. If she didn't involve him, then it's her fault. If she did and he still resisted, maybe she had to make a tough choice.\n\nAlso, the allergy is serious, so it's a valid concern. The mother might feel that the relationship is worth pursuing, but she needs to balance her son's emotional needs. Rehoming a pet is a big decision, especially when it's the child's pet. The mother should have involved her son in the decision-making process. Maybe they could have found another solution, like keeping the cat in a separate area or getting an air purifier. If she didn't explore those options, that might be part of the problem.\n\nIn summary, the mother's intentions might be understandable, but the way she handled it\u2014without involving her son\u2014could be where she went wrong. So, the answer might be A, that she is in the wrong because she didn't consider her son's feelings and made a unilateral decision.\n"
