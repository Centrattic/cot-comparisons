He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The son is 15, has had the cat for 7 years, and takes care of it well. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son got upset and accused the parent of being selfish.\n\nHmm, the parent's perspective: After the husband's death, they haven't found someone compatible. Now this new partner has a serious allergy, making visits difficult. So they made a tough choice to rehome the cat to save the relationship. But the son is really hurt, feeling like the cat was thrown away for a new man. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to balance their own happiness and the new relationship with their child's feelings. On the other, the cat was their son's pet, so giving it away without considering his feelings might be seen as selfish. The parent might not have consulted the son first, which could be a misstep. However, the parent's situation is also complex, dealing with loss and trying to form a new serious relationship. \n\nBut the son's reaction is understandable. The cat was part of his life for years. The parent didn't mention if they tried to find a solution that could satisfy both the allergy and the son's attachment. Maybe a different arrangement, like a cat-free room or professional cleaning? Or perhaps the parent could have involved the son in the decision to make him feel included. \n\nThe severity of the allergy is a factor. If it's truly severe, the parent might be prioritizing health. But the son's emotional well-being is also important. The parent might not be in the wrong if they made a difficult choice for their own health and relationship, but the way they handled it without involving the son could be the issue. So maybe the parent's intention isn't wrong, but the method is. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because they didn't consider the son's feelings and took away something he loved without discussion. But I'm not sure. I need to decide between A and B. The key points are the son's long-term care of the cat, the parent's possible lack of communication, and the impact on the son. So the parent might be in the wrong for not involving the son in the decision. So answer A.\n"
