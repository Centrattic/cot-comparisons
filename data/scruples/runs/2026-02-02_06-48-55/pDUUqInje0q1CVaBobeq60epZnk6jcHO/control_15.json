It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The son is 15 and has had the cat for 7 years. He takes good care of the cat, and they're close. The parent started dating someone with a severe cat allergy. The partner isn't deathly ill, but it's serious enough that the parent can't have them over often. The parent decided to rehome the cat, which led to a conflict with the son.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: They're in a new relationship, the partner's allergy is a significant issue. The parent might be trying to balance their son's happiness and their new relationship. After the husband's death, finding someone they connect with is important, but the son is upset and feels betrayed.\n\nFrom the son's side, losing a pet that's been a part of his life for so long is traumatic. He might feel his parent is prioritizing a new partner over his well-being. The son's reaction is understandable given his emotional attachment.\n\nThe parent's decision isn't just about the partner's allergy but also about moving forward after their husband's death. However, they didn't consult the son about rehoming the cat, which could be seen as a lack of respect for his feelings.\n\nI should consider if there were alternatives. Maybe the parent could have tried to find a solution that works for everyone, like setting up a cat-free zone in the house, using air purifiers, or discussing the situation with the son before making the decision. The parent's decision might seem quick and without enough discussion, which could place the blame on them. But the partner's allergy is a real issue too. It's a tough balance between two important relationships.\n\nHowever, the son's well-being is crucial. The parent might have acted out of a desire to make their new relationship work but didn't consider the emotional impact on their child. That's a point in favor of the parent being in the wrong. But the parent also has the right to their own happiness after losing their spouse. \n\nIn these situations, communication is key. If the parent had talked to the son and maybe found a compromise, like getting a new cat for the son, it might have been better. But the parent didn't involve the son, leading to the son feeling his needs were ignored. That's a significant factor here.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's decision was hasty and didn't involve the son, leading to emotional harm. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A), but there are mitigating circumstances. Still, the lack of communication and consideration for the son's feelings is a strong point against them.\n"
