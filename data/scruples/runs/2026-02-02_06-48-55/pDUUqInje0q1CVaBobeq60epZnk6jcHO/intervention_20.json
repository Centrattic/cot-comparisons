He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son, who's 15, has had the cat for 7 years and takes care of it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset and accused the parent of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're in a new relationship, and the partner's health is a concern. Allergies can be serious, so the parent might feel this is necessary for the relationship to work. But the son is 15, so he's a teenager, and the cat has been part of his life for a long time. The parent might not have considered the emotional impact on the son, which could be a factor.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is also dealing with grief after the husband's death and hasn't found someone they clicked with until now. That adds another layer\u2014maybe they're trying to make this new relationship work. But was the decision made without the son's consent? The parent decided to rehome the cat without consulting the son, which could be seen as not respecting the son's feelings and ownership.\n\nThe son called the parent selfish, which suggests he feels his needs were overlooked. The parent's responsibility is to balance the son's well-being with their own adult relationships. However, a 15-year-old is still a minor, so the parent has the legal right to make decisions, but that doesn't mean the emotional aspect isn't important. The parent should have tried to find a solution that considers both the son's and the partner's needs, maybe by finding a way to manage the allergy or ensuring the son is involved in the decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The parent's intention was to accommodate their partner, but the decision was made without involving the son. The son's emotional investment in the cat is significant, and the parent didn't address that. The answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the son's feelings and made a unilateral decision. However, some might argue that the parent was trying to prioritize their own happiness and the partner's health. But since the cat was the son's, and the parent didn't discuss it with him, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
