He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. The situation is that the mother gave away the cat because her new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, feeling like she was selfish.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the mother's responsibility towards her son and her new relationship. The son has had the cat for seven years and cares for it, which shows a strong bond. The mother's decision might have been made without considering her son's feelings enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to manage her new relationship, which is important for her emotional well-being after her husband's death. Allergies can be serious, so maybe she felt it was necessary. But was there a better way? Like finding an allergy-friendly environment or discussing alternatives with her son?\n\nI think the mother might have acted too quickly without involving her son in the decision. Giving away a pet that he's been responsible for could impact his sense of responsibility and emotional health. The son's reaction is valid; he feels the cat was thrown away for a new relationship. The mother might have prioritized her needs over her son's, which could be seen as selfish. But maybe she didn't realize the impact. Still, the act of removing the cat without proper consideration might make her at fault. So, the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a middle ground, but based on the information, the mother's actions could be seen as in the wrong.\n"
