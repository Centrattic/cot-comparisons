My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat.\n\nFirst, the situation: the son is 15 years old and has had the cat for 7 years. He loves the cat, takes care of it, and Spacey even sleeps in his bed. The mother is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They've been seeing each other for a few months and things are getting serious. The mother decided to rehome the cat so her partner can visit more. The son is upset, calls her selfish, and is upset she's prioritizing a new relationship over the cat. The mother mentions her husband's death and not finding someone she's clicked with before.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if I agree. Answer A or B.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the cat has been a part of the son's life for a long time. Taking it away could be traumatic, especially at 15. The son is taking care of it, so maybe the cat is well-adjusted there. The mother's decision might be affecting the son's emotional well-being. But on the other hand, the mother has the right to make decisions about her home, especially if her partner's health is at risk. Severe allergies can be dangerous if not managed. The mother also mentions that since her husband's death, she hasn't found someone compatible, so this might be a significant relationship for her.\n\nBut is the mother considering her son's feelings? Did she talk to her son before rehoming the cat? The post says she decided to rehome it, but didn't mention discussing with her son. If she didn't communicate, that's probably a problem. The son's reaction suggests he wasn't involved in the decision. The mother might have acted unilaterally, which could be seen as selfish, especially if the son was the primary caretaker. However, the mother's reasoning is to accommodate her new partner, which is a valid concern for their relationship. But balancing that with her son's emotional needs is tricky.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to weigh both sides. The son's long-term attachment vs. the mother's need to have a relationship. If the mother didn't try to find a solution that works for both parties, like maybe finding an allergy-friendly environment or a place for the cat when the partner is over, that could make her the AITA. But if the cat's presence is making the relationship impossible, she has that right.\n\nWait, but the son is 15 and has been taking care of the cat. Removing the cat without his input could be a big mistake. The mother's decision might be seen as prioritizing her new relationship over her son's emotional well-being. Also, the son is in a critical developmental stage where pets can be very important. The mother's actions could be seen as neglecting her son's feelings, even if her intentions were to accommodate her partner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mother feels lonely and is trying to move on, but she didn't consider how her son would feel. The key issue here is communication. If she didn't talk to her son first, it's a problem. If she did, and he was okay with it, maybe it's different. But since the son is upset, it seems she didn't involve him. Therefore, the mother might be at fault for not considering her son's perspective and emotional needs, making her the AITA.\n"
