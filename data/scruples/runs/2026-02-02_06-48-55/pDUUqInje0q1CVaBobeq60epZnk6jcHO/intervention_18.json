He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a parent who rehomed their son's cat because their new partner is allergic to cats. The son is 15 and has had the cat for 7 years. He's upset, feeling like the mother is being selfish. The mother mentions that her husband recently passed away, and she hasn't met anyone else like this before. She's trying to move forward with the relationship but is causing her son distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother's reasoning is about her new relationship and her partner's severe allergy. On the other hand, the son's emotional attachment to the cat is significant. The key points here are the mother's right to make decisions for her household versus the son's emotional well-being.\n\nThe author's actions led to the son feeling hurt and accused of being selfish. The mother might not have considered the son's feelings sufficiently before making the decision. Rehoming a pet is a big deal, especially one the son has cared for so long. Even if the mother's intention was to accommodate the new partner, she might have failed to involve the son in the decision-making process. Perhaps there were alternatives, like getting an allergen-reducing cat or medication, but those might not have been feasible if the allergy is severe.\n\nAlso, the mother's personal circumstances\u2014grieving her husband and entering a new relationship\u2014add context. However, the son's reaction suggests that the decision was made without his input. The question is whether the mother's action was reasonable given her situation versus the emotional impact on her son. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at intent and consequences. The mother's intent was to make room for her new relationship, but the consequence was significant emotional harm to her son. Whether that's justified depends on cultural norms and individual perspectives. Some might side with the mother, understanding her need to move forward, while others might think she should have found another solution without giving up the cat.\n\nI think the mother made a mistake in not discussing it with her son first. Rehoming a pet isn't something to be done unilaterally, especially when the child is so attached. Even if the allergy is real, there might have been compromises. The son's reaction is valid because losing a pet is traumatic. The mother's actions could be seen as prioritizing her new relationship over her son's emotional needs, which is why some might say she's in the wrong. But others might empathize with her situation. However, the key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for her son's feelings. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
