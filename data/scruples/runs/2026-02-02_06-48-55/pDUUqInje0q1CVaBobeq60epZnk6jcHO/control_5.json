It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, saying they were selfish. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: they've lost their husband, are in a serious relationship now, and the partner can't be around cats. They can't have the partner over often, so they decided to rehome the cat. The son is upset because the cat has been with him for 7 years and he takes care of it. The son feels like the author is prioritizing the new partner over their relationship with the cat.\n\nSo, the main issue is balancing the son's emotional attachment to the cat versus the new partner's health. Allergies can be serious, especially if it's more than just sniffles. But the son is 15, so he's a teenager, which can be a time of heightened emotions. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the son fully. Did they talk to the son about it before giving the cat away? The question doesn't say, but the son yelled at her, implying there was some conflict after the decision was made. If the author didn't involve the son in the decision, that could be a problem. Also, the son has been caring for the cat for 7 years, so it's not just the parent's decision but also the son's pet. The author might have a responsibility to consider the son's feelings here. On the other hand, the new partner's health is a valid concern, and the author might feel the need to prioritize that for a serious relationship. But is rehoming the cat the only solution? Could there be alternatives like finding an allergy-friendly environment or maybe the partner could manage the allergy with medication? The severity of the allergy would matter here. If it's truly severe and the partner can't be in the house without symptoms, then the author might not have a choice. But maybe the author could have tried to find a compromise first. The fact that the author didn't mention discussing this with the son before making the decision points towards a lack of communication, which might be where they went wrong. The son's reaction is understandable because the cat was his pet. So the author's action might be seen as not respecting the son's autonomy and emotional bond with the pet. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve the son in the decision and prioritized the partner's needs without considering the son's feelings adequately.\n"
