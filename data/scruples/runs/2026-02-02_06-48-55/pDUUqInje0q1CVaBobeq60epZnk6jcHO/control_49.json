He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is allergic. The son is upset, thinking the author was selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. He's clearly attached. The author's new partner has a severe allergy, which affects their relationship. The author feels they didn't have a choice but to rehome the cat to make things work with their partner.\n\nOn one hand, the son's feelings are valid. Losing a pet after seven years is tough, especially when it's a beloved companion. The son might feel that his parent is prioritizing a new relationship over his well-being. The author didn't consult with the son before giving the cat away, which might be a problem. Involving the son in the decision could have lessened the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with their own emotional needs after the death of their husband. They might be trying to move on and build a new relationship. The partner's severe allergy isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a health issue that requires accommodation. The author might feel that keeping the cat isn't feasible if the partner can't visit often, which could strain the relationship.\n\nBut here's the catch: the cat belongs to the son, not the author. The author made a decision without the son's consent, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intention was good, the son's autonomy in keeping his pet is important. The author could have explored other options first, like finding an allergen-reducing solution, or helping the son adjust to the change instead of removing the cat without discussion.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication and inclusion of the son in the decision-making process. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the allergy is a real problem, but the way the decision was made (without involving the son) is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
