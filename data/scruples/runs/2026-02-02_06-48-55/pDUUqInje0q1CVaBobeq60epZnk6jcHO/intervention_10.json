He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset and thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the new partner can't visit often due to the allergy, and since the author hasn't had a serious relationship since her husband's death, she's trying to make this work. The son has had the cat for seven years, cares for it, and is now upset. \n\nOn one hand, the author is making a decision that affects her son's emotional well-being. Giving away a pet that's been part of the son's life for so long could be seen as a betrayal. The son's reaction of yelling and feeling selfish might indicate that the decision was made without enough consultation or consideration of his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance her own needs and happiness in a new relationship. Allergies can be serious, and if the partner can't be around the cat, it's understandable that the author would want to find a solution. However, the method of solving it by giving away the pet without the son's consent might be problematic. The son is 15, which is a young age, but he's been responsible for the cat for seven years. The author might have considered alternatives like finding an allergy-friendly environment or maybe even discussing with the partner if there's a compromise, but she chose to rehome the cat instead.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Did the author talk to her son first? If not, that could be an issue. Even if the decision is made for a good reason, not involving her son in the process might be seen as selfish. Also, the son's emotional attachment versus the author's need for her partner's comfort. The author's husband passed away, so she's trying to find someone new, which is valid, but the approach taken might have been too abrupt.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably, without considering others' feelings. Here, the author might be seen as prioritizing her new relationship over her son's feelings without adequate discussion. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't involve her son in the decision and caused him emotional harm, even if her intentions were to make the relationship work.\n"
