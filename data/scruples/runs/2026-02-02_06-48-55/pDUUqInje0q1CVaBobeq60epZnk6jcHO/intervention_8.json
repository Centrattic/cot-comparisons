He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away their son's cat because the new partner is allergic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son is 15 and has had the cat for 7 years. The son takes care of the cat well and is really upset. The author is in a new, serious relationship where the partner has a severe cat allergy. They can't have the partner over often because of this. The author decided to rehome the cat without consulting the son, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Option A says yes, B says no. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision might be considered selfish if they didn't involve the son in the decision. The son has been the primary caregiver, so giving away the cat without his input could hurt him. The son's emotional well-being is important here. Also, the author mentions that after the husband's death, they haven't met anyone they clicked with, implying they might be prioritizing the new relationship over the son's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to make the relationship work, and allergies are a legitimate health issue. They might feel they need to make a compromise. However, communication is key here. The author didn't consult the son, which is a problem. Maybe there was another solution, like finding an allergy-friendly environment or helping the son adjust to the situation if the cat had to go. The fact that the son is 15 also matters\u2014he's old enough to be involved in such a decision.\n\nAnother angle: The author could have discussed options with the son and partner. Perhaps they could have found a place for the cat, or the partner could have accommodations made. But the author made the decision unilaterally, leading to the son feeling betrayed. The son calls the author selfish, which might be valid if the author didn't consider his feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the lack of communication and involving the son. Even if the author's intention was to prioritize the new relationship, not involving the son was a mistake. The son's bond with the cat is significant, and his reaction shows the emotional impact. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting and for possibly prioritizing the partner's health over the son's emotional needs without finding a middle ground.\n"
