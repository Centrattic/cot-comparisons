It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for giving away her son's cat. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe key points here are: her son has had the cat, Spacey, for 7 years. He loves it, and takes care of it well. The author started dating someone who's severely allergic to cats. She can't have this person over often because of the allergy. She decided to rehome the cat, which made her son very upset. The son yelled at her, called her selfish and throwing away Spacey for a man she hasn't known long. The author mentions that after her husband's death, she hasn't met someone she clicked with, implying she's in a serious relationship now.\n\nFirst, the author's decision was based on her partner's severe allergy. That's a valid concern because severe allergies can be dangerous. She wants to maintain a relationship that allows her partner to visit, which is reasonable. But the son's emotional response is significant. He's been caring for the cat for 7 years; giving it away might feel like a loss and abandonment to him.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to balance her current relationship with her son's needs. On the other hand, she didn't consult her son before making the decision, which might have been a mistake. The son's feelings are hurt, and he feels she prioritized the new relationship over his emotional well-being.\n\nI need to consider if she had other options. Could she have found a solution that kept the cat and her partner's health in mind? Maybe the partner could have taken allergy meds, or maybe the cat could have been rehomed in a way that minimized disruption. But the severity of the allergy suggests that those options might not be feasible.\n\nHowever, the author didn't involve her son in the decision-making. That lack of communication could exacerbate the situation. The son's reaction is understandable given the bond with the cat. The author's explanation about her husband's death and forming a new relationship might add context to her actions, but it doesn't necessarily justify not discussing it with her son first.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were to accommodate her partner's health, which is important. But the way she handled it without her son's input might be where she's at fault. The son's emotional well-being is also important, and she might have a responsibility to consider both her partner's and her son's needs. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she made a decision that significantly impacted her son without his input, even though her reasons might be understandable. The son's feelings and the long-term bond with the cat should have been considered more carefully. However, there's also a case for B if one prioritizes the partner's health and the practical aspects of the allergy. But given the emotional impact on the son and the lack of communication, A makes more sense.\n"
