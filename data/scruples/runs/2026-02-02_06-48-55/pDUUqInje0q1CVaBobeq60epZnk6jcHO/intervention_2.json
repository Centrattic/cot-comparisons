It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic to cats, and the son is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. The author's reasoning is that they want to be with their new partner, who has a serious allergy, so they can't have the cat around. On the other hand, the son has had the cat for seven years and is very attached. He feels like the author is being selfish by giving up the cat for a new relationship.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's decision was probably made out of necessity to accommodate their partner's health. Allergies can be serious, and if the partner can't be around the cat, it's a real issue for their relationship. However, the son's feelings are also valid. The cat has been part of his life for a long time, and losing a pet can be really traumatic for a teenager.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility towards their son versus their responsibility towards their new partner. The author mentions that since the husband's death, they haven't met anyone they clicked with, so maybe the relationship with the new partner is significant. But the son is still grieving his father and now has to deal with losing the cat, which might be a source of comfort for him.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author considered alternatives. For example, could they have found a solution that allows both the cat to stay and the partner to be safe? Maybe using air purifiers, keeping the cat out of certain areas, or other allergy management strategies. If the author didn't explore these options and just decided to rehome the cat, that could be seen as hasty or not considering the son's feelings enough.\n\nAlso, the son's emotional reaction is important. He yelled and called the author selfish, which shows a lot of hurt. The author might not have fully communicated their reasons or involved the son in the decision-making process. If the author had discussed this with the son first, perhaps they could have found a compromise or at least helped the son understand the decision better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their needs and new relationship are also important, especially after being alone for a while. They might feel that giving up the cat was necessary to have a fulfilling relationship again. But the son's well-being is also a parent's responsibility, so there's a balance to consider.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author acted with sufficient consideration for their son's feelings and explored all possible alternatives. If the author acted hastily without considering other options or the son's perspective, then they might be at fault. But if they made a difficult decision for a legitimate reason and tried to do what's best overall, then they might not be in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at the intent and the process. If the author didn't communicate properly or considered alternatives, that's a point against them. If they did, then maybe not. Since the story mentions the author didn't know what else to do, it's possible they didn't explore all options, which could make them have some fault. But the situation is complex, so maybe the answer is not straightforward.\n"
