He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she gave away her son's cat because her new partner is allergic. The son was upset, thinking she's being selfish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. The mother's reasoning is that she's in a more serious relationship now and can't have the partner over often because of the allergy. She might feel that keeping the cat isn't feasible for her new relationship. On the other hand, the son loved the cat and saw it as a betrayal.\n\nI should check if there were other options. Did she try to find another solution before rehoming the cat? Maybe she could have gotten an allergy medication for the partner, or maybe the cat could stay in a separate area of the house. But she says the allergy is severe, so maybe those options aren't viable. Also, the son takes care of the cat, so giving it away might not be in the cat's best interest either.\n\nThe mother has been alone since her husband's death, so meeting someone serious is important to her. However, the son's emotional well-being is also a factor. Was she transparent with her son about the decision and her reasons? If she didn't involve him in the process, maybe that's where she went wrong. The son feels like she's prioritizing a new relationship over his feelings and the cat's home.\n\nBut the mother might argue that she's trying to balance her own happiness and her son's needs. However, the cat was her son's pet, so the decision should involve him. Maybe she should have discussed it with him first, given him a chance to find a solution, or perhaps they could have found a way to keep the cat while accommodating the new partner. If the allergy was a deal-breaker and no other solutions were possible, then maybe she had to make a tough choice. But the way she did it without considering her son's feelings might be the issue here.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she didn't communicate properly with her son and made the decision unilaterally, that could be a problem. The son's reaction suggests that he felt his attachment to the cat was disregarded. The mother might not be in the wrong for the decision itself if the allergy is serious, but maybe she mishandled the situation by not involving her son. Therefore, she might be at least partially in the wrong for not considering his feelings and not exploring all options with him.\n"
