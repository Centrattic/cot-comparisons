It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's son has had the cat for seven years. The son loves the cat, takes care of it, and they even sleep together. The parent is in a new relationship where the partner is severely allergic. So they decided to rehome the cat because they can't have the partner over often. The son is upset, accusing the parent of being selfish. The parent hasn't been in a serious relationship since their husband's death, and now they're trying to make this work with someone new.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to balance their son's emotional needs and their new relationship. On one hand, the son has a strong bond with the cat. On the other hand, the parent is dealing with their own life and forming a new relationship. The allergy isn't mild, so it's a legitimate concern for the partner's health. The parent might feel that keeping the cat would hinder the relationship's progress.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? Well, the cat belonged to the son. If the parent made the decision without the son's input, that could be an issue. The son feels it's selfish, which suggests he didn't agree with the decision. The parent might not have considered alternative solutions, like keeping the cat but limiting when the partner visits, using air purifiers, or finding a new home for the cat before the relationship became serious. \n\nHowever, the parent's actions might be seen as trying to prioritize their own happiness after a period of loneliness. They might not have realized the emotional impact on their son. Alternatively, they might have thought they were acting in the best interest of the relationship and their own well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent should have involved the son in the decision-making process. Since the cat was the son's, the parent should have considered his feelings more. But the parent's intention was to address a real problem with the new partner. \n\nSo, was the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. They had a valid reason, but they didn't consider the son's feelings enough. The answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because they gave away the son's cat without his agreement, especially since he was the primary caretaker. But there's also the aspect of the parent's need to build a new relationship. However, the key point is that the cat belonged to the son, so the parent's decision without his consent might be the issue here. The parent should have discussed alternatives with the son first. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
