He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving away a son's cat because the new partner is allergic.\n\nFirst, the son has had the cat for 7 years and really loves it. The mother made the decision to rehome the cat to accommodate her new partner, who has a severe allergy. The son is upset, feeling it's selfish. The mother mentions that her late husband's absence has made it hard to meet someone she clicks with, implying she's trying to move on.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mother's responsibility is to her own well-being and new relationship, but also to her son's feelings. The son's attachment to the cat is significant. However, the mother's new partner can't be around due to allergies, which might affect their relationship's progression. \n\nIs the mother being selfish? Maybe, but she's balancing her needs after a loss. The son might not understand the pressure of having a serious relationship again after her husband's death. On the other hand, the cat was her son's pet; giving it away without his consent could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the mother did mention her son takes care of the cat well. Maybe she felt it's the best for everyone, even if the son is upset. The partner's allergy is severe, so it's a health issue. The mother might not have other options, like moving or the partner managing the allergy. \n\nThe key points are: the cat is the son's, but the mother made the decision for her new relationship. The son's upset is valid, but the mother's actions are for her own happiness and health considerations. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on empathy and fairness. The mother's intention might be seen as trying to balance her new relationship and her son's needs, but without the son's agreement. However, the severity of the allergy is a legitimate health concern. \n\nI'm leaning towards the mother not being in the wrong (B) because she's dealing with personal circumstances and a health issue, but there's a valid argument that she should have considered her son's feelings more. However, given the context, her decision is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
