It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though).

My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's son is 15 and has had the cat, Spacey, for seven years. The son loves the cat a lot and takes care of him. The author is now dating someone with a severe cat allergy, which isn't life-threatening but significant. They've been seeing each other for a few months and things are getting serious. The author decided to rehome the cat because of the partner's allergy. The son is upset, calling the author selfish and throwing away the cat for someone they haven't known long. The author mentions that since her husband died, she hasn't met anyone she clicked with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities involved. The son is a minor, so legally, the parent has the authority to make decisions regarding pets. However, the emotional impact on the son is significant. The son has cared for the cat for seven years, so it's a big part of his life. The parent might have considered the partner's health, which is important, but maybe didn't involve the son enough in the decision.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that they didn't know what else to do. But perhaps there were alternatives, like finding an allergy-friendly solution, such as medication, air purifiers, or maybe keeping the cat in a specific room. Also, maybe they could have discussed the matter with the son and found a compromise, like giving the cat to a relative or friend instead of rehoming it to a stranger, which might have been less traumatic.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might feel that the relationship is important and that the allergy is a genuine issue that affects their quality of life. The parent might also feel that they haven't found someone they truly connected with since her husband's death, so this relationship is significant.\n\nBut the key point here is the son's emotional well-being versus the parent's consideration for the new partner. The son's reaction suggests that he felt his needs were overlooked. The parent might have been too hasty in making the decision without considering the son's feelings and possibly not exploring all other options first.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on whether they acted responsibly. If they didn't involve the son in the decision, didn't consider alternatives, and prioritized the partner's health without adequately addressing the son's emotional impact, then maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if the allergy was a genuine problem and they made a tough but necessary choice, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way it was handled\u2014without involving the son\u2014could be problematic.\n\nI think the parent should have communicated better with the son and perhaps explored other solutions before deciding to rehome the cat. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong. But there's also a valid reason related to the partner's health. So it's a bit of a complex situation. However, the fact that the son was so upset and felt disrespected might tip the balance towards the parent being in the wrong here.\n"
