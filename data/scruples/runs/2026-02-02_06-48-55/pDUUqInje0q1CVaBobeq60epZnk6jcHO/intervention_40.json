He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent gave away their son's cat because their new partner is severely allergic. The son is upset, thinking the parent is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The cat has been with the son for 7 years. The parent is in a new relationship that's becoming more serious, and the partner can't handle the allergens. The parent might feel that giving up the cat is necessary for the relationship to progress, especially since they can't have the partner over often. But the son is very attached and is upset, feeling like the parent prioritized the new partner over the cat and his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent hasn't been in a relationship since the husband's death, so this might be a significant step for them. They might believe that the relationship is important and that the allergy is a valid reason. However, the son's emotional well-being is also a factor here. Did the parent consider alternatives, like finding a non-allergic partner or perhaps moving the cat to a different part of the house to accommodate the allergy?\n\nBut the parent might not have other options. If the allergy is severe, even small amounts of dander could be problematic. Maybe the parent tried to find a solution but couldn't, leading to rehoming the cat. However, the son might feel that the parent didn't talk through it properly or didn't consider the impact on him.\n\nAlso, the parent's decision to act without the son's input could be a point of contention. The son is 15, so while he's a teenager, he's still a minor. The parent has the legal right to make decisions, but the emotional aspect is crucial. Did the parent communicate the decision in a way that considered the son's feelings, or was it done abruptly?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parent's intention was to protect the relationship and address the allergy, but the son's emotional reaction suggests the decision affected him deeply. The parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to balance their needs and their new relationship, but they could have handled it better by involving the son more, perhaps finding a compromise instead of rehoming the cat immediately.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent had a valid reason and the allergy is a real issue. However, there's a valid argument that they didn't consider the son's feelings enough. But given the situation, the parent's actions are understandable, though perhaps not the best handled.\n"
