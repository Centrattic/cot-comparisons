He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old son who has had his cat, Spacey, for seven years. The son takes good care of the cat and is very attached to him. The mother recently started dating someone with a severe cat allergy, which complicates their relationship. She decided to rehome the cat, which upset her son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The son has had the cat for a long time and clearly values the pet. The mother's decision to rehome the cat affects her son's emotional well-being. On the other hand, the mother is dealing with the challenges of a serious relationship where her partner's health is a concern. She emphasizes that she hasn't been in a serious relationship since her husband's death, which adds context to her decision-making process.\n\nThe question is whether the mother's action was wrong. From a legal standpoint, as the parent, she has the authority to make decisions for the household, but emotionally, this is a sensitive situation. The son's reaction of feeling yelled at the mother for being selfish suggests that he feels his feelings and the cat's well-being were not considered. The mother might not have consulted the son properly, leading to his upset.\n\nHowever, the mother's intention was to accommodate her new partner's health needs in a serious relationship. It's a balancing act between the son's emotional attachment and the mother's need to build a new relationship. The severity of the allergy is a valid concern, affecting their ability to spend time together. But the decision to rehome the cat without the son's full agreement is problematic. The son may feel that his voice wasn't heard, which could strain their relationship further.\n\nConsidering both sides, the mother's action might be seen as a mistake because she didn't involve her son in the decision-making process. The son's long-term care for the cat and his emotional bond with it are significant factors. The mother might have found a middle ground, like finding an alternative solution that respects both the son's feelings and the partner's allergy. Therefore, the answer could be that the mother is in the wrong for not adequately considering her son's perspective and feelings in this decision.\n"
