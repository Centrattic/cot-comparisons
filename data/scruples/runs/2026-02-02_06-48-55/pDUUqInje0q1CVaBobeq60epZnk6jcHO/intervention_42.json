He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation involves the mother dating someone with a severe cat allergy, leading to her decision to rehome the cat. The son is upset and feels betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's dating someone with a serious allergy, which makes it hard to have the partner over. Since her husband's death, she hasn't found someone compatible, implying she might be prioritizing this relationship. However, the cat has been with the son for 7 years, and he's clearly attached. The mother might think she's making a tough but necessary decision for her new relationship.\n\nOn the son's side, he's 15 and has had the cat since he was 8. The cat is a significant part of his life, and giving it away suddenly must be very hurtful. He's upset because he feels his mom is being selfish for someone else. The son's reaction is valid\u2014losing a pet is a big deal, especially for a teenager. The mother didn't consult him beforehand, which could exacerbate his feelings of betrayal.\n\nNow, the mother's decision to rehome the cat without the son's input might be seen as disregarding his feelings. Even if the allergy is severe, there might be alternatives. Maybe she could have tried finding a hypoallergenic environment, or communicated with the partner about the situation. But the partner's severe allergy might make that difficult. Still, the son's emotional well-being is important, and the mother's action might have been too hasty.\n\nHowever, the mother is dealing with her own loneliness after her husband's death. She might feel that this relationship is important, and the allergy issue is a barrier. But she has a responsibility to consider her son's feelings. The key point is whether she gave the son a chance to discuss alternatives. If she acted without his input, that could be where the fault lies.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the mother's need for a relationship is understandable, but the way she handled it\u2014without involving her son\u2014might be the problem. The son's emotional reaction is valid given the bond with the cat. Therefore, the mother might be in the wrong for not considering her son's feelings and not exploring other options first.\n"
