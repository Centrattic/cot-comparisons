He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son is 15 and has had the cat for seven years. The cat is a big part of his life, and he's upset. The parent is dating someone who's severely allergic to cats, not a minor allergy. They've been dating for a few months and have become more serious, so the parent decided to rehome the cat. The son is angry, calling the parent selfish. The parent mentions that since their husband's death, they haven't found someone they connected with, and they didn't know what else to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're in a new, more serious relationship, and their partner's health is a concern. Severe allergies can be dangerous, not just inconvenient. The parent might feel that they can't compromise on that, especially if they want to build a future with their new partner. However, they didn't consult the son before making the decision, which is a problem. The son has been taking care of the cat for a long time, so the emotional impact is significant. The parent's action might be seen as selfish, but they might also feel they had no other choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is 15, which is a teenage year, so emotional issues can be more intense. The parent should have involved the son in the decision-making process. Maybe there's a compromise possible, like finding a new place for the cat while allowing the son to visit it, but the parent didn't consider alternatives. The key points here are communication, the child's emotional well-being, and the parent's responsibility to consider both their own relationship and their child's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The parent's intention was to accommodate their partner's health needs, which is valid. But the method\u2014suddenly giving away the cat without the son's input\u2014might be where they went wrong. The parent should have discussed it with the son to find a solution that respects both the partner's allergy and the son's attachment. So, the parent is not entirely in the wrong because they had a genuine reason, but they did make a mistake by not involving the son. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. The answer depends on whether the action was justified despite the method. Since the parent acted unilaterally, they might be considered in the wrong for not considering the son's feelings adequately. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer leans towards the parent not being entirely wrong but could have handled it better. But in terms of AITA, the community might side more on the parent being in the wrong because they didn't communicate and made a significant decision affecting the child.\n"
