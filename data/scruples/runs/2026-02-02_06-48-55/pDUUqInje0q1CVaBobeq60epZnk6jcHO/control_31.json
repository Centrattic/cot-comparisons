He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving away their son's cat. The situation is that the son is 15, had the cat for 7 years, and the author is dating someone with a severe cat allergy. They decided to rehome the cat, which upset the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author's actions were driven by their new relationship and the allergic reaction. The son felt betrayed, thinking the author was being selfish. The author mentions that since the husband's death, they haven't met someone they connected with, implying they're prioritizing their new relationship.\n\nOn one hand, the cat is the son's pet, and giving it away without his consent could be seen as disregarding his feelings. However, the author is dealing with their own needs and the health of their partner. The severity of the allergy is a factor here; if the partner can't be around the cat, it's a legitimate concern for their well-being.\n\nBut was there an attempt to find a middle ground? For example, maybe trying to find an alternative like a hypoallergenic cat or setting up a cat-free area in the home. The author didn't mention these options, which could have been considered. Also, the son being 15 is old enough to feel a strong emotional attachment, so communication and involving him in the decision might have helped.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't know what else to do, but perhaps they could have explored other solutions before rehoming. The son's reaction is valid because the cat has been part of his life for years. However, the author's situation is also valid, as they're navigating a new serious relationship with health implications.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a valid reason, but they might have mishandled the situation by not involving the son or looking for alternatives. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and how much weight is given to the parent's new relationship versus the child's feelings. Since the question is binary (A or B), I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Considering the lack of alternatives considered and the impact on the son, there's a case for AITA, but also understanding the author's position. However, since the son didn't agree and the cat is his, the author might be seen as overstepping, making the answer more towards A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The key points are: the cat is the son's, 7 years, and the author's decision without his input. The allergy is severe. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong because they had a health reason, but others might say A. It's tricky. In AITA scenarios, people often consider the child's feelings, so maybe A. But I'm not certain.\n"
