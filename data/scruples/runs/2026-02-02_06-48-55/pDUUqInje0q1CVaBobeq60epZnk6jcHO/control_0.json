He loves Spacey, he sleeps on my sons bed, and son takes care of him quite well. I recently started to date someone who is allergic to cats. It\u2019s not a sniffle allergy, but a pretty severe one (not deathly though). My partner and I have started to get more serious - we\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months now, and I can\u2019t have him over often because of his allergy. So I decided to rehome Spacey. My son is very upset about this and yelled at me, saying I was selfish and throwing Space away for some man I haven\u2019t known for very long. Since my husbands death I haven\u2019t really met anyone I have clicked with. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who gave away their son's cat is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old son who has had the cat for seven years and is very attached to it. The parent is dating someone with a severe cat allergy, and they decided to rehome the cat to make the relationship work. The son is upset, calling the parent selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're in a new relationship, and the partner's health is a significant factor. Severe allergies can affect quality of life, so maybe the parent felt this was necessary for their own happiness and the relationship's future. But then there's the child's emotional well-being. The son has been taking care of the cat for years; losing a pet can be traumatic, especially for a teenager. The parent might have overlooked the emotional impact without considering alternatives.\n\nAlternative solutions could include finding a hypoallergenic cat, using air purifiers, or having the cat stay at the parent's place when the partner visits. However, the parent didn't mention these options. The son felt betrayed, which complicates things. The parent's decision might have been made without proper communication or considering the child's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is grieving the loss of their spouse and trying to move forward. They might feel they haven't found someone compatible before. But the child's bond with the pet is long-standing. The parent's responsibility includes considering the child's emotional health as well. So, was the decision made too hastily without involving the son in the decision-making process? That's a key point. If the parent didn't consult the son or explore other options, that could be seen as where they went wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the parent balanced both the partner's health and the son's emotional needs adequately.\n"
