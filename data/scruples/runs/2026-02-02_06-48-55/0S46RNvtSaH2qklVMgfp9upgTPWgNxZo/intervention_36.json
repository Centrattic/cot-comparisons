I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with their girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy living alone in a city, paying rent, utilities, and groceries. His girlfriend, who is 23, wants to move in together. He's offering to split everything 50/50. She argues that since he makes $80k and she makes $45k, this is unfair. Her friends also side with her, calling him a jerk. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the division of expenses based on income. 50/50 split when one's income is significantly higher than the other's might not be fair. Typically, splitting costs proportionally to income is a common approach in relationships. If both are moving into the same place, the person with the higher income might contribute more to cover the shared expenses. \n\nThe author is making about double what his girlfriend is. If they split everything equally, he's effectively paying more than his share relative to his income. However, he's the one who already owns the place. Wait, no\u2014he's renting a place by himself. So when they move in together, she's joining him. So the existing rent is his responsibility now. If he's inviting her to live there, he might expect her to contribute, but perhaps not 50% if he's already covering it. \n\nWait, the situation might be a bit different. If he's renting a place he already pays for, and she moves in, then the rent doesn't change for him. So he's still paying the same amount, and she's moving in. In that case, maybe he's not expecting her to cover half the rent, but wants her to pay half. But if he's willing to split everything 50/50, that could mean he's expecting her to pay half of the existing rent plus utilities and groceries, which might be more than fair if he's making double. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apartment isn't big enough to split rent. If he's paying a certain rent for a one-bedroom and she moves in, maybe they upgrade to a two-bedroom, increasing the total rent. But the question doesn't specify that. The original rent is his, and she's joining him. So the rent doesn't change, but they split the costs. But that could mean he's not paying more but expecting her to pay half of the same rent, which isn't fair if he's making more. \n\nAnother angle: splitting costs equally might not account for the fact that he's already paying for the place. If she moves in, she's getting a place for half the cost of what she would pay on her own. But he's also getting a roommate for half the cost. But since he's the higher earner, it's fair that he contributes more. \n\nBut the author's perspective is he wants to split 50/50. The girlfriend's friends are on her side, saying he's being unreasonable. The user says he's in the wrong. The question is whether he is. \n\nI think the key here is the fairness of splitting based on income. In many relationships, it's common to split expenses proportionally to income. So if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, he's making 1.78 times her income. Therefore, he should pay a larger share. 50/50 would mean he's paying 1.78 times her income towards the expenses. That's not fair. \n\nAdditionally, since he's the one who already owns the place, maybe he's not in the position to demand an equal split. If he's inviting her to live with him, he should consider that she's paying a fair share based on her ability. So the author is in the wrong for not adjusting the split to account for their income differences. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
