I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The guy is 22, she's 23, they've been together 1.5 years. He rents a place alone after moving downtown for a job, and he earns $80k, while she makes $45k. He wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset, and her friends called him a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspects. The author's salary is almost double hers. A 50/50 split might not be fair if their incomes are different. Typically, when people split costs, it's often based on income. So if he's making twice as much, maybe he should pay more than half. The idea is that each person contributes a similar percentage of their income. For example, if the rent is $2000, he should pay $1333 and she $666 if he's making twice as much. But he's asking for 50/50, which would mean she's paying a larger percentage of her income. That could be a burden for her.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. They've been together 1.5 years, which isn't super long. Moving in together is a big step. The girlfriend might feel that the financial arrangement isn't equitable. The friends' opinions are mentioned, but they might not understand all the details. But the key issue is whether the author is being unreasonable by insisting on a 50/50 split despite the income difference. \n\nAnother point is that he's the one who owns the current place. If he's moving in together, maybe he's starting from a position where he's already paying rent alone. So splitting the cost 50/50 would mean he's not getting any benefit from his current situation. But if the new place is more expensive, maybe that's different. However, the problem here is the principle of splitting costs equally regardless of income.\n\nSo, in terms of fairness, it's about whether the split reflects their ability to pay. The author is making more, so expecting an equal split might be seen as unfair, making him responsible for the higher contribution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering the income disparity, which could lead to an unequal burden for his girlfriend. Hence, answer A.\n"
