      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend (F23). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. M22 is paying rent alone and recently moved to a place because of his job. He's making $80k a year, while his GF makes $45k. He's proposing that when they move in together, she should cover half of the rent, utilities, and groceries. The GF and her friends think this is unfair, calling him a \"douche\" and \"ass.\"\n\nNow, thinking about typical split living arrangements. Usually, splitting costs equally can vary. Some couples split based on income, others split 50/50 regardless. The key factors here are income disparity and the nature of splitting costs. \n\nM22's income is significantly higher. If they split everything 50/50, the GF is effectively paying a larger percentage of her income. For example, if the total monthly costs are $2000, each would pay $1000. That's about 22% of her income (1000/4500) versus 12.5% of his (1000/8000). That's a big difference. So from an equity standpoint, it might be more balanced if contributions were based on income. But M22's stance is on fairness of equal amounts, not percentages. \n\nHowever, some people argue that when you're in a committed relationship, splitting costs equally is fair because you're sharing the space and resources equally. Others think it's fair to split based on income to avoid financial strain on the lower earner. \n\nThe GF's friends' reaction is another point. They say he's being unreasonable. That might indicate social norms in their circle lean towards proportional splitting. But M22 might not see it that way, thinking that since he's in the same space, splitting equally is fair. \n\nAlso, the fact that M22 is the one who owns the place now and is asking the GF to join him might imply that he's expecting her to contribute equally to maintain the shared living. But if the GF's income is lower, she might struggle with that. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? It's subjective, but in terms of fairness, if they're sharing the place equally, a 50/50 split in terms of cost could be seen as fair. However, considering their income differences, it's also fair to adjust contributions accordingly. Since M22 is making more, he could contribute more to balance the percentage of each person's income. But he's not willing to do that, which might be why the GF and her friends see it as unfair. \n\nIn many relationships, couples discuss and agree on a system that works for both. The problem here is that M22 isn't open to negotiation, expecting a strict 50/50 split regardless of income. That could be where he's in the wrong because he's not considering her financial situation. Alternatively, if they both agree that 50/50 is acceptable, then it's not wrong. But since the GF is objecting and M22 is standing by his stance, it's possible he's being inflexible. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not accounting for the income disparity, leading to an unequal burden on the GF. But some might say B (not in the wrong) because 50/50 is fair for shared living. However, given the income difference and the response from his GF's friends, the consensus leans towards A. But I need to check if there's a standard on this. \n\nIn many cases, financial experts suggest splitting based on income when there's a significant disparity. So, if M22 isn't willing to adjust, he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
