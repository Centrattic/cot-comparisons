I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place alone, making $80k, and she makes $45k. He wants her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk because of their income difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs in relationships. Typically, people split expenses based on income or agree on another fair method. The author is suggesting 50/50 regardless of income. The girlfriend's argument is that since he earns more, he should contribute more. Her friends agree with her, which adds social pressure here.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs equally in terms of percentage might not be fair if incomes differ. For example, if one person makes significantly more, they might pay a larger share to balance the financial burden. The author's stance could be seen as not considering their different financial situations. \n\nBut some might argue that splitting everything 50/50 is straightforward and avoids resentment. However, given the income disparity, it's reasonable for the girlfriend to expect the higher earner to contribute more. The author's refusal to adjust the split based on income could be perceived as not being considerate of each other's financial realities.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's friends supporting her viewpoint suggests that societal norms in their circle lean towards shared responsibility adjusted for income. The author's insistence on 50/50 might be seen as not being flexible or considerate in this context.\n\nSo, the key points are income disparity and fairness. The author's approach doesn't account for their different earnings, which could be why the girlfriend and her friends are upset. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not adjusting the split to reflect their financial situations.\n"
