      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old male, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since he graduated and moved downtown for a job. She wants to move in together, and he's insisting she pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends call him a douche.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Typically, splitting equally is common, but some factors like income disparity might influence that. The author's income is almost double hers. So, if they split 50/50, the girlfriend would be contributing a larger percentage of her income compared to the author.\n\nFinancial fairness is often a topic in relationships. Some argue that contributions should be proportional to income, especially if there's a significant difference. Others say that splitting equally is fair because it's a shared space and resources. The author might be coming from a place of wanting fairness in terms of absolute amounts, while the girlfriend and her friends see it as unfair because of the income difference.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't mention discussing the financial arrangement beforehand. Maybe he assumed equal split, but she expected something else. It's possible that the girlfriend feels the split isn't fair given their earnings, and her friends agree. The author might not be wrong, but there's room for discussion and adjustment. \n\nAlso, considering their relationship duration, they might be at a stage where financial expectations need to be aligned. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible, but he's also trying to be fair. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she feels the split is a burden on her. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is wrong depends on societal norms and what they agree upon. However, since the girlfriend and her friends perceive it as unfair, maybe the author should reconsider. But from a strict 50/50 split perspective, he's not necessarily wrong. It's a matter of differing viewpoints on fairness. Maybe the answer is B (No), because wanting to split equally isn't inherently wrong, but the situation could benefit from a more nuanced approach considering their income difference.\n"
