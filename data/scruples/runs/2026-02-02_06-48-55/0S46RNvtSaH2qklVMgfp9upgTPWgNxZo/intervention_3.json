I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a guy making $80k, and his girlfriend is making $45k. He wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks it's unfair and her friends agree.\n\nFirst, the core issue is fairness in splitting costs based on income. The author's reasoning might be that they're sharing a space equally, so costs should be split equally. But the girlfriend argues that since her income is significantly lower, splitting 50/50 isn't fair. Her friends back her up, which adds social pressure.\n\nI need to consider common practices. In many relationships, splitting costs equally can be standard, but when incomes are drastically different, that might not be fair. Some might argue that the higher earner should contribute more to balance the financial responsibilities. However, others might say that if both are living in the same space, equal split is reasonable regardless of income. \n\nThe key points are the income disparity and the perception of fairness. The girlfriend's friends labeling the author as a \"douche\" suggests a cultural norm where splitting based on income is expected. The author might not have considered the income difference when proposing a 50/50 split. \n\nBut relationships are personal, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The author's stance is about equal contribution to shared expenses, which could be seen as fair if both are using the space equally. However, the income difference might mean that the financial burden on the lower earner is heavier proportionally. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the expectation is that contributions should be proportional to income. But if the expectation is equal split regardless of income, then maybe not. The girlfriend's friends' reaction implies that income should be considered, leading to the conclusion that the author's approach is not fair. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
