I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old male making $80k, and his girlfriend is 23, making $45k. He's currently renting alone since moving for a job, and she wants to move in together. He's insisting she pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting expenses. Often, people split costs based on income or needs. The author is making significantly more money, so expecting her to pay 50% might not account for the income disparity. If they split 50/50 regardless of income, she would be contributing a larger percentage of her earnings compared to him. For example, if rent is $2000, she would be paying $1000, which is about 22% of her income, while he's paying $1000, which is about 12.5% of his. That's a big difference in terms of financial burden.\n\nAnother angle is that when couples move in together, it's common to adjust expenses based on their financial situations. The author might be expecting her to cover half the costs without considering her lower income. His friends also think he's being a \"douche,\" which suggests that his approach isn't the norm. \n\nHowever, the author could argue that splitting costs 50/50 is fair in terms of the actual amount, not the percentage of income. If he's paying for the apartment alone, moving her in and splitting might make sense to him as equal sharing. But the issue here is that fairness can be subjective. What's fair to one person might not be to another, especially when there's a significant income gap.\n\nAlso, the fact that she asked her friends and they supported her view indicates that the author's stance is seen as unfair by others. The author's reasoning might not take into account that a 50/50 split in dollar amount can be unfair in terms of proportion. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her financial situation and the common practice of splitting based on income.\n\nSo, the answer would be A) Yes, the author is in the wrong because he's not accounting for the income disparity and expecting an equal split regardless of that difference.\n"
