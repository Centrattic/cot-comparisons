I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split costs 50/50 when moving in with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy making $80k, and his girlfriend is 23, making $45k. They've been together for 1.5 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting living expenses. Typically, there's no one-size-fits-all answer because relationships vary. Some couples split expenses evenly, others split proportionally to their incomes, or based on usage. The author's approach is 50/50, but his GF and her friends think he's being unreasonable because of their income disparity.\n\nThe key points here are the income difference and the perception of fairness. The author argues for equal sharing, but the girlfriend might feel that since he earns more, he should contribute more. However, the author might see it as equal responsibility in the relationship. \n\nI should consider cultural or societal norms. Some might argue that expecting equal contributions is fair if both are contributing equally to the household, regardless of income. Others might think that splitting proportionally is fairer when there's a significant income difference. \n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship and their living situations matter. He's been living alone since moving for a job, so maybe he's used to managing his own finances. She might be used to a different setup. The fact that her friends agree she's right might indicate that her perspective is more common in her social circle, but that doesn't necessarily make it right universally.\n\nAnother angle: the cost of living. If moving in together is cheaper than both paying rent separately, splitting 50/50 could save money for both. But if the split is based on income, maybe the higher earner could take a larger share. However, the author's stance is about equal responsibility, not about saving money. \n\nPotential issues: The girlfriend might feel the split is unfair because she's contributing less financially, even though she's paying half. The author's reasoning could be that they're sharing the space equally, hence splitting costs equally. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: It's subjective. There's no ethical wrong unless there's coercion or agreement already. The author is stating his terms, and the disagreement is about differing expectations. So, neither is necessarily in the wrong, but the author's position might not consider the girlfriend's perspective. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is based on fairness, maybe the author isn't wrong because it's his home, and he's offering to split costs equally. But if fairness is based on income, then he might be. \n\nI think it's a no because the author is setting boundaries for his own living expenses, and wanting to split costs equally isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's friends might have a different opinion, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's more about mutual agreement. So the answer is B.\n"
