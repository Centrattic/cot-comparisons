I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years, he rents alone since moving for a job, and she wants to move in. He's asking her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks he's being unreasonable because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also side with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices around splitting costs in relationships. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. Some couples split things equally, while others adjust based on income. The key factors are communication, mutual agreement, and fairness.\n\nThe author is proposing a 50/50 split regardless of income difference. His GF argues that since he earns more, he should pay more. Her friends back her up. The question is whether expecting a 50/50 split is unreasonable given the income disparity.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs based on income is common. For example, if one person earns significantly more, they might pay a larger share. However, if the couple has equal financial commitments or similar expenses, a 50/50 split could still be acceptable. \n\nThe problem here is that the author hasn't considered the income difference. If they move in together, the total cost (rent, utilities, groceries) will likely be less than if they lived separately, but the split needs to be fair. If he's making almost double her income, maybe he should cover a larger portion. \n\nBut there's another angle: he's the one who has his own place already. If they move in together, she's joining him, which could mean he's already in a position where he's established the home. It's possible that he's expecting her to take on half the cost without considering that he might have more financial flexibility. \n\nOn the other hand, wanting to split costs equally isn't inherently wrong. It's a matter of negotiation. The issue is that the author hasn't been open to negotiation based on their income differences. If he's rigid about 50/50 without considering their financial situations, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, the fact that his GF asked her friends and they all agreed he's in the wrong might indicate that his stance isn't aligned with common expectations. However, friends' opinions can vary, so that's not definitive.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering the income disparity and is insisting on an equal split without flexibility. AITA usually looks at intent and fairness. If the author is willing to adjust after discussion, it's different, but based on the current info, he's being inflexible. Therefore, answer A.\n"
