I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting living costs 50/50 between a boyfriend and girlfriend. The guy makes $80k, the girl $45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices in splitting costs in relationships. A 50/50 split is common when both partners are contributing equally, regardless of income. But some people argue that splitting based on income might be fairer if there's a significant income disparity. \n\nThe guy's argument is that he wants to split costs equally, which is a fair approach if they're both living in the same space and using the same resources. However, the girl's perspective is that since he earns more, it's unfair for her to pay half when her income is lower. Her friends back her up, which adds social pressure on the guy. \n\nBut wait, the guy is already paying for the place by himself. If they move in together, the total costs (rent, utilities, groceries) would increase, but splitting 50/50 might not account for the difference in their earnings. However, the guy might not want to be the sole financial provider in the relationship beyond just covering his own expenses. \n\nIs 50/50 inherently wrong if incomes differ? It depends on the couple's agreement. Some people believe in splitting costs equally, others in splitting proportionally. The key here is whether the guy's stance is unreasonable. If he's open to negotiation, maybe there's a middle ground, but the way he presented it (\"she'd have to cover half\") might come across as non-negotiable, leading to his being seen as in the wrong. \n\nThe girl's reaction and her friends' opinion suggest that the community might view 50/50 as unfair when there's a significant income gap. The guy might be seen as not considering the financial balance in the relationship. However, his desire for equality in contribution is understandable. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The girl's perspective and the friends' reactions indicate that the community might side with her. So the answer might be A. But I should check if splitting 50/50 is a standard practice regardless of income. If that's the case, maybe he's not wrong. But if splitting proportionally is more acceptable in such situations, then he is. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting 50/50 is common, but when there's a large income disparity, some might argue that splitting proportionally is better. The problem here is that the guy's stance is rigid, leading to conflict. The fact that she and her friends find it a \"huge dick move\" suggests that the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
