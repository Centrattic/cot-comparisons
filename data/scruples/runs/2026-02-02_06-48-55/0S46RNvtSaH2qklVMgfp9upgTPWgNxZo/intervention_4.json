I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend (F23). The situation is that the author is making $80k and his girlfriend $45k, and she's upset that he expects her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. Her friends also called him a douche for that.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate it.\n\nFirst, splitting living costs 50/50 isn't inherently wrong, but the fairness might depend on the income disparity. If both are contributing equally in percentage terms, that could be more equitable. For example, if the rent is $2000/month, the author would be contributing $1000 (1.25% of his income) versus the girlfriend contributing $1000 (2.22% of her income). That's a bigger chunk of her income, so splitting equally might not be fair if their incomes differ significantly.\n\nHowever, splitting 50/50 is common in relationships where both parties can afford it. The issue here might be that the author isn't considering the income difference. Maybe a split based on income proportions would be fairer. Alternatively, if they are in a long-term relationship, expecting equal contribution regardless of income could be seen as unreasonable if one partner is contributing a larger portion of their income.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends think the author is a douche, which suggests that in her social circle, splitting based on income is considered fairer. The author's reasoning might be that he's paying for the apartment himself, so sharing would mean splitting costs equally, but that might not account for their different financial situations.\n\nAnother angle: if they're moving in together, maybe the author expects her to contribute to the overall household expenses equally, which is a common practice. But if her income is significantly lower, expecting her to pay half might strain her finances more. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her financial capacity. However, if they agreed on 50/50 without considering income, it's a mutual decision, but he's being blamed for suggesting it.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs based on income can be fair, but there's no one-size-fits-all approach. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by not adjusting the split according to their earnings. Since his income is higher, expecting her to pay half might be seen as unfair, thus he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
