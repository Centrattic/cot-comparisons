      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old male, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for a year and a half. He rents a place alone since he moved downtown for a job, which he started last June. She wants to move in together, and he's insisting she cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k, and her friends called him a douche for wanting her to pay half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of splitting costs in a relationship. Typically, when two people move in together, splitting expenses equally is common, but it's not the only way. Some couples split based on income, where the person earning more pays a larger share. The author's reasoning is to split everything 50/50, which is a standard approach, but his significant income difference might affect the fairness of that split.\n\nThe key points here are income disparity and expectations. The author makes $80k, and she makes $45k. If they split rent and utilities 50/50, he's contributing a smaller percentage of his income, while she's contributing a larger percentage. For example, if the rent is $2000, he's paying 25% of his income ($80k) in rent, while she'd be paying about 44% of her $45k income. That seems like a significant difference and could be a point of contention. \n\nHowever, another angle is that moving into a new place can be stressful, and the author might be trying to keep it simple by splitting everything evenly. The girlfriend's friends think he's being unreasonable, which adds social pressure on both sides. The girlfriend might feel that her lower income means she shouldn't have to pay half, especially if the rent is a large part of her budget.\n\nIt's also important to consider cultural norms and the couple's specific situation. In some relationships, splitting 50/50 is expected regardless of income, while others adjust based on earnings. The author might not have considered the proportion of income each person is contributing, which could be why his girlfriend and her friends are upset. \n\nOn the other hand, if the apartment is already rented by the author and the girlfriend is moving in, some might argue that she should pay half to share the cost, especially if the space is being used equally. But if the author is already paying the full rent alone and then splitting with her, maybe she's not contributing to the initial cost. However, the question states that the author is asking her to cover half of everything from the start when they move in together, which suggests that the apartment will be shared from day one.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends' reactions indicate that they think the author is being unfair. Their perspective might be that with a significant income difference, the higher earner should contribute more. The author's stance could be seen as not accounting for their different financial situations, leading to an unequal burden.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether splitting 50/50 is fair given their income disparity. If fairness is determined by the proportion of each person's income, then the author's approach might not be fair, making him at fault. However, if the couple agrees that splitting equally is acceptable regardless of income, then he's not at fault. The girlfriend and her friends feel he's being unreasonable, so the answer might lean towards A (he's at fault) because he's not considering the income ratio in the split. But others might argue that 50/50 is standard and the girlfriend should adjust her expectations.\n"
