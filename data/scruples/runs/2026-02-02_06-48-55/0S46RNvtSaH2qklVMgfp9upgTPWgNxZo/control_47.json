      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The guy is 22, she's 23, they've been together for 1.5 years. He's renting a place by himself since he moved downtown for a job after graduating. She wants to move in with him and he's saying she should pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. The girl and her friends think he's being a douche because he makes $80k and she makes $45k.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. They're a couple, and moving in together often involves splitting costs. The key point here is the discrepancy in their incomes. The guy wants an equal split regardless of their earnings, while the girlfriend might feel that's unfair because he makes more. \n\nIn some relationships, splitting costs equally is standard, but others might split proportionally based on income. The author's request is 50/50, which is a common approach, but if their incomes are different, that could be a problem. Let me think if there's a right or wrong here. \n\nFinancial fairness in relationships is subjective. Some people believe in splitting 50/50 because they're a partner, others think the higher earner should contribute more. The author isn't wrong for having that expectation, especially if he's willing to live in a more expensive area for his job. But if the girlfriend can't afford half, then maybe that's an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends call him a douche, but that might be their opinion based on their own views. The author isn't forcing her to move in; he's setting a boundary that he's comfortable with. It's his place, so it's reasonable for him to want shared responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's making half his salary, paying 50% of the rent might be a larger financial burden for her. But that's a matter of negotiation between the couple. Since the author is the one who owns the place and is setting the terms, he might not be in the wrong. Unless there's some local custom or agreement that suggests otherwise. \n\nI should also consider if the 50/50 split is typical in their area. If moving in together is usually a shared expense regardless of income, then the author is fine. But if people expect the higher earner to cover more, then maybe. However, the question is about the author's right to set the terms. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to split costs 50/50. It's a personal choice and part of how he manages his finances. The girlfriend might have different expectations, but that doesn't make him wrong. They need to communicate and find a solution that works for both, but his stance isn't inherently wrong.\n"
