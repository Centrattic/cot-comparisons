I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that he's making $80k, she's making $45k, and her friends think he's being unreasonable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices around splitting costs when couples live together. Some people split things 50/50 regardless of income, while others adjust based on income disparity. The author is asking for equal splits, but his GF and her friends think he's being unfair.\n\nIncome differences can definitely affect how people split expenses. If one person earns significantly more, it's common for them to pay a larger share. But some might argue that once you're living together, it's a shared home and splitting equally is fair because it's shared responsibilities and space. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's covering half of the rent, utilities, and groceries. But given the income difference, she's paying about half of what he's paying in terms of absolute numbers. If the rent is, say, $2000 a month, he's asking for her to pay $1000, but she's making less than half his salary. That might be a stretch for her financially compared to him. \n\nOn the other hand, if they're both contributing equally to the household expenses, even if their incomes are different, that could be seen as fair because they're both sharing the same living space. But this depends on their individual financial situations. If the author is in a higher tax bracket or has other financial obligations, that might influence the perception of fairness.\n\nHer friends' opinion that he's a \"douche\" suggests that they think he's not being considerate of her lower income. It's possible that the author isn't taking her financial situation into account, expecting her to pay half regardless of her ability to do so. \n\nHowever, there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. Some couples do split things equally based on the idea that it's a shared home, while others adjust based on income. The key is communication and mutual agreement. The author might be in the wrong if he's rigidly sticking to 50/50 without considering the income gap, which could lead to financial strain on his partner. But if both parties agreed to this arrangement, it's their choice. However, since his GF and her friends find it unfair, it might indicate a potential issue in their relationship's financial dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance could be seen as not considering the income disparity, making him possibly in the wrong. But it's also a matter of personal values and what the couple agrees on. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the feedback from her friends, leaning towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) might be appropriate.\n"
