I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The situation is that he rents a place by himself, and when she wants to move in, he's asking her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a \"dick\" or a \"douche\" because his income is higher (80k vs her 45k). The user wants a yes or no answer (A/B) based on whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments in such situations. The author wants an equal split regardless of income, while the girlfriend argues that since he earns more, he should pay a larger share. The question is about fairness and societal expectations. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting expenses 50/50 can be seen as fair if both are contributing equally. However, some people argue that splitting based on income is more equitable. For example, if one person makes significantly more, they might pay a larger portion to account for their higher ability to pay. The girlfriend's friends' reactions suggest that in their view, expecting equal contributions regardless of income is unreasonable, hence the author being at fault.\n\nBut others might say that if the apartment is in the author's name, or if he's the one who initially paid for it, then expecting a 50/50 split when someone moves in is fair because it's contributing equally to a shared space. However, the author already has the apartment, so maybe it's not entirely fair to expect the other person to pay half. That could depend on whether the apartment was his before the move-in or if it's a new place they're both getting. The context says he rents by himself since he graduated and moved downtown for a job, so the apartment is his. If she moves in, he's sharing it. So maybe he should adjust the rent based on the fact that he's the one who secured the place and the existing lease. \n\nAnother angle is that utilities and groceries are things both people will use, so splitting those 50/50 makes sense. But rent is more complicated because it's tied to the lease. If the apartment was his, maybe she's not entitled to a full 50% off the rent. But if they're both living there, maybe he should split the rent. However, the fact that he's making more money might mean he can afford to pay more. \n\nThe question is whether expecting a 50/50 split is wrong when there's a significant income difference. If the author is in the wrong (A), it's because he's not considering their different earnings. If not (B), it's because splitting equally is fair for shared living expenses. The girlfriend's friends' opinion that he's a \"douche\" leans towards A, but maybe the author is justified in wanting equal contributions for the shared space. \n\nI need to recall common advice on splitting costs in relationships. Often, it's suggested that couples should split expenses based on their income (proportional to what they earn) if they're living together. So if the author makes more, he should pay a larger share. Therefore, wanting a 50/50 split regardless of income could be seen as unfair, making the author at fault (A). However, if the apartment is his and he's allowing her to move in, maybe he's already giving her a place to live for free, so expecting her to pay half is fair. \n\nBut given the significant income difference, the author might be expected to pay more than half of the rent. For example, maybe the rent is split based on their combined income. If the total rent is X, he pays (80k/(80k+45k)) * X, and she pays the remaining. But the author is asking for 50/50, which doesn't account for their income. So that could be the issue. Hence, the author might be in the wrong (A) because he's not considering their different earnings. \n\nOn the other hand, if they're just splitting everything equally because they're sharing the apartment, maybe 50/50 is fair. But the problem arises because of the income disparity. If the rent is high, and she can't afford half, maybe that's an issue. The author's stance might be seen as unfair if it's putting a financial burden on her. \n\nI think the key here is whether splitting based on income is expected. In many modern relationships, it's considered fair to adjust contributions according to income. Therefore, the author's insistence on 50/50 regardless of income could be seen as wrong. So the answer would be A. But I need to check if there's any nuance. For example, if the apartment was his before she moved in, he might have the right to set the terms. But if he's adjusting the rent because she's moving in, maybe 50/50 is fair. However, given the income difference, maybe he should adjust it. \n\nIn summary, the author's stance could be considered as being in the wrong (A) because he's not considering their different incomes, which is a common expectation in such scenarios. The girlfriend's friends' opinions support this, indicating that the author is being unreasonable by not adjusting the split to account for their earnings.\n"
