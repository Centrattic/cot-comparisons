I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend despite their differing incomes. The key points here are the income disparity: he makes $80k, she makes $45k. He's offering to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common norms around splitting costs when moving in together. Typically, splitting 50/50 is a common approach, especially if both parties are contributing to the household. However, when there's a significant income difference, some people argue that the higher earner should contribute more, especially if they have more financial flexibility. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The question hinges on whether expecting a 50/50 split is unreasonable given their incomes. Some might argue that since both are contributing to the shared living space, splitting equally is fair. Others might say that the higher earner should take on a larger share to account for the income gap. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends label him as a \"douche\" and \"dick,\" which suggests that in her social circle, splitting 50/50 when one makes significantly more is seen as unfair. However, cultural norms vary. In some contexts, splitting costs equally is expected regardless of income, while in others, it's adjusted based on earnings. \n\nI also need to consider the practical aspect. If the higher earner (M22) is paying more, the lower earner might feel the relationship is transactional. Conversely, if they split equally, M22 might be sacrificing less from his income. For example, $1000 rent split 50/50 would be 25% of her income versus 12.5% of his. That's a significant difference in percentage terms. So, from a financial burden perspective, it's a bigger hit for her. \n\nHowever, if the agreement is that both contribute equally to the household, regardless of income, that's a valid approach. The issue here is whether expecting a 50/50 split is fair when their incomes are so different. The girlfriend's perspective is that he should contribute more because he earns more. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the societal or relationship norms they apply. If the norm is to adjust contributions based on income, then he's in the wrong. If the norm is equal contribution regardless, then he's not. Given that the girlfriend's friends think he's being unreasonable, it's likely the former. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
