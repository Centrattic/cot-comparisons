I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. He's a male, 22, she's 23. They've been together 1.5 years. He lives alone and she wants to move in. He's offering to split rent, utilities, groceries equally. She argues that because he makes more (80k vs her 45k), he's being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Some couples split 50/50 regardless of income, others split based on income. The author is asking if he's wrong to expect 50/50.\n\nHis GF's friends think he's being a jerk, which adds social pressure. But is that necessarily right? The question is whether expecting equal split is wrong when there's a significant income difference.\n\nIn some relationships, splitting 50/50 is fair because it's about equality. But if one person's income is much higher, others might argue that the higher earner should pay more. However, the author might not want to create an imbalance in the relationship. \n\nThe key points here: the author's income is significantly higher. If they split costs equally, he's paying a proportionally smaller share (like 47% of income vs her 50%), which could be seen as unfair. On the other hand, the author might not want to take advantage of his higher income and prefer equal sharing for fairness. \n\nBut the girlfriend's argument is that since he makes more, he should contribute more. If they split 50/50, he's effectively paying less in terms of his earnings. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering their income disparity. However, others might say that splitting costs equally is fair as it's about shared responsibility, not income.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In some contexts, splitting by income is fairer, while in others, equal split is standard. The author's refusal to adjust the split based on income could be seen as not being considerate of their different financial situations. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong (A) because he's not considering the income difference, but others might say it's not wrong if they agreed to split equally. However, given the significant income gap, expecting equal split might be unreasonable.\n"
