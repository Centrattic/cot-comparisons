I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author makes $80k, while she makes $45k. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of relationships and financial splits. Generally, splitting 50-50 can be fair if both partners can afford it. But here, the income difference is significant. If she's earning less, expecting her to pay half might be unfair, especially if their expenses are the same. But the author's reasoning is that he's paying for the place himself now, so adding her would mean splitting. However, maybe a more equitable approach would consider their incomes. For example, splitting based on a percentage of their combined income. Since he makes more, he might take a larger share. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends also think he's being a jerk. That could indicate that in her social circle, 50-50 is the norm, but financial fairness might require adjustment. The key here is communication. The author should have discussed the split in a way that considers both their financial situations. By insisting on 50-50 without considering income disparity, he might be seen as not being considerate. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because a 50-50 split ignores their different earnings. It's about fairness, not just equal division. If she can only afford half due to lower income, that's one thing, but if her income is lower, expecting her to pay the same as someone with a higher income could be unfair. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
