She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since moving for his job, and she wants to move in. He proposed splitting rent, utilities, and groceries equally. She thinks he's being unreasonable because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also called him a douche for that.\n\nHmm. The key here is about splitting costs equally versus splitting based on income. The author is suggesting a 50/50 split regardless of their earnings. The girlfriend and her friends argue that since he earns more, he should contribute more. The question is whether the author is wrong for insisting on equal splits.\n\nI need to consider common views on this. Some people think splitting equally is fair because everyone gets equal use of the space. Others believe splitting based on income is fairer, as it accounts for each person's financial situation. The author's stance is a 50/50 split, but his income is significantly higher. His reasoning might be that they both use the apartment equally, so they should pay equally. However, others might see it as unfair if he can afford to pay more given his higher income.\n\nIn many relationships, couples might adjust contributions based on income, but there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The author's position isn't necessarily wrong, but it's a point of contention. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is advocating for equal splitting despite the income disparity, some might see that as not considering the financial balance. But others might support his approach. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks for the asshole's perspective. If the author is being unreasonable by not considering the income difference, then he's the asshole. But if splitting equally is a reasonable approach, then he's not. The answer depends on whether the community perceives splitting based on income as the fairer approach. In this case, the girlfriend's friends think he's in the wrong, but that's part of the scenario. The user wants a decision between A (Yes, author wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nI think the correct answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. Splitting equally is a common practice, and it's a matter of mutual agreement. However, the author could be seen as not being considerate of the income difference. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and there's a valid argument for both sides, the answer might be B. However, I need to check if the 50/50 split is unreasonable given the income gap. If he's making more, maybe expecting her to pay half is seen as unfair. But if they're both using the space equally, then it's a matter of personal values. \n\nSo, depending on cultural norms, but in many cases, expecting equal payment regardless of income is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the community here leans towards splitting based on income, then it's A. But since the answer should be based on general fairness, I think B is correct.\n"
