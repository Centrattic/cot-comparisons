      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy (M22) is renting a place by himself since he moved for a job. He's been with his girlfriend (F23) for 1.5 years. She wants to move in together, and he wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks this is a \"huge dick move\" because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nNow, to figure out if he's in the wrong. Splitting costs equally can be a fair approach, especially if they're sharing the space equally. However, income disparity might be a factor. If one person makes significantly more, maybe expecting a 50/50 split could be seen as unfair. But the guy is not asking her to pay more than her share; he's just splitting it down the middle regardless of income. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that splitting costs equally isn't fair if one person's income is much lower. But this depends on their agreement and what they're comfortable with. The guy might have a mortgage or rent payment that he's already managing, and adding a roommate would mean splitting the cost. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her lower income makes it harder for her to contribute half. But if they're in a committed relationship, maybe the expectation is that they share expenses equally regardless of income. However, others might think that splitting based on income is more equitable. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms and common practices. In many relationships, splitting costs 50/50 is standard unless there's a different agreement. But if one person is earning more, they might take on a larger share voluntarily. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is asking for her to pay half, not more. So if both are sharing the home equally, a 50/50 split could be fair. The girlfriend's friends' opinions might be biased, but that's their perspective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether income is a factor they both agree to consider. If they're splitting based on usage and space, 50/50 makes sense. But if income is a factor, then maybe it's different. However, the author isn't adjusting based on income; he's just splitting equally. \n\nIn many cases, splitting costs equally is standard in relationships, especially when moving in together. The girlfriend's friends might think he's being unfair, but unless there's a specific reason for unequal splits, 50/50 is often acceptable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
