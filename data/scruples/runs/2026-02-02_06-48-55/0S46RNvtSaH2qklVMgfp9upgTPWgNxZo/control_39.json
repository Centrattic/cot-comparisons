      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is male, 22, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since moving downtown for a job last June. When she suggested moving in together, he said she should cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unfair because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. The user wants to know if AITA (Am I the Asshole).\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices around splitting costs in a shared living situation. Usually, splitting 50-50 is standard, but there are cases where some people adjust based on income. The author's stance is to split everything equally, regardless of income. The girlfriend argues that since he earns more, he should pay a larger share. Her friends agree with her, so there's a social pressure angle here.\n\nI should think about whether income differences typically affect how costs are split. Some people might believe that the higher earner should contribute more, especially if one partner is paying for other expenses like healthcare or if there's a significant income gap. In this case, the author's income is almost double hers. If they split all costs equally, maybe the author is expected to pay a larger portion because he can afford it more.\n\nHowever, the author's point is that sharing a home is a joint responsibility, so splitting 50-50 is fair. It depends on their individual values and agreements. If they hadn't discussed it beforehand, maybe the author's approach is reasonable. But since the girlfriend feels it's unfair given their income disparity, and her friends back her up, there's a conflict here.\n\nThe key factors are: communication, prior expectations, and the reasonableness of the 50-50 split given their financial situation. If the author had considered her lower income and adjusted accordingly, maybe he would be in the right. But if he's sticking to 50-50 without considering their income difference, he might be seen as not being considerate enough.\n\nAlso, cultural norms play a role. In some cultures, splitting costs equally is standard regardless of income, while others adjust based on earnings. The answer might hinge on whether the 50-50 split is seen as fair when one person's income is significantly higher. If the girlfriend's friends think he's being a \"douche,\" that suggests that in their social circle, adjusting for income is the norm, which could make the author the asshole in this scenario.\n\nBut another angle is that splitting costs 50-50 is a common practice, and unless there's a prior agreement to adjust, the author isn't wrong. However, given that their incomes are quite different, maybe the author should be more flexible. The problem is that the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is wrong. If the author is being rigid without considering her perspective, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer could swing either way. If the community typically adjusts for income differences, then A. If 50-50 is standard regardless, then B. Given that the girlfriend's friends and she think he's being unfair, and given the significant income gap, maybe A is the answer. However, if the author had clearly communicated that it's 50-50 before moving in, maybe not. But the question is about wanting to split 50-50 when moving in. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author is in the wrong because of their income disparity. So the answer is A.\n"
