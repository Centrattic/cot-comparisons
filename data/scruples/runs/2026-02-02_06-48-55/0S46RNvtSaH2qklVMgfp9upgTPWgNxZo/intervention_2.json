I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. The author is a guy in his early 20s, and his girlfriend is a year older. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since he moved downtown for a job after graduating. The girlfriend wants to move in together, and he's saying she needs to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks he's being unfair because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is splitting costs equally regardless of income. The author's position is 50/50, but their incomes are different. The girlfriend might feel that since he makes more, he should pay a larger share. But the author might think that moving in together is a shared responsibility, so splitting costs equally is fair. \n\nBut wait, in relationships, splitting costs often depends on individual circumstances. If both are contributing to household expenses, maybe splitting equally is okay. However, if one's income is significantly higher, expecting equal contribution might not be fair. For example, if he makes twice as much, maybe he can afford to pay a larger portion. The girlfriend's friends think he's being a jerk, which suggests that maybe others in her social circle believe the split should be based on income.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes people in relationships prefer to split things 50/50 regardless of income because they see it as a partnership where both are contributing equally to the household, even if their earnings differ. The author might not want to feel like he's subsidizing her living costs, especially if he's paying rent alone now. But once she moves in, she's joining the household, so expecting her to split everything equally might be reasonable from his perspective. However, considering their income disparity, maybe a different split would be more equitable. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the expectation is based on income, then wanting 50/50 might be seen as unfair. However, if the expectation is based on equal contribution to the household, then maybe not. It's a bit of a grey area. But given that their incomes are quite different, maybe the author is in the right to want a 50/50 split because he's already paying for the place alone and wants to share the burden equally. Alternatively, maybe he's in the wrong because he's not considering the income difference. \n\nI think the key here is that in many relationships, splitting expenses based on income is more common. If he's making significantly more, it's reasonable for her to expect a different arrangement. But if he's okay with her paying half, maybe it's about mutual agreement. The fact that her friends think he's being a jerk might indicate that the community's perspective is that income should be considered. So perhaps the author is in the wrong here. But I'm a bit torn because it's subjective. However, given the income difference, expecting equal payment might not be fair. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
