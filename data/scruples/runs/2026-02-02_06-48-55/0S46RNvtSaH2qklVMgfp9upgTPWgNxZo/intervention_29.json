I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 22, the girl is 23. They've been together a year and a half. The guy is paying for a place alone since moving downtown for his job. His salary is $80k, hers is $45k. She wants to move in together, and he wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk because of their income difference.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is, is the author in the wrong? Answer A for yes, B for no.\n\nHmm. Well, splitting costs 50/50 regardless of income is a common point of contention. The guy's argument is that he's making more, so he might expect to pay more. But he's asking for equal split. The girl's side is that since he earns more, she should pay less. Her friends back her up, implying he's being unfair.\n\nIn relationships, splitting expenses can be a sensitive topic. Generally, people might expect that if there's a significant income disparity, the higher earner might contribute more, especially if they're living together. The guy is asking for 50/50, which could be seen as not considering their different financial situations. On the other hand, some might argue that splitting equally is fair because they both live in the home equally and should share the burden. But given their incomes, if the guy makes more, it's reasonable to expect he might take on a larger share. So, the author's stance could be seen as not being fair because he's not adjusting the split based on their earnings. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
