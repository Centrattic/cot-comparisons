I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, they've been together 1.5 years. He rents a place alone since moving for a job, and now she wants to move in. He's saying she should cover half the rent, utilities, groceries. She's arguing against it because his income is higher (80k vs her 45k). Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. Let's break it down. When couples move in together, splitting costs equally isn't always proportional to income. Some argue that the higher earner should contribute more, especially if the other's income is significantly lower. Here, his salary is almost double hers. So expecting her to pay half might not be fair from her perspective. She's bringing up her lower income as a reason, which makes sense. If they split 50/50, she might be paying a larger percentage of her income compared to him. That could be burdensome for her.\n\nBut on the other hand, the guy is paying rent for a place he already has. If she moves in, it's possible the rent might go up, but he's still the one who owns the lease. Maybe he's being reasonable in his expectation. However, considering the income disparity, maybe a 50/50 split isn't the most equitable approach. Maybe a different arrangement, like splitting based on income or other factors, would be better. The fact that her friends think he's a jerk suggests that she feels this is unfair, and if the relationship is about mutual respect, he might be overstepping by not considering her financial situation. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong by insisting on an equal split without considering their different earnings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
