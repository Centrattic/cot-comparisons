      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. Let me break this down. The author is a 22-year-old male, and the girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. The author is renting a place by himself since moving downtown for a job last June. Now the girlfriend wants to move in, and he's insisting she pays half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k, and her friends called him a douche.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting expenses. Usually, when couples live together, they split the costs 50/50 unless there's a different arrangement they agree on. The author is asking for half, which is standard. However, the income disparity is significant. The author earns almost double the girlfriend. So, the question is, does income matter in splitting living costs? \n\nIn some relationships, people adjust based on income. For example, if one person earns more, they might take a larger share of expenses. But the author isn't asking for that; he's sticking to 50/50 regardless of income. The girlfriend and her friends see this as unfair because he's the higher earner. They might expect him to contribute more, especially if the apartment was already his to begin with. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is the one who already rented the place might be a factor. If he's the one who had to initially cover the rent, moving in a partner might mean he's expecting her to help with the same amount. But if the apartment is already in his name and he's paying the full rent, adding someone and splitting it 50/50 could be seen as the right approach. However, the girlfriend might feel that since he's making more, she shouldn't have to pay the same percentage. \n\nAnother angle is the purpose of moving in together. If the apartment was already his, maybe the rent didn't increase, and she's just splitting existing costs. But if the rent went up because they moved in together, then splitting equally makes sense. The details here are a bit unclear. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting equally is fair if both are contributing the same amount, but when there's a significant income difference, it might not feel fair to the lower earner. However, splitting by income could complicate things. For example, if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, splitting based on income would mean he pays more. But the author isn't doing that. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends reacting negatively suggests that in her social circle, income is a factor. The author's stance is standard, but in their context, it's causing friction because of the income gap. The question is whether the author's approach is wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, people don't split by income, especially in shared living. Friends might have different opinions, but the key is mutual agreement. The author isn't forcing her; he's setting a condition. If she's uncomfortable, maybe the issue is communication. However, the author's request isn't unreasonable on the surface. But considering the income difference, the girlfriend might feel the split isn't fair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we go strictly by the 50/50 split being standard, then no. But considering the income disparity and the fact that the apartment was his, maybe the author isn't wrong, but there's room for discussion. However, the girlfriend's friends' reaction and her own perspective indicate that the split might be perceived as unfair. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because splitting costs equally is typical unless otherwise negotiated. However, the context of income and the existing apartment might make it seem less fair. But without more info, the standard approach is 50/50. So the answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted because income could affect fairness. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, and unless there's an agreement to adjust for income, he's not.\n"
