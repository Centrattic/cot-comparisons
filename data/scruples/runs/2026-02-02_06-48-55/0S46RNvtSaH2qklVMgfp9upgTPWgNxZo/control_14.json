I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The author is male, 22, and she's 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He's renting a place by himself since moving downtown for a job, and she wants to move in. He's asking her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he's making $80k and she's making $45k. Her friends also think he's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. A 50/50 split is common, but sometimes couples adjust based on income. The author's higher income is a factor here. If they are in a committed relationship, some might argue that splitting costs based on income is fairer. But others might say that splitting equally is standard unless agreed otherwise.\n\nThe author's reasoning is to split everything 50/50, but his girlfriend and her friends see that as unfair given the income disparity. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting equal splitting despite their different earnings.\n\nIn some cultures or situations, splitting costs equally is the norm regardless of income. However, others might see it as more equitable to adjust contributions based on each person's ability to pay. Since the author earns more, expecting her to pay half might be seen as not considering her lower income. \n\nBut then, the author is in a position where he's already paying for the place alone. If she moves in, he's reducing his living space, so maybe he expects her to contribute equally. However, if their incomes are different, maybe a different split (like a percentage based on income) would be fairer. \n\nI think the key here is that while 50/50 is a common approach, it's not the only way, and considering income differences can be a fairer approach. Since the author is making almost double her income, expecting her to pay half might be seen as not taking into account their different financial situations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible. So the answer would be A.\n"
