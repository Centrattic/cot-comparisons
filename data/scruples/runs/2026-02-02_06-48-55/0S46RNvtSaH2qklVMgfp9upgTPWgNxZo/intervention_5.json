      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split of living costs with his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is M22, and his girlfriend is F23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He moved into a place alone after graduating and getting a job downtown. Now, she wants to move in together. He's offering a 50/50 split on rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm, the key point here is the split of expenses based on income. Typically, when couples split costs, it's common to divide them based on each person's share of the combined income. For example, if one person makes more, they might cover a larger portion. However, some people prefer an equal split regardless of income, thinking it's fair because they both live in the same space and use the same utilities.\n\nThe author is asking if he's at fault. The girlfriend and her friends argue that he's being unfair because he earns more. The question is whether splitting 50/50 is wrong when there's a significant income disparity. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both are sharing the home equally, splitting 50/50 might be seen as fair. But if one person is contributing more to the household overall, maybe the higher earner should cover more. However, some people might argue that splitting equally is about equality of living conditions, not income. \n\nBut in this case, the author is the one who owns the place. If he's inviting her to move in, he might be expected to adjust the split based on his higher income. However, it's also about personal boundaries. He might not be comfortable asking her to move in without her contributing her fair share. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong, saying it's a \"huge dick move\" and her friends agree. That suggests that in her social circle, splitting equally isn't the norm when there's a big income difference. But that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. It's more about differing opinions on what's fair.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms or what the couple agrees upon. Since they haven't discussed it yet, maybe the issue is communication. The author's stance is reasonable if he's firm on equal sharing, but if the girlfriend expects a split based on income, he's not considering her perspective. \n\nHowever, wanting to split 50/50 isn't inherently wrong. It's a common approach, especially in newer relationships. But if the girlfriend feels it's unfair given their incomes, that's a valid concern too. The problem is that they haven't found a middle ground yet. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to split equally. It's a matter of differing views on fairness. But maybe he should be open to negotiation instead of insisting on 50/50 if it's causing conflict. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
