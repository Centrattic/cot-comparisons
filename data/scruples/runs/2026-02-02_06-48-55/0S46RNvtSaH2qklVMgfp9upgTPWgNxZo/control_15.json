She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since moving downtown for a job, and she wants to move in. He's saying he wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Typically, some people split expenses equally regardless of income, while others adjust based on income disparities. The key point here is the difference in their salaries. He makes significantly more than her. If they split everything 50/50, she might be contributing a larger percentage of her income compared to his. For example, if the rent is $2000, he's paying 25% of his income, while she's paying around 44%. That's a big difference and could be seen as unfair from her perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is that he wants to split the costs equally. He might believe that since they're living together, it's fair to share the burden equally. However, in relationships where there's a significant income disparity, splitting based on income can be more equitable. The question is whether wanting a strict 50/50 split is \"in the wrong.\"\n\nAnother angle is that the author is living in a more expensive area (downtown) which might have higher rent. If she moves in, she's essentially moving to a more expensive place than she might have otherwise chosen. That could also affect her financial situation more. \n\nHer friends' reactions are that he's a douche, which is subjective, but it's common for people to adjust splitting costs based on income. The author might not be considering the relative financial impact on his girlfriend. So, the argument is that wanting equal splits regardless of income could be seen as unfair because it doesn't account for the financial strain on both parties. \n\nTherefore, the author's approach might not be in the wrong, but the perception is that he is being unfair because he's not considering the income difference. The answer depends on whether the question is about the fairness based on income or just equal sharing. Since the girlfriend and her friends think he's wrong, and given the income disparity, the author might be in the wrong because he's not accounting for the financial imbalance. So the answer would be A.\n"
