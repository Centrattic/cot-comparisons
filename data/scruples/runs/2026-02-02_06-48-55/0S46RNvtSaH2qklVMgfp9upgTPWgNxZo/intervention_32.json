I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend (F23). The key points here are their income difference and the cultural norms around splitting costs.\n\nFirst, the author makes $80k, and the GF makes $45k. He wants to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. The GF and her friends think he's being unreasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting a 50/50 split despite the income disparity.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs equally can be a point of contention when there's a significant income difference. Some argue that higher earners should contribute more to shared expenses, especially if the lower earner is a student or has other financial commitments. Others believe that a 50/50 split is fair if both parties are contributing equally to the household, regardless of income. \n\nHowever, the author's stance here is that because he's paying half, he's being fair. But if they move in together, the rent and utilities would be fixed costs. If the author is making more, expecting the GF to pay half regardless of her income might be seen as not considering the financial balance. For example, if the rent is $2000, the author is making $80k (which is about $6666/month) and the GF is making $45k (about $3750/month). Splitting $2000 50/50 would require the GF to spend a larger portion of her income on rent compared to the author. That could be a burden, especially if she's also covering other expenses.\n\nMoreover, the GF's friends' reaction suggests that there's a societal expectation that the higher earner should contribute more. While this isn't a universal standard, it's a common viewpoint in many cultures. The author's insistence on equal splitting without considering income differences might be seen as not being considerate of their financial realities.\n\nAnother angle is that splitting costs equally could be fair if both are contributing equally to the household in other ways, like time or other responsibilities. But the main issue here is the monetary split. Since the author's income is significantly higher, expecting a 50/50 split might not be fair in terms of proportional contribution. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once you're in a relationship, the expectation is to share expenses equally regardless of income, especially if both are contributing to shared living. But given the income difference, the 50/50 split could be more of a financial strain on the lower earner. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's approach might not take into account the proportional contribution based on income, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
