      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 22-year-old male who's been dating his girlfriend for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since moving downtown for a job last June. She wants to move in together, and he's suggesting splitting rent, utilities, and groceries equally. She took offense, saying he makes $80k and she makes $45k, and her friends called him a douche. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nHmm, splitting costs 50/50 can be a common approach, but it might not account for differences in income. The author's higher income compared to his girlfriend's might be a point of contention. If they're splitting everything equally regardless of income, maybe she feels it's unfair because he's contributing more in terms of percentage of his income. For example, if rent is $2000, he's paying $1000 which is 12.5% of his income, while she's paying $1000 which is about 22% of hers. That could be a valid concern.\n\nBut on the other hand, when two people live together, it's common to split expenses equally especially if they're both contributing to the household. The author might be thinking that since they're sharing the space and resources, the costs should be shared equally. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that because he earns more, maybe he should pay a larger share.\n\nThe fact that her friends said he's being a douche suggests that in her social circle, splitting based on income is expected. But different people have different views on this. Some couples split expenses equally regardless of income, others split proportionally. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on their agreement and expectations. If they hadn't discussed it beforehand and he just proposed 50/50 without considering the income disparity, maybe he's not wrong, but perhaps he should be more flexible. However, if they're in a committed relationship and moving in together, considering each other's financial situations could be important for fairness.\n\nI think the key here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong for suggesting a 50/50 split as a standard approach, but the girlfriend's reaction points to a possible need to adjust based on income. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but he should consider adjusting the split to account for their earnings differences. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and there's no inherent rule that 50/50 is always wrong, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
