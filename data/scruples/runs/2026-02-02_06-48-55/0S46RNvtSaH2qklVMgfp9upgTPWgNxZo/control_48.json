I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend is in the wrong. The main factors here are their incomes and the social norms around splitting expenses in a relationship.\n\nThe guy is making $80k a year, and the girl is making $45k. He's asking her to cover half of rent, utilities, and groceries. His friends, including the girlfriend's friends, are saying he's being unreasonable. The question is whether splitting 50/50 is fair given their income disparity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices. In many relationships, couples split expenses based on their income. So if one person makes significantly more, they might cover a larger share. But there's also the idea that splitting 50/50 is equal, regardless of income. However, if one person can't afford half due to lower income, that could cause issues.\n\nThe guy's stance is that he wants equal contribution. The girl and her friends think he's being unfair because of the income difference. The key here is whether it's reasonable to expect someone with a lower income to pay half. If the total cost is, say, $2000 a month, half would be $1000. If his rent is $1500, then half would be $750 each, but the girl's $45k might not cover that, especially with other expenses. \n\nBut the guy's argument is about fairness in splitting the cost equally. The problem arises if the girl can't afford her half. However, the question is if he's in the wrong for wanting 50/50. Socially, some people might say the higher earner should contribute more. Others might say equal split is fair regardless. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the 50/50 split is feasible for both parties. If the girl can't afford half, then the guy's request is unreasonable. But if the split is feasible, then it's not. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's friends are against it, maybe there's a social norm that higher earners should contribute more. But the guy's reasoning is that it's fair to split equally. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. If the couple can agree on 50/50 and both can afford it, then it's not wrong. But if the girl can't afford it and he's insisting, that's where the problem is. Since the girlfriend's friends think he's wrong, it suggests that in their social circle, the income disparity makes 50/50 unfair. But without knowing the actual numbers (like how much rent is), it's hard to say. \n\nAssuming the rent is high enough that her $45k can't cover half, then he's wrong. But if it's within her means, he's not. Since the problem states that she's making 45k and he's making 80k, and assuming that the cost to split is a significant portion of her income, then he's being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong). But if the split is feasible, then B. However, the question is presented in the context of her friends calling him a douche, implying that the split isn't feasible. So the answer is A.\n"
