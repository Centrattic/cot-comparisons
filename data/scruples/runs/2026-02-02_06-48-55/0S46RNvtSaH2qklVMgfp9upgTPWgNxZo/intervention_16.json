I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The man is 22, making $80k, and the woman is 23, making $45k. He's renting alone and wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries if they move in together.\n\nFirst, the salary difference is significant. He earns almost double her income. Splitting costs 50/50 in this case might not be fair because their incomes aren't equal. People often argue that splitting costs equally isn't fair if one person earns more. The girlfriend's friends calling him a \"douche\" and a \"dick\" suggests that others think he's being unreasonable, which could indicate that his stance isn't the norm. \n\nHowever, the man might feel that since he's covering the rent alone now, splitting equally would be fair. But considering their income disparity, expecting her to contribute 50% could be a heavy burden on her. Maybe splitting based on income would be more equitable. For example, he could cover a larger portion since he earns more. \n\nAlso, relationships involve compromise. The man wants to save money by having her help with costs, but he might need to be understanding of her financial situation. If she can't afford half, it could cause strain. The key here is whether the split is equitable based on their earnings. \n\nIn many cases, people adjust contributions based on income. So expecting a 50/50 split when their incomes are different might be unfair. The author's approach doesn't consider their respective financial capabilities, which could make him wrong. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
