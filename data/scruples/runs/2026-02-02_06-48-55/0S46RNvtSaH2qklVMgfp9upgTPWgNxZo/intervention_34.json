I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend when she makes less money. The girlfriend earns around $45k, and he makes $80k. She and her friends think he's being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on splitting costs in relationships. In many cases, people split expenses equally if they're living together, regardless of income, because the space and utilities are shared. But others argue that higher earners should contribute more, especially if the lower earner is saving or planning for something else.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they're sharing the same place, splitting costs 50/50 is fair. The girlfriend might feel that since he earns more, he should pay a larger share. Her friends support her view, which adds to the pressure. But is the author wrong? \n\nIt's subjective. Some might say fairness is about equal sharing of costs since both are using the same resources. Others might argue that splitting based on income is fairer. The key here is whether the situation is about equal contribution or proportional contribution. Since the author is setting a condition (50/50) for her moving in, and she's not happy with it, the question is whether that condition is unreasonable. \n\nGiven that the author is asking for advice, the community might look at both sides. However, if the girlfriend is okay with paying half despite the income difference, it's her choice. But the author is being asked if he's wrong. If he's not making her pay more despite his higher income, some might see that as not considering the income disparity. However, others might support equal split as fair. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the \"wrong\" is determined by societal norms. In many cultures, splitting costs equally is common unless there's a significant disparity or one person is in a financial hardship. Here, $80k vs. $45k isn't extreme, but it's a noticeable difference. The girlfriend's friends calling him a \"douche\" suggests they think he should be more flexible. \n\nBut the author isn't asking her to pay less; he's setting the condition upfront. If she doesn't agree, she doesn't have to move in. However, the perception is that he's being unfair. The answer might lean towards him being in the wrong if the community values adjusting for income differences. Alternatively, if equal split is the norm, he's not wrong. \n\nI think the answer here depends on the perspective. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I need to be careful. The key point is that wanting to split equally isn't inherently wrong, but if the higher earner is expected to contribute more, then the author is wrong. \n\nIn many AITA threads, people often suggest that splitting based on income is fair, so the author might be in the wrong for not proposing a different split. Therefore, the answer could be A. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a tricky one.\n"
