I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. The guy is 22, making $80k, and the girlfriend is 23, making $45k. He's asking her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in relationships. Splitting costs equally can be fair if both partners have similar incomes, but when there's a significant income difference, it might not be fair. The guy earns almost double what she does. So, expecting her to pay half, especially for rent and utilities, which are fixed costs, might not be equitable. \n\nIn many relationships, people adjust their contributions based on income. For example, the higher earner might pay a larger share. The guy's stance could be seen as not considering their different financial situations. If both pay 50%, the girlfriend would be contributing a larger percentage of her income compared to his. That might create an imbalance, leading to resentment.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends also think he's in the wrong, which adds to the social pressure. But friends' opinions can sometimes be biased. However, the key issue here is about fairness based on income. \n\nAnother angle is the intention. The guy wants to move in together, which is a big step, and setting up financial expectations is important. However, insisting on a 50/50 split without considering income disparity could be seen as inflexible. Maybe a different ratio, like 60/40, might be more balanced.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, splitting everything equally is standard regardless of income. But in others, adjusting based on earnings is more common. Since the user didn't specify cultural context, it's safer to assume a general approach where income is a factor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's demand for a 50/50 split despite a significant income difference might not be fair. The girlfriend's contribution would take up more of her income, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not considering their differing financial situations.\n"
