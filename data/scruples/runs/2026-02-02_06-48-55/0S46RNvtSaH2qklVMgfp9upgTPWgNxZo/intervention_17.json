I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about splitting living costs 50/50 when the author makes $80k and the girlfriend makes $45k. The girlfriend and her friends think the author is being unreasonable by wanting her to pay half everything. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to split costs equally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common norms around splitting expenses. I've heard that some couples split expenses equally regardless of income, while others go by percentage. If both can afford it, maybe 50/50 is fair. But if one's income is significantly lower, maybe splitting equally is unfair because the lower earner is contributing a larger portion of their income.\n\nIn this case, the author makes $80k, and the girlfriend makes $45k. Let's say the rent is, for example, $2000 a month. If they split 50/50, each pays $1000. The author's share would be 1.25% of their income, while the girlfriend's would be about 2.22%. That's a bigger chunk for her. So maybe the author is being a bit insensitive here because he's earning more and could cover a larger portion without it affecting him as much.\n\nBut wait, the author is renting the place by himself. If the girlfriend moves in, it's a shared expense. But maybe the author should consider their respective abilities to pay. If the rent is, say, $2000, and the author was already paying that alone, then adding the girlfriend paying half might be fair if the apartment is bigger or they split utilities. But if the apartment size doesn't change much, maybe the author could absorb a larger share. \n\nAlso, cultural norms vary. Some people think 50/50 is fair regardless of income, others think it should be proportional. The girlfriend's friends think the author is a douche, which might indicate that in their social circle, income-based splitting is more common.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they both benefit equally from living together, so splitting costs equally makes sense. But if the girlfriend is contributing less in income, maybe she's contributing more in other ways, like chores or time. But the question is about financial responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author is being reasonable because the apartment was his before, and now splitting makes sense. But if their incomes are different, the financial burden isn't equal. So the author might be in the wrong by not considering their different financial situations.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is making significantly more money and expects the same financial contribution, which could be a larger financial strain on the lower earner. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not proposing a more proportional split. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
