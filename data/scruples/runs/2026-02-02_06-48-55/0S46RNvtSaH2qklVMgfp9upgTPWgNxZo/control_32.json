      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split in living costs. The situation is that the guy (M22) makes 80k a year and the girl (F23) makes 45k. He's renting alone, and she wants to move in. He says she should pay half rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. A 50/50 split is a common approach, but income disparities can affect fairness. If one person makes significantly more, maybe they should pay a larger share. However, the guy might be thinking about equal responsibility or not wanting to subsidize her living expenses. \n\nThe guy's reasoning could be based on the idea that both should contribute equally to household expenses regardless of income. But income differences can lead to different financial burdens. For example, if he's making more, maybe he's in a higher tax bracket, so paying half the rent might be less impactful on his budget compared to hers. Alternatively, if they're in the same city, maybe the rent is a big chunk of either's income. \n\nThe girl's reaction might stem from feeling that her lower income makes a 50/50 split unfair to her. Her friends backing her up suggests that there's a cultural or social norm where splitting based on income is expected. However, in some relationships, people prefer equal splits as a way to share the responsibility equally, regardless of income.\n\nI should also consider the context: they're in a long-term relationship (1.5 years) and moving in together. Financial expectations can vary. If they're committed, maybe the higher earner is willing to pay more to support the relationship. But if they're just starting to live together, setting boundaries is important. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the guy's asking for 50/50 isn't just about money but about wanting her to take responsibility equally. However, if her income is lower, she might have a harder time meeting that split. The key here is whether the split is equitable. If they're splitting everything 50/50, but one's income is twice the other, maybe the lower earner is paying a larger percentage of their income. \n\nIn terms of fairness, a 50/50 split isn't always fair if the incomes are uneven. A better approach might be to split based on income proportion. For example, if he makes 80k and she 45k, total is 125k. His share would be 64%, hers 36%. So if the total costs are, say, $2000/month, he pays $1280, she $720. But the author isn't proposing that. He wants 50/50 regardless of income.\n\nSo, maybe the author is being unfair because he's not considering the income difference. The girl's friends might think so because they see the income disparity and think she's being asked to pay a larger portion of her income. On the other hand, the author might think that splitting equally is fair because they live together and share expenses. \n\nBut in many relationships, especially when one person earns significantly more, it's common to adjust contributions based on income. So the author's stance might be seen as not considering the financial realities of the other person. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not being flexible and for expecting an equal split despite the income difference. However, if they both agree that a 50/50 split works for them financially, then it's their choice. But the girl's reaction indicates that she feels it's unfair given their incomes. \n\nSo the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the 50/50 split doesn't account for the income disparity, potentially placing a higher relative burden on the lower earner. Alternatively, if the couple is okay with the split despite the income difference, maybe it's not wrong. But given the context and the reactions of her friends, it's likely that the author isn't considering the fairness in terms of income, making him the AITA.\n"
