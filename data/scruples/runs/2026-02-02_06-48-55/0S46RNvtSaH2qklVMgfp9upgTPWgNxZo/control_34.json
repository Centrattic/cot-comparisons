I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting living costs 50/50 when the guy makes $80k and the girl makes $45k.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when roommates are not in a relationship. Typically, roommates split expenses equally regardless of income. But when it's a couple, things can get more complicated. The guy wants a 50/50 split, but his girlfriend and her friends think it's unfair given the income disparity. \n\nThe guy's reasoning is that it's standard to split costs equally. However, the girlfriend might feel that since he earns more, he should contribute a larger share. The key here is whether splitting 50/50 is reasonable when their incomes are different. \n\nSome might argue that couples can choose to split expenses based on income, especially if they're in a long-term relationship. Others might say that splitting equally is fair because they're a couple and should be sharing expenses regardless of individual earnings. The girlfriend's friends labeling the guy as a \"douche\" suggests they think he's being unfair, possibly because he's not adjusting the split based on income. \n\nBut another angle is that the guy is just applying the standard roommate model to a romantic relationship. Maybe he expects them to be more of roommates rather than partners sharing financial responsibilities. The issue here is differing expectations. The guy might not see income as a factor, while the girl does. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? If the relationship is based on the idea of sharing equally as roommates, then no. But if the relationship is more about mutual support where higher earners contribute more, then he might be in the wrong. However, there's no universal right or wrong here. It's more about personal expectations and communication. The guy didn't necessarily do anything wrong, but he might need to discuss and adjust based on their mutual agreement. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether splitting equally is acceptable when incomes differ. Since the girlfriend and her friends see it as unfair, but the guy's stance is a common approach, it's a matter of differing viewpoints. The guy isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might need to be flexible. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong, but it's a situational judgment.\n"
