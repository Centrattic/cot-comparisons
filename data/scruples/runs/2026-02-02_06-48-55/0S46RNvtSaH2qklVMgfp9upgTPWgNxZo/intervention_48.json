I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. The situation is that the author (M22) and his girlfriend (F23) have been together for 1.5 years. He rents alone and got a job downtown, so he's in a place by himself. His girlfriend wants to move in together, and he's asking her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks he's being unfair because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. They want a yes or no answer, A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around splitting costs in a relationship. Typically, there's a debate about whether splitting 50/50 is fair when incomes are unequal. Some people argue that the person with the higher income should contribute more, while others believe that splitting equally is fair because both are using the same space and resources. \n\nIn this case, the author is asking for a 50/50 split despite making significantly more. His girlfriend's lower income might make half of the rent and utilities a larger financial burden for her. If they're moving in together, the expenses are shared, so contributing based on income might be more equitable. However, the author's reasoning could be that they're both living in the same place, so splitting equally is fair regardless of income. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends' reaction is also a point. If they think he's being unreasonable, that might indicate a cultural or social norm where splitting based on income is expected. But it's possible that the author's perspective is also valid if they agree that splitting equally is okay for both parties. \n\nThe key here is that fairness can be subjective. If they can't agree, the problem isn't just about who's right but about communication and mutual agreement. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong if both parties are okay with it, but since the girlfriend is uncomfortable and her friends support her view, it might mean the author is not considering her financial situation adequately. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If fairness is based on income, then yes, he might be. If fairness is about equal contribution regardless of income, then no. But since the girlfriend is struggling more with half the cost, the author might not be considering her perspective enough. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not adjusting the split to account for their differing incomes, which creates an unequal financial burden.\n"
