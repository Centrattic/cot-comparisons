I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 is in the wrong. The guy (M22) is making $80k, and his girlfriend (F23) is making $45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Traditionally, some couples split everything evenly, others split based on income. The guy's stance is 50/50 regardless of income. The girlfriend's argument is that since he earns more, she should pay less. Her friends agree with her, so maybe there's a cultural norm here.\n\nBut why would the guy want 50/50? Maybe he thinks it's fair since they both live in the space equally. But income disparity might make it harder for her to afford half. If her income is lower, paying half the rent could take up a bigger portion of her budget. For example, if rent is $2000, she pays $1000, which is like 22% of her $45k (assuming $1000 is 22% of 45k, which is roughly accurate). For him, $1000 is 12.5% of his $80k. That's a bigger financial burden for her relative to her income. That might be why she and her friends see it as unfair.\n\nAlso, maybe there's an expectation in relationships that partners support each other, and splitting 50/50 could be seen as not accounting for differing financial situations. The guy might not realize how the split affects her. So, he's in the wrong because he's not considering their different financial capacities. Therefore, answer A.\n"
