I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years. He lives alone and earns $80k, while she makes $45k. He's open to moving in together but wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk because of the income disparity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Usually, it's either 50/50 regardless of income or based on each person's income. The key here is the significant difference in their earnings. He's making almost double hers. If they split everything 50/50, she's contributing a larger percentage of her income, which might be unfair to her.\n\nBut some people argue that in a relationship, you should split things equally because it's a shared home. However, others believe that splitting based on income is more equitable. The girlfriend and her friends are on the side that the author is being unfair because his higher income means he can contribute more without it being a burden. \n\nThe question is whether wanting a 50/50 split is unreasonable. If the author is making more, maybe he should offer to pay a larger share. The fact that she's being asked to cover half of the rent and other costs might mean she's paying a bigger chunk of her income, which could be seen as unfair. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because not considering her financial situation. But then again, some might say that the couple should agree on terms that work for both, and he's not wrong for proposing a 50/50 split. However, given the income disparity, the 50/50 approach might not be fair to her. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not accounting for their different earnings.\n"
