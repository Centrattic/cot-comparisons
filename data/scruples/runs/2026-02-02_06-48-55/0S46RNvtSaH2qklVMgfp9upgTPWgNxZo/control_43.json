      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself after graduating and moving downtown for a job. Now she wants to move in, and he's suggesting splitting rent, utilities, and groceries equally. But she's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's typical in such situations. Splitting costs 50/50 when one partner earns significantly more might not be fair to the lower-earning partner. If they have different incomes, the financial burden is unequal. Maybe the guy is being too rigid about splitting everything equally without considering their different financial situations.\n\nBut then again, the guy might feel that since he's already paying rent for a place he's living in alone, adding someone else would mean sharing, so splitting costs equally is fair. However, when the other person moves in, the cost of rent and utilities might not just be split; maybe the total cost increases. So, if the apartment was already his and he's paying a certain amount, adding her would mean a larger space or a new apartment, which might be more expensive. Wait, the post says he rents a place by himself. So if she moves in, does he get a new apartment or stay in the same one? The original post doesn't specify, but maybe he's assuming the same apartment. If the apartment is the same size, then maybe the rent is the same, but they split it. However, if moving in together requires a new, more expensive place, that's a different scenario.\n\nAnother angle: the guy's perspective. He might have set up the place, made sacrifices to live downtown for his job, and now wants the new partner to contribute to his existing costs. That could be seen as splitting the costs of his current setup, not a new one. On the other hand, the girlfriend's friends argue that he's being unfair because of the income difference. Maybe they think she can't afford half, or that he should be the one to cover more since he's earning more.\n\nThe key here is the fairness based on income. If they are sharing all expenses equally, but one earns twice as much as the other, it might not be equitable. The girlfriend's income is lower, so paying half of the same amount could be a bigger strain on her. The guy's friends (or other responses) might argue that if they are a couple, combining finances is normal, or that splitting 50/50 is the standard practice regardless of income. But when there's a significant income disparity, that approach can lead to imbalance.\n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship. 1.5 years is a long time, but it's still relatively early for some people. The guy's stance could be about financial responsibility, but the girlfriend might see it as a partner not contributing fairly. The friends' reaction is important too, as they likely provide a social context of what's considered acceptable.\n\nI should also think about common AITA responses. Usually, the site looks for fairness and communication. If the guy is just following a 50/50 split without considering their different financial capabilities, that might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if he's been paying rent alone and now wants to split with someone else moving in, maybe that's understandable, but the income difference complicates it.\n\nAnother point: Maybe the guy is not considering that his girlfriend's salary is lower, so paying half the rent and other expenses might be a larger portion of her income. For example, if rent is $2000 a month, half is $1000. If her salary is $45k a year (~$3750 a month), that's about 26.7% of her income. If the guy makes $80k, that's about 13.3% of his monthly income. So, the split is a larger financial burden for her. In such cases, people often suggest that the higher earner should pay a larger share to balance the percentage of each person's income.\n\nHowever, the guy might not have considered this. The question is whether expecting a 50/50 split is wrong. The girlfriend's friends think he is, implying that he's being unfair. But if the guy's friends think he's right, it might lead to a different outcome. Since the user hasn't provided other perspectives, just the girlfriend's friends' opinion.\n\nIn some relationships, splitting costs 50/50 is standard, but when one partner's income is significantly different, adjusting the split based on income (like 60/40) is often considered more equitable. The author's approach might be seen as inflexible if they don't communicate or account for the income difference.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not considering the income disparity, leading to an unfair split for the lower-earning partner. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
