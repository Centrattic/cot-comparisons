My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old man, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since moving downtown for a job, making $80k a year, while she makes $45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. The question is whether splitting costs 50/50 is fair given their income disparity. Let me break it down. The author's income is significantly higher than his girlfriend's. If both are paying the same amount, she might be contributing a larger percentage of her income. For example, if the rent is $2000, he pays $1000 (which is about 12.5% of his income) while she pays $1000 (about 22% of hers). That could be seen as unfair to her. The girlfriend's friends likely think that because of the income difference, the split should be adjusted. \n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that when two people live together, splitting costs equally is fair, regardless of income, because it's about shared responsibility. But if one person is paying a much larger portion of their income, that could create resentment. The author might not realize how much of her income that requires, especially if she's also saving or has other expenses. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the standard is fairness based on income, then yes, maybe he is. If the standard is equal contribution regardless of income, then no. But since the girlfriend's friends and she perceive it as unfair, and given the income gap, it's possible the author is being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong). However, I should check if there are other factors. For example, maybe the apartment is in his name, so he's responsible for the full rent. But he's offering to split everything, which includes rent. If he's the one with the lease, maybe it's more about shared responsibility. But income disparity complicates it. I think the main point is that 50/50 split doesn't consider their different financial situations, leading to the conclusion that the author is in the wrong.\n"
