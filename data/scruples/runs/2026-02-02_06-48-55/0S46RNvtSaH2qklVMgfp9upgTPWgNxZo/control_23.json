I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that the guy is 22, she's 23, been together 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself, she wants to move in, and he wants her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks he's being unreasonable because he makes more money (80k vs her 45k). Her friends also think he's a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical expectations around splitting costs when couples live together. A 50/50 split is common, but maybe there are other factors like income disparity. The guy makes almost double what she does. If they split everything equally, he ends up contributing more in absolute terms. However, maybe the intention is to split responsibilities equally rather than based on income. \n\nSome people argue that splitting costs based on income is fairer, but others might say that once you're in a relationship, you should consider shared expenses regardless of income. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting a 50/50 split despite the income difference.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In many cultures, splitting expenses equally is standard unless there's a significant disparity. However, in some relationships, people adjust based on income. The key point here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable given the income difference. Since the girlfriend and her friends reacted negatively, maybe there's a perception that he's not being fair. But the author might argue that splitting equally is fair because they're sharing the living space equally. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe not necessarily. The right to expect a 50/50 split isn't inherently wrong, but the context of income could be a factor. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the community or common advice says that splitting based on income is more fair, then he might be wrong. But if equal split is acceptable regardless of income, then he's not. \n\nI think the answer depends on the reasoning. Since the author is expecting equal split without considering the income difference, some might see it as unfair to the lower-earning partner. However, others might say that splitting equally is standard. But given the girlfriend's reaction and the friends' opinions, there's a case that the author is not considering the financial inequality, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong. Wait, but maybe not. Because the intention is to split costs equally for shared expenses. If they are both living there, then 50/50 is fair. However, the income difference could mean that she's contributing a larger percentage of her income, which might be unfair. Hmm. \n\nI think I'm torn. But in many relationships, splitting costs equally is standard, regardless of income. So the author isn't wrong. But if the argument is that splitting based on income would be fairer, then he is wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the community might have different views, but the common practice is 50/50, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. However, considering that the income difference is significant, maybe he should be more flexible. But the question is about right or wrong. The answer likely depends on cultural context. In some places, 50/50 is expected. So the answer is B.\n"
