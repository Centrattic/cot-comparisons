She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that they're both in a 1.5-year relationship, and the guy rents a place by himself. His income is $80k, and her income is $45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries if they move in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices around splitting costs in a relationship. Usually, when two people move in together, the split can depend on various factors like income, how much each person benefits from the arrangement, or existing financial agreements. The guy's reasoning is that he wants to split everything 50/50. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unreasonable because of the income disparity.\n\nIn many relationships, people split costs based on proportion of income. So if he makes more, maybe he should cover a larger share. However, some couples prefer to split things evenly regardless of income for simplicity or because they see it as a shared home. The key here is that the guy is insisting on 50/50, but the girlfriend might feel that since he earns more, it's unfair for her to pay half. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of shared responsibility. If both are living in the same space and using the same resources, splitting 50/50 might make sense to each. However, if one person is contributing more, maybe the other should cover more. The girlfriend's friends also support her view that the guy is being a \"douche,\" which might indicate that society or common opinion leans towards splitting based on income differences.\n\nBut there's no universal right or wrong here. It depends on mutual agreement. The problem arises when one party feels it's unfair. If the guy is set on 50/50 and the girlfriend is uncomfortable, this could lead to conflict. The question is whether the author's stance is objectively wrong. \n\nLooking at the arguments, the girlfriend's side is that higher income should mean higher contribution. The guy's side is wanting equal split. Without more context, like if he's paying more on his own currently, or if there are other factors (like who owns the apartment, or if it's a new lease), it's hard to say. But typically, splitting 50/50 regardless of income might be seen as less fair when there's a significant income difference. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering the income disparity. But if they had agreed before moving in, it's a different story. Since the question is about right or wrong, and the girlfriend's friends also think he's wrong, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
