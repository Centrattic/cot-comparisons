I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask a Therapist (AITA) question is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that a 22-year-old guy (M22) is considering moving in with his girlfriend (F23) and wants to split the living costs 50/50. The girlfriend is upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. She and her friends think he's being a jerk by expecting her to pay half. The guy is asking if he's the asshole for wanting the split.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the guy is in the wrong. The key points here are about splitting costs based on income. The guy is making more money, so maybe he's being fair by suggesting 50/50, but the girlfriend feels it's unfair because of their different incomes. \n\nIn relationships, splitting costs can be a tricky subject. Some couples split things equally regardless of income, while others split based on proportion. If the guy is making more, maybe a proportional split would make sense, like each paying a percentage of their income. But the guy is suggesting equal dollar amounts, which might be harder on the girlfriend since she earns less. \n\nHowever, the guy's perspective is that moving in together means sharing the responsibilities and costs equally. He might not want to take on a larger share just because he earns more. On the other hand, the girlfriend's friends think he's being unreasonable. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? Well, both sides have valid points. If the girlfriend can't afford half the rent and utilities on her income, then the 50/50 split isn't fair. But if they can both manage it, then maybe it's okay. But the girlfriend's friends are against it, which might indicate that in their social circle, splitting based on income is the norm. \n\nThe question is whether the guy's stance is unreasonable. If he's not willing to discuss a different split and is insisting on 50/50 despite the income difference, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, wanting to split costs equally in a shared living arrangement is a common approach. \n\nI think it depends on the couple's agreement. The guy isn't necessarily in the wrong if they both agree to 50/50, but if the girlfriend is struggling to pay her share, then maybe the guy is being inflexible. Since the girlfriend is upset and her friends agree, there might be a cultural or social expectation in their environment that a fair split would be based on income. \n\nSo, maybe the guy is in the wrong because he's not considering the income disparity. But I'm not 100% sure. The answer might be a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because expecting equal payment when incomes are different can be unfair to the lower-earning partner. However, if they can both afford it, maybe not. But since the girlfriend is struggling, he should be more flexible. So, probably A.\n"
