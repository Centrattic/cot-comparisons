I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting living costs 50/50 when the girlfriend wants to move in together. The guy makes $80k and the girl makes $45k.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting expenses in relationships. Some people split 50/50 regardless of income, while others split based on income. The author's reasoning is to split everything equally, but the girlfriend and her friends think it's unfair because of the income disparity.\n\nI should check if 50/50 is a standard approach. I know that some couples do adjust based on income, especially if there's a significant difference. The guy's argument is that they're both living in the same place, so splitting costs equally makes sense. However, the girlfriend might feel that she's contributing less in absolute terms because her income is lower. That could create an imbalance in their financial responsibilities.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the couple hasn't discussed it beforehand and the guy is setting the expectation of 50/50, maybe he's not wrong. However, considering their incomes, the girlfriend might feel it's unfair. The key point is that communication is important. The guy might not be wrong for expecting her to contribute, but if they can't find a middle ground, there's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: some people might argue that splitting equally is fair because both are using the same living space. Others think that the higher earner should pay more. The friends' opinion that he's a \"douche\" leans towards AITA, but friends might be biased. The author's stance is clear, but the reaction from the girlfriend and her friends suggests that the author's approach is seen as unfair by their social circle.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether splitting costs equally is fair regardless of income. If the standard in their community is to split based on income, then the author is wrong. But if 50/50 is acceptable, then he's not. Since the girlfriend and her friends think he's wrong, it's possible that in their context, 50/50 is seen as unfair when incomes differ. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering the income difference.\n"
