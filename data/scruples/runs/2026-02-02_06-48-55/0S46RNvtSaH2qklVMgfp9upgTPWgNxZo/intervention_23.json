I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The author is male, 22, she's 23, and they've been together 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself, moved downtown for a job, and makes $80k, while she makes $45k. He's okay with her moving in but wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's a jerk for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the one who currently owns the place, so he's the one with the existing rent. If she moves in, splitting everything 50/50 would mean she's paying half of all the costs. But he makes more money, so he's earning more. The common advice in relationship forums is that splitting expenses 50/50 isn't fair if the incomes are unequal. That's because the person with lower income might be sacrificing a larger percentage of their income.\n\nThe girlfriend makes $45k, which is about half of his income. If the rent is, say, $2000 a month (which is high but possible depending on the city), splitting 50/50 would mean each pays $1000. For the author, that's about 2.5% of his income, while for her, it's around 5.5%. That's a significant difference in the burden. So, expecting her to pay half might be seen as unfair because she's paying a larger portion of her income.\n\nAlso, the author is the one who has the existing lease. If he's the one renting the place, it might be more reasonable for him to pay a larger share, especially if he's the one who benefits more from the location (downtown for his job). The girlfriend is moving in, so maybe she should pay a portion, but not necessarily half. \n\nThe friends' reactions are also a clue. They called him a \"douche\" and \"ass,\" which suggests that their social circle thinks it's unreasonable. Social norms often favor splitting based on income rather than 50/50 when there's a disparity. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's proposing a 50/50 split when their incomes are significantly different. A fairer approach might be to split based on income percentages. For example, if total income is $125k, he pays 64% and she 36%. That way, the financial burden is more proportional. The author's stance of 50/50 ignores the income disparity, which is why the girlfriend and her friends are upset. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
