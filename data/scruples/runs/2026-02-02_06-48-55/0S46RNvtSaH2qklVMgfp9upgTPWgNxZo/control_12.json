I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. The guy is 22, she's 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents alone since moving for a job, and now she wants to move in. He offers a 50-50 split on rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a \"dick\" because he makes 80k and she makes 45k.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether splitting 50-50 is unfair given their income difference. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, splitting costs evenly regardless of income is a common approach, especially if both are contributing to household expenses. However, when there's a significant income disparity, some might argue that the higher earner should contribute more, especially if the lower earner has other expenses or if the move affects their individual situations differently.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he's covering the rent alone now, and if she moves in, it's fair for her to cover half. He's essentially splitting the cost of the apartment he already has, which he's paying for alone. So by her moving in, she's helping him by splitting the expenses, which might reduce his monthly costs. From his perspective, it's fair for her to pay her share. \n\nHowever, her argument is that because he makes more, she should pay less. But if they're sharing the apartment and both benefit from it (like having someone to live with, maybe splitting the cost of a bigger place than she could afford alone), then a 50-50 split could be fair. The problem might be communication. Maybe she expected him to pay more because of his higher income, but he's not willing to.\n\nAnother angle: If the apartment is already his, moving in together might mean she's helping him reduce his costs, so he might not need to adjust the split as much. However, if they're moving into a new place together, it's a different scenario. But in this case, it's his current place, so he's saving money by her moving in. So maybe the 50-50 isn't fair because he's gaining more from the arrangement. But that's a bit complicated.\n\nCultural norms also play a role. In some cultures, splitting things equally is the norm regardless of income, while in others, the higher earner might be expected to contribute more. The fact that her friends called him a \"douche\" might indicate that in their social circle, the higher earner should pay more. But the author's stance is that splitting equally is fair because they're both living there.\n\nIs there any other information missing? The post doesn't mention if there are other factors, like who is buying groceries, how much the rent is, or if there are other shared expenses. But based on what's given, the core issue is the 50-50 split.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's subjective. Some might think that if one person's income is significantly higher, they should pay more. Others might say that as long as both are contributing a proportionate amount to the household expenses, it's fair. For example, if the rent is $2000, splitting it 50-50 would mean each pays $1000. If he makes 80k and she makes 45k, his share is about 1.25% of his income, and hers is 2.2%, which is a bigger portion of her income. That might be a point against the 50-50 split. But if they're both paying the same dollar amount, maybe they consider the value of the space they're using equally.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that she's expecting him to pay more because he can afford it more. However, if they're moving in together and both benefit, the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to split it evenly. Especially if he's not asking her to pay more than the 50% of the existing costs. He's not adding extra charges. It's about sharing the current expenses.\n\nAlso, the fact that she asked friends and they supported her view might influence the perception, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. People have different opinions on this. The key is whether the arrangement is fair and acceptable to both parties. Since the author is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the 50-50 split is considered fair in the context of their incomes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because splitting costs equally is a common approach, especially when both are contributing to the household. However, the income disparity might make some people argue that he should pay more. But without additional context, like other factors affecting fairness, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
