I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The girlfriend (F23) is making less money, 45k compared to his 80k. She thinks it's unfair, her friends agree, and now he's questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the fairness of splitting costs equally when their incomes are different. If both have the same expenses but different incomes, splitting 50/50 might not be fair. For example, if rent is $2000 a month, M22 is paying $1000 and F23 is paying $1000. But since M22 makes more, maybe she should contribute a smaller percentage of her income. Let's do some math. M22's 50% of rent is 1000/80000 = 1.25% of his income. F23's 1000/45000 \u2248 2.22%. So she's paying a higher percentage, which isn't equitable. \n\nIn relationships, splitting costs based on income is often considered fairer. So if they split the rent and utilities based on income, M22 would pay more than half. But the author wants 50/50, which could be seen as unfair to the girlfriend. The girlfriend's friends also think he's being unreasonable, which adds social proof to her perspective.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they are both living in the same space, using the same utilities, etc., so splitting equally is fair in terms of usage. But if their ability to pay differs, that's where the conflict arises. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation in the relationship. If they are in a long-term relationship, contributing based on income is common. But if they're just moving in together and not in a more committed stage, maybe splitting equally is acceptable. The duration of their relationship (1.5 years) might suggest they're considering a more serious commitment, so income-based splitting might be expected.\n\nSo the author's stance could be seen as not considering the partner's financial situation, leading to her feeling it's a \"huge dick move.\" Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A) because splitting equally ignores the income disparity. But some might say splitting equally is fair for shared expenses regardless of income (B). \n\nBut given the context and the general advice in such situations, the fairer approach is to split based on income. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
