My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that the guy is making $80k and the girlfriend is making $45k. He wants to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. His girlfriend and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices when couples move in together. Some people split things 50/50 regardless of income, while others adjust based on earnings. The key here is the significant difference in their incomes. If they split everything equally, the guy is effectively paying a smaller percentage of his income compared to hers.\n\nFor example, if the total monthly cost is, say, $3000, then each would pay $1500. The guy earns $80k annually, which is about $6667 monthly, so 1500 is around 22.5% of his income. The girl earns $45k annually, which is about $3750 monthly, so $1500 is 40% of her income. That's a big difference. From a financial fairness perspective, splitting the costs based on income might be more equitable. But the guy wants 50/50 regardless.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal values. Some couples prefer equal sharing of expenses, even if it's a larger portion of one person's income. It's a matter of what each person considers fair. The girlfriend's friends are siding with her, implying that expecting her to pay half when she earns less is unfair. However, the guy's reasoning is that they're living together, so each should cover their own share.\n\nAnother angle: the guy already has the apartment. If the girlfriend is moving in, maybe he's already paying the rent, and splitting it could be a way to share the cost. But if the rent is higher when they move in together (maybe a bigger place?), that's another factor. The original scenario says he's renting a place by himself since graduating, so maybe the new place's rent is similar. \n\nThe main issue is whether 50/50 is fair when there's a significant income disparity. If the couple is on the same page about financial expectations, it's manageable. But if they can't agree, that's a problem. The author's request isn't inherently wrong, but it's a matter of differing values. However, given that the girlfriend is earning less, expecting her to pay half of all expenses could be seen as unfair to her, hence the friends' reactions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's subjective, but since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the girlfriend's perspective is valid, maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong). But others might argue it's not wrong if they agree to it. However, given the common advice in such situations, often suggesting splitting based on income when there's a large difference, the author's stance might be seen as not considering her financial burden. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
