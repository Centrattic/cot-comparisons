      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a 22-year-old male, is renting a place by himself since he moved downtown for a job a year ago. His girlfriend, who is 23 and they've been together for 1.5 years, wants to move in together. He's okay with that but insists she should cover half of the rent, utilities, and groceries. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unreasonable, especially since he makes $80k a year and she makes $45k. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the main issue is splitting living costs equally. The author wants a 50/50 split regardless of their incomes. The girlfriend and her friends argue that since he earns more, he should pay more. So, the core of the problem is the fairness of the split in relation to their earnings.\n\nI know that financial arrangements in relationships can be tricky. Some people split expenses equally regardless of income, while others adjust based on income. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but there are common practices. \n\nIn many cases, splitting costs 50/50 is a common approach, especially if both are contributing equally in other ways, like time or effort. However, considering their income disparity, some might argue that the higher earner should cover a larger share. This could be seen as more equitable, especially if the lower earner has other financial responsibilities or if the higher earner can afford to contribute more. \n\nBut the author's stance is that he wants her to pay half of everything. If he already has a place and is now adding her to the lease, maybe he's expecting her to take over 50% of the costs. However, if the apartment was originally his and he's now inviting her in, it's possible that he expects her to split costs, but the girlfriend might feel that since he has a higher income, he should take on more. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"needs\" versus \"ability to pay.\" The girlfriend might have higher living expenses elsewhere, but since they're moving in together, the shared costs are split. But since the author is earning more, maybe he can afford to take a larger portion. However, if the 50/50 split is based on fairness because they're both living in the same space, then it's not necessarily wrong. \n\nCultural norms also play a role. In some cultures, the man is expected to cover more, while in others, equality is emphasized regardless of income. The girlfriend's friends might be influenced by their cultural or personal beliefs about what's fair. \n\nIt's also important to consider communication. The author might not have considered her perspective, but he's stating his conditions upfront. The girlfriend might feel it's unfair given their income difference. However, if they're entering a partnership, discussing and agreeing on financial responsibilities is crucial. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they choose to split equally, but it's a matter of mutual agreement. \n\nI think the key here is whether the expectation of 50/50 is reasonable given their financial situations. If both can afford half, there's no issue. But if the lower earner is struggling, then maybe the split should be adjusted. The author's income is higher, so taking a larger share could reduce the financial burden on her. However, the author might feel that since they're living together equally, splitting costs equally is fair. \n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong, but the author's stance might be seen as less considerate of the income disparity. But if both agree to it and can afford it, then it's not wrong. However, the girlfriend and her friends are pointing out that considering the income difference, the author should pay more. So, depending on perspective, the author could be in the wrong if fairness is based on income, but not if fairness is based on equal contribution regardless of income.\n"
