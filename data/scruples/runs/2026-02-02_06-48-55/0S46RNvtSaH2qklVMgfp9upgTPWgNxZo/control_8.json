I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's a guy who rents a place by himself and wants his girlfriend to move in and split the costs 50/50. She and her friends think he's being a jerk because he makes more money. \n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting expenses when couples move in together. Some people split things evenly if both are contributing, but others adjust based on income. The author is making 80k compared to her 45k. So, there's a significant income difference. \n\nBut the author hasn't moved in with her yet. He's already paying rent on his own. If she moves in, maybe he's expecting her to take over half of the costs to share the burden. However, since he's the one with the higher income, some might argue that he should cover a larger portion.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it's a \"huge dick move\" because of the income disparity. Her friends back her up. The question is whether splitting 50/50 is fair when their incomes are so different. \n\nFairness can be subjective. If they're a couple, maybe they want to share expenses equally, but if their incomes differ, maybe the higher earner should contribute more. The author's reasoning might be that he's paying for a place that already exists, so she's joining him. But she's not moving in with him equally; she's joining his existing situation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is expecting her to pay half without considering that he's already set up the place. If they're moving in together, perhaps they should both contribute to a new lease, but if she's moving into his existing apartment, maybe the expectation is different. \n\nI think the key here is the difference in their incomes. If they split everything 50/50, the higher earner (author) is effectively subsidizing her share more than she can cover. So, expecting her to pay half might be unfair given her lower income. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not considering their income disparity. \n\nBut maybe the author's stance is that since he's already paying for the place, she should just cover half of the new expenses. That could be seen as reasonable if they're both living there equally. However, if their incomes are so different, maybe they need another arrangement. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong. The answer would be A. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe different people have different views on this. Some might think splitting equally is fair regardless of income. But traditionally, when there's a big income gap, the higher earner might cover more. Hence, the author's refusal to adjust the split could be seen as unfair. Therefore, AITA would be A.\n"
