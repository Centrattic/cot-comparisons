I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. The situation is that the author (M22) is renting a place alone and has a girlfriend (F23). She wants to move in together, and he's proposing a 50/50 split. She argues that since he makes $80k and she makes $45k, he shouldn't expect her to pay half. Her friends also think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting costs based on income. Typically, splitting costs equally might not be fair if the partners have significantly different incomes. If both are contributing the same amount, the higher earner isn't necessarily contributing proportionally to their means. So, maybe the author is expecting an equal split without considering their different financial situations. \n\nHowever, when roommates split costs, it's common to split them 50/50 unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise, like one person having a larger room or other factors. But in this case, they're a couple, not just roommates. The expectation might be different. Maybe the author is being reasonable in wanting to split costs equally since they both live in the same space. But considering the income disparity, expecting her to pay half might not be fair to her, especially if she's contributing a larger percentage of her income.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is the one who owns the lease. If he's the one who's already paying rent, moving someone in might require her to take over part of the lease or become a co-tenant. In some places, roommates might split utilities and rent, but if the lease is in his name, maybe he's responsible for the rent and she's helping with utilities. But the author is asking her to pay half everything, which could be a problem if the rent is the main cost.\n\nAlso, the fact that her friends called him a douche might indicate that the community or common practice doesn't support equal splits in such income disparities. Maybe the author isn't wrong in wanting a 50/50 split as a baseline, but the issue is that he's not considering their different financial situations. The right approach might be splitting based on income, like he pays a larger share since he earns more, which would be fairer. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering proportional contributions based on income.\n\nBut I should also check if there's any other factors. The author is the one renting, so maybe he's the one who's invested more in the place. If she moves in, she's getting a room without the responsibilities of the lease. So maybe he's being reasonable to split equally. But if her income is lower, a 50/50 split could be a burden on her. It's a balance between fairness and practicality.\n\nIn relationships, splitting costs is often a personal decision. However, when there's a significant income difference, splitting equally can be unfair. Therefore, the author's stance might not be wrong in terms of equal contribution, but it's not fair considering their incomes. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's not accounting for the income disparity.\n"
