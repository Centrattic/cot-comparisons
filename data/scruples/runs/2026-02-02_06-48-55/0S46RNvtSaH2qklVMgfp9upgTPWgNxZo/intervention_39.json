I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person writing the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, she's 23. They've been together 1.5 years. He rents alone since moving downtown for a job. She wants to move in with him. He says she should cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's a jerk because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Financial contributions in relationships can be tricky. The guy's position is that he's splitting costs equally. But the girlfriend is arguing that since he earns more, maybe she should contribute less. Her friends back her up, calling him a douche. \n\nI need to consider common norms. In some cases, people split costs equally regardless of income, especially if they're sharing the space equally. Others argue that higher income should mean a larger share. But there's no one-size-fits-all answer. \n\nThe guy's reasoning is that it's fair to split equally. But others might see it as unfair if one person makes significantly more. The girlfriend might feel that the guy is not considering their different financial situations. \n\nThe guy's income is almost double hers. So, if they split 50/50, she's paying a larger percentage of her income. That could be a burden for her. However, if they live together, they both benefit from the shared space. The guy might be paying more in rent, but he's the one who owns the place already. \n\nBut does that matter? If he's already paying for the place by himself, maybe he's in a better position to cover the costs. When someone moves in, the natural expectation might be that both contribute. But if he's the one who's already paying, maybe he's expecting her to cover half regardless of income? That might come off as not considering her financial situation. \n\nHer friends' reaction suggests that they think he's being unreasonable. Maybe in their opinion, the higher earner should contribute more. The guy's stance is that he's being fair, but if the financial impact is different for each person, maybe he's not being fair. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's possible that the community would see him as not being flexible. The answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because expecting equal contributions without considering income disparity could be seen as unfair. However, others might argue that splitting costs equally is fair regardless of income. \n\nBut given that the girlfriend is lower income and the friends support her, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
