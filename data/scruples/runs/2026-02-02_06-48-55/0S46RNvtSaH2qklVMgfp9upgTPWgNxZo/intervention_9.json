I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. The situation is that the guy is making 80k a year, and his girlfriend makes 45k. He wants her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that splitting costs equally might not always be fair if the incomes are different. If they're moving in together, their financial situations should be considered. The guy is making almost double what she is. So if they split everything 50/50, he's contributing a smaller percentage of his income compared to hers. For example, if rent is $2000 a month, he's paying $1000, which is 4.17% of his monthly income (assuming 80k is $6666.67 a month). She's paying the same $1000, which is 22.2% of her $4166.67 monthly income. That's a big difference. So maybe splitting equally is unfair because her share is a larger burden on her income.\n\nBut some people might argue that splitting the actual costs equally is fair regardless of income. Like, the apartment is the same size, so each pays half. But when looking at the proportion of their incomes, it's not equitable. Also, maybe the guy is used to living alone, so moving in together might lower his overall expenses compared to her. If she was living alone before, moving in together could save her money, while for him, it's just splitting his existing costs.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's friends think he's being a jerk. That could indicate that there's a social norm where splitting equally is not expected when incomes differ. Maybe the common approach is to account for income differences. For example, splitting based on income ratios. So if combined income is 125k, he pays 80/125 = 64%, she pays 36%. That would make the expenses more balanced in terms of percentage of their earnings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the expectation is to split equally but the financial impact is unequal, then he might be at fault for not considering her financial situation. Alternatively, if the expectation is that splitting costs equally is fair regardless of income, then he's not wrong.\n\nBut in many relationships, fairness is about the proportion each partner is contributing. So if the guy is making more, it's reasonable to expect him to cover a larger percentage. By insisting on 50/50, he's shifting a larger burden onto her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
