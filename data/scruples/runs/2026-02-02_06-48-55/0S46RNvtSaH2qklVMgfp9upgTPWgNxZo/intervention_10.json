I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50. The author is a male in his early 20s, and his girlfriend is a female in her early 20s. They've been together for 1.5 years. The author currently rents a place by himself since he moved downtown for a job after graduating. His GF wants to move in with him and he's asking her to cover half of the rent, utilities, and groceries. The GF thinks that's a \"huge dick move\" because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also said he's being a douche.\n\nSo, the main question is whether splitting costs 50/50 is fair given the income disparity. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if AITA (Am I the Asshole) applies here. \n\nFirst, the concept of splitting costs 50/50 doesn't necessarily take income into account. If both are living in the same place, it's common to split expenses equally, but when one's income is significantly higher, some people might argue that the higher earner should contribute more. However, others might say that splitting equally is fair because both are using the same space and resources.\n\nThe GF and her friends think the author is being unfair. The key point here is the difference in their incomes. The author makes about 78% more than his GF. If they split everything 50/50, the GF would be contributing a larger percentage of her income towards the shared costs. That could be seen as unfair, especially if their spending habits or other financial responsibilities differ.\n\nBut sometimes, couples choose to split expenses equally regardless of income because it simplifies things and both benefit equally from the shared living situation. The problem arises when the split doesn't consider the proportion of their incomes. So, maybe the author didn't consider that the GF's contribution is a larger financial burden for her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's stance is clear, but the GF feels it's unfair. It's possible that the author is not wrong because he's upfront about his expectations, but maybe he's not considering her perspective. Alternatively, he might be in the wrong if he's not willing to negotiate a different split based on their incomes.\n\nAnother angle: if the author is paying for the place by himself now, offering to split costs might be a good gesture, but the 50/50 split might not account for their different financial situations. Maybe a 60/40 or another split based on income would be fairer. However, the author is not offering that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the expectation is to split equally without considering income, then maybe yes, because it's not equitable. But if the norm in their culture or their relationship is to split equally regardless, then maybe no. The friends' reaction suggests that in their social circle, the author is seen as the asshole. The GF's friends might think that because of the income difference, the author should contribute more. \n\nIn summary, the fairness here depends on whether splitting costs equally is appropriate given their income disparity. Since the GF and her friends see it as unfair, and the income difference is significant, the author might be in the wrong for not considering a different split. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
