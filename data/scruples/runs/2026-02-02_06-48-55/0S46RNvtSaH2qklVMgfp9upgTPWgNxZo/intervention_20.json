I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. The author is making 80k, and the girlfriend is making 45k. The girlfriend and her friends think it's a huge move for the author to expect her to pay half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common views on splitting costs in a relationship. Some people think it should be 50/50 regardless of income, while others believe it should be based on each person's ability to pay. The author's reasoning is fair in the sense that if they live together, splitting the costs equally is a straightforward approach. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that since the author earns more, they should contribute more. \n\nThe key point here is the assumption that the author is in the wrong. The user thinks so, but the answer could vary. I should check if there are any cultural or societal norms that might influence this. In some contexts, splitting costs 50/50 is standard, even if one partner earns more. In others, especially when there's a significant income disparity, splitting by income (like the higher earner paying a larger share) is considered fairer. \n\nThe author's job required moving downtown, which might mean they chose a more expensive area. If the higher rent is due to their job, maybe the author should consider covering more. But if the apartment is in a city with high costs overall, then splitting 50/50 might be reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends say the author is a \"douche\" and an \"ass,\" which is a strong reaction. That could indicate that in her social circle, splitting based on income is the norm. However, the author might not have considered this, expecting equal contribution regardless of income. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the expectation in their relationship or society was to split based on income, then yes. But if they were both going to be sharing the space equally and the cost is the same for both, 50/50 is fair. The problem is the girlfriend's friends immediately labeled the author as wrong without considering their perspective. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong if they're both contributing equally to the household. But if the higher earner is supposed to take on more, then the author is in the right. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate. Since the author is willing to split everything 50/50, including rent, which is a big part of the cost. If the girlfriend is coming from a lower income, maybe the author should consider an adjusted split. However, the author might have a different view of fairness. The answer could be A or B depending on the reasoning, but the girlfriend's friends' reaction being harsh might suggest that the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, the author could be seen as not being considerate of the income difference. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting equal contribution without considering the income disparity can be unfair. However, others might argue B (not in the wrong) if 50/50 is the agreed norm. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's friends are against it and the income difference is significant, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more flexible. But the author might have different expectations. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A.\n"
