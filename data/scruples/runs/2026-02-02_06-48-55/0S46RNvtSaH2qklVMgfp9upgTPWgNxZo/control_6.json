I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He's renting a place by himself since he moved downtown for a job last June. Now she wants to move in together, and he's saying she should pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks it's unfair because he makes around $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nSo, the key points here are the income disparity and the expectation of splitting costs equally. The question is whether the author is wrong for this arrangement. \n\nFirst, splitting costs 50/50 is a common approach, but it's not the only way couples handle finances. Some couples split based on income, others have different arrangements. The main issue here is that the author's income is significantly higher than his girlfriend's. If they split everything equally, he's effectively paying more in terms of his income percentage. For example, if rent is $1,000 a month, he's contributing about 1.25% of his income, whereas she's contributing about 2.22%. That might be seen as unfair to her because she's paying a larger proportion of her income.\n\nBut on the other hand, splitting expenses equally can simplify things and ensure both partners contribute the same amount regardless of income. The author might not see the income difference as a factor he needs to consider, which could lead to tension if the girlfriend feels it's unfair. The fact that her friends supported her view suggests that others might see the author's stance as not considering the income imbalance.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning could be that splitting costs equally is fair because they both live in the same space and use the same utilities. He might not have considered that their different incomes make an equal split unequal in terms of financial burden. The girlfriend's argument is about proportional contribution based on income, which is a valid perspective.\n\nIn relationships, financial expectations can vary, and communication is key. The author might not be wrong per se, but he could be approaching the situation without considering the income disparity. The core issue is perspective: the author sees equal contribution as fair, while the girlfriend sees proportional contribution as fair. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether equal split without considering income is considered fair in their context.\n\nSince the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and given that many people might argue that considering income when splitting costs is fair, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong. However, it's also possible that some would argue splitting costs 50/50 is fair regardless of income. But given that the girlfriend's side is supported by her friends and the income difference is significant, the more common ethical stance might be that the author is not considering the income disparity, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
