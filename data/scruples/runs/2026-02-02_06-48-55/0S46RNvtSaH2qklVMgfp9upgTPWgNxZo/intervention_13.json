I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years, and he's currently renting alone. He makes $80k, she makes $45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks it's unfair because of their income difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Some couples split things 50/50 regardless of income, others split based on income percentage. The author's approach is 50/50, which might not account for their different earnings. His GF and her friends think he's being unreasonable, given his higher income. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It depends on what the couple agrees on. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key issue is whether a 50/50 split is fair when their incomes are significantly different. If the author is making more, expecting equal contributions could be seen as not considering their financial situations. The GF might expect a different split, like splitting based on income percentages. \n\nIn many cases, splitting costs proportionally to income is considered fairer. So if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, combined income is 125k. His share would be 64% (80/125) and hers 36%. A 50/50 split in this case would mean he's contributing less proportionally than his income. That could be seen as unfair to her. Therefore, the author's demand might not be fair, especially since he's the higher earner. \n\nBut the other side is that splitting equally is also common, especially if the couple is on equal footing in other aspects. However, given the income disparity, the GF's perspective is valid. The author's friends and GF find it unreasonable, which could indicate that the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his demand doesn't account for their different incomes, and a more equitable split might be expected.\n"
