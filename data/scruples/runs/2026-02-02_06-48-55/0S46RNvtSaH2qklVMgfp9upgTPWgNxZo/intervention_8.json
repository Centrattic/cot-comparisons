      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years, the guy is 22, she's 23. He rents a place alone since moving for a job, and she wants to move in. He says she should pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable because he makes 80k and she makes 45k. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard for splitting costs in a relationship. Typically, splitting 50/50 is common, but some people split based on income. The author is asking for equal splits regardless of income difference. The girlfriend's argument is that since he earns more, maybe he should pay more. However, the author is paying half of his own rent already, so adding her in would double the cost, but splitting equally would mean each pays half of the total. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the guy is already paying his own rent, and she's moving in, maybe the total cost would be higher than just doubling his current rent. For example, if his current rent is X, the new rent might be X + Y where Y is higher due to a larger place or better location. But the problem here is the immediate split. The guy wants her to pay half of everything, so if he's paying X alone, with her it would be X/2 each? That doesn't make sense because the total would still be X. Wait, maybe he's moving to a bigger place? The original post says he rents a place by himself since moving downtown. If she moves in, maybe the rent increases, so splitting the new total equally. But the problem is, he's making 80k and she's making 45k. If they split 50/50 regardless of income, that could be seen as unfair, especially if the rent is a significant portion of their income. \n\nCalculating the percentage of their income: Let's say rent is, for example, $2000 a month. If they split 50/50, each pays $1000. For him, that's 2000/80k = 2.5%, while for her, 2000/45k is about 4.4%. So it's a bigger hit on her income. However, if the rent was $1000 before, moving to a $2000 place, each paying $1000, then his contribution is 12.5% of his income, and hers is 22.2%. That's a bigger disparity. \n\nIn traditional relationships, splitting costs based on income is sometimes considered fair, but sometimes people just split equally because it's easier and both are contributing to shared expenses. The girlfriend's friends think the author is being unreasonable, which might suggest that in their social circle, splitting based on income is more common. However, the author is in his early 20s, so maybe he's used to paying for himself and wants to maintain that. \n\nThe key issue is whether 50/50 is fair when there's a significant income difference. Some argue that splitting equally is fair because it's about equal contribution, not about income. Others say that if one earns more, they should cover a larger share. Since the author is making more, maybe expecting her to pay half could be seen as not considering their different financial situations. However, if they're moving in together, both are contributing to the household, and 50/50 is standard. \n\nBut in this case, the author is already paying for the place alone, so adding her in would mean the total costs are split, but the initial setup might be different. Maybe the author is not considering that the girlfriend's share is a larger proportion of her income. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible. Alternatively, if they agree that splitting equally is fair, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural norms and personal values. If the community standard is to split based on income, then the author is wrong. If 50/50 is standard despite income, then he's not. Since the girlfriend and her friends think he's wrong, it's possible that in their context, splitting by income is more accepted. However, the author's stance is that it's his place, so maybe he's trying to maintain control over the finances, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not accounting for their differing financial situations, expecting equal contribution regardless of income, which could place a heavier burden on the lower-earning partner.\n"
