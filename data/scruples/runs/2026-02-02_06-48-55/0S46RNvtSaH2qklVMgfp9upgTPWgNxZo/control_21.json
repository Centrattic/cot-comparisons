I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that they've been dating for 1.5 years, he's renting a place alone since moving for his job. His GF wants to move in, and he's insisting she pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She's arguing against it because of their income difference\u2014his 80k vs her 45k. Her friends also think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices around splitting costs in relationships. Generally, splitting costs equally is common, but sometimes couples adjust based on income disparity. The author is suggesting 50/50 regardless of their earnings. His GF and her friends think it's unfair because he makes more. \n\nThe key points here are income difference and expectations. The author might think that since they're living together, splitting costs equally is fair. However, considering their income, he earns about 73% of their combined income. If they split everything 50/50, she might end up paying a larger portion of her income, which could feel unfair to her. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs proportionally to income is a common approach when there's a significant income difference. For example, if he makes more, he might cover more of the rent and utilities, while she covers a proportionate share. Alternatively, some couples might split certain things 50/50 (like groceries) and adjust others based on income. \n\nBut the author is insisting on 50/50 across the board. His GF's argument is that since he makes more, she shouldn't have to pay half. Her friends back this up. The question is whether his stance is unreasonable. \n\nFinancial fairness in relationships can be subjective. Some people believe in equal splitting regardless of income, while others adjust based on earnings. The author's approach is standard in many cases, but when there's a significant income gap, it might lead to resentment. \n\nIn this case, the author's income is almost double his GF's. If they split rent and utilities equally, she's paying a larger percentage of her income. For example, if rent is $2000, he's paying 25% of his income (80k/12 = ~6667/month, 2000 is 30%) and she's paying about 44% (2000/45k*12 \u2248 44%). That's a big difference. So, from her perspective, it's unfair. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they're sharing the home equally, so equal costs are fair. But the financial impact on each is different. The question is whether the author is wrong to not consider the income disparity. \n\nIn terms of standards, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. But many financial advisors suggest that couples should consider their individual incomes when splitting costs. So insisting on 50/50 in this case might not be fair, hence the author could be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Maybe they plan to move into his existing apartment, which he already pays for. If she's joining him, maybe he expects her to contribute equally. However, since he's already paying rent, adding her as a roommate would mean splitting the cost. But her income is lower, so the proportion is higher for her. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because he's not considering the income difference, leading to an unequal financial burden. However, others might argue that 50/50 is fair if they both live there equally. But given the significant income gap, adjusting the split seems more equitable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
