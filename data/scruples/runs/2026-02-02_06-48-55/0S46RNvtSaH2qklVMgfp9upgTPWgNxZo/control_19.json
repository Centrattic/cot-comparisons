      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend is in the wrong. The guy is 22, she's 23, been together 1.5 years. He's renting a place alone since he graduated and moved downtown for a job last June. Now she wants to move in, and he's insisting she pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes 80k and she makes 45k, and her friends think he's being a \"douche\" or \"ass\" for wanting a 50/50 split.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. First, the general idea of splitting costs 50/50 when two people live together is common. But the girlfriend argues that since he earns more, he should pay more. So, the issue here is splitting equally versus splitting based on income. \n\nIn relationships, it's often suggested that splitting expenses based on individual income is fairer because it accounts for each person's financial capacity. So if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, their combined income is 125k. His share would be 64% and hers 36%. Therefore, splitting 50/50 might not be fair if their incomes are significantly different. \n\nBut the flip side is that when people move in together, sometimes they choose to split everything equally as a way to share the household equally, regardless of income. It's a personal agreement. However, the girlfriend might feel that since he's making more, he should contribute more. Her friends agreeing with her suggests that maybe his approach is seen as less considerate of the income disparity. \n\nThe key here is that fairness can be subjective. If the guy is insisting on 50/50 without considering their different earnings, that could be seen as unfair. Especially if the rent and utilities are high, and her 45k might not cover her half easily. If he's okay with paying more because he earns more, that might resolve the conflict. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not taking into account the income difference. The answer would be A.\n"
