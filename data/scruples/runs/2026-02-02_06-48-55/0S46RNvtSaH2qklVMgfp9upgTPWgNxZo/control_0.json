I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the guy is in the wrong for wanting to split the costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They've been together a year and a half. He rents a place by himself since moving downtown for a job. His salary is 80k, and hers is 45k. He's saying he wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm, splitting costs 50/50 regardless of income differences could be an issue. If their incomes are different, splitting equally might not be fair. Like, if he's making twice as much, maybe he can afford to pay more. But he might be thinking that moving in together is sharing expenses equally. On the other hand, expecting her to pay half of everything when her income is lower might put a strain on her finances. \n\nBut wait, maybe the guy is just trying to be fair in his own way. He's already paying for the place by himself, so adding a roommate would naturally split the costs. But traditional roommate splits are often based on income or other factors. If they're in a relationship, maybe the expectation is different. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nSome people might argue that in a relationship, you should consider each other's financial situations and find a split that reflects that. Others might say that splitting 50/50 is standard when you're both contributing to the household. It's possible that the guy isn't wrong because he's just applying a standard roommate approach. However, considering the income disparity, maybe he is being a bit insensitive. \n\nAlso, her friends' opinions might be influenced by their own biases. Maybe they think that men should pay more, but that's not a universal standard. The key point is that the guy is insisting on 50/50 without considering the differing incomes. That could be seen as unfair, hence him being in the wrong. But maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the 50/50 split is fair given the income difference. If the guy is making significantly more, expecting her to pay half might be unreasonable. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
