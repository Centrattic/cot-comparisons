I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50. The author is a guy who rents a place alone after graduating and moving for a job. His girlfriend, who's a year younger, suggests moving in together. He wants her to cover half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks it's unfair because his income is higher (80k vs her 45k). Her friends back her up, saying he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common approaches to splitting costs when couples live together. Some couples split things evenly, especially if they're in a committed relationship and plan to stay together. Others might split based on income. The author's position is 50/50 regardless of income. The girlfriend's side is that since he earns more, he should pay a larger share. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the income disparity and the expectation of splitting equally. In relationships, splitting costs 50/50 can be standard, especially if both are living in the same place and benefiting equally. However, some might argue that the higher-earning partner should contribute more, especially if there are other factors like different financial responsibilities or life stages. \n\nThe author moved into the apartment alone, so he might have already committed to the lease and the location because of his job. If the girlfriend is moving in, he's offering her equal responsibility, which makes sense if they're both living there. The fact that he's paying a significant portion of rent himself might mean that splitting the costs equally could impact him more financially, but he's still agreeing to split it 50/50, which could be fair if they're sharing the space equally. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend's friends and her own argument is that because he makes more, he should pay more. That's a valid perspective too. The question is whether fairness is determined by income or by equal sharing of expenses. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some places, splitting costs 50/50 is common regardless of income, while in others, it's expected that the higher earner covers more. Without specific cultural context, it's hard to say, but generally, if two people live together, splitting costs equally is a standard approach unless there's a different agreement. \n\nThe author's stance isn't necessarily wrong if they're both using the apartment equally. However, he might not be considering the income disparity. But if they're both living there and the agreement is 50/50, it's a shared responsibility. The girlfriend's friends might be biased, but their opinion isn't definitive. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's request is fair. If the couple is moving in together and sharing the space equally, splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if they were to split based on income, that's a different scenario. But since he's asking for 50/50, and the girlfriend's argument is about income, the author's position is defensible. Thus, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
