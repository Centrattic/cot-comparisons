She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The guy is 22, she's 23, they've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since moving for a job, and she wants to move in. He's asking her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks it's unfair because he makes 80k and she makes 45k. Her friends also say he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Some people split things evenly regardless of income, others adjust based on earnings. The author is suggesting a 50/50 split, which might be standard for some, but others might consider income disparity. \n\nThe key factors here are their respective incomes. He earns significantly more than her. If they split everything equally, he's contributing more in absolute terms. However, if they split based on income, he would pay a larger share. The author's stance is that he wants equal splitting, not considering income. \n\nSome people might argue that splitting based on income is fairer, especially if they're in a long-term relationship. Others might say that once you're living together, splitting 50/50 is fair because they're sharing the space and resources equally. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that since he makes more, he should pay more. Her friends back her up. So there's a cultural or societal expectation here that the higher earner should cover more. However, this isn't a universal rule. It can depend on the couple's agreement and values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the 50/50 split is unreasonable given their income difference. If the couple can afford the 50/50 split and it's agreed upon, it's not inherently wrong. However, if it causes financial strain for her or if the split doesn't reflect their contributions, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn this case, since they are moving in together and the author is asking for equal split regardless of income, some might say he's not considering her financial situation. On the other hand, if the apartment was his before she moved in, maybe he expects her to contribute equally to maintain the space. There's also the point about him renting the place alone initially, so maybe the cost is based on his previous setup. If the apartment size or location is the same, splitting 50/50 makes sense. But if he's making more, maybe the split should be adjusted.\n\nOverall, the answer could be either A or B depending on perspective. However, since the majority of the girlfriend's friends and her own reaction suggest that the author is being unreasonable, it's possible that the answer leans towards A. But I need to check if there's a standard. In many relationships, splitting based on income is more common when there's a significant difference. So, not considering income might be the issue here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible. Answer A.\n"
