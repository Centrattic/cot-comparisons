I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend is wrong. The guy is 22, making $80k, and the GF is 23, making $45k. He offers to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm. So, the key factors here are income disparity and splitting the costs equally. Normally, when couples split expenses, it's common to consider their respective incomes. If one person earns significantly more, expecting an equal split might seem unfair to the other. \n\nThe guy is making almost double what she is. If they split everything 50/50 regardless of income, the GF would be contributing a larger percentage of her income towards the shared expenses. For example, if rent is $2000 a month, she's paying $1000 (which is about 22% of her $45k) versus him paying $1000 (about 12.5% of his $80k). That might feel unequal because she's sacrificing more of her income. \n\nBut the guy's reasoning might be that they live together, so splitting costs equally is fair since they're both using the same space and resources. However, considering their incomes, a percentage-based split might be more equitable. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for insisting on 50/50. \n\nIt's possible that the guy isn't wrong because he's offering to split the costs, which is a common approach. But others might argue that considering their income difference, he should contribute more. The GF and her friends think he's wrong, but maybe that's because they perceive the income gap. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and what each person considers fair. In some relationships, 50/50 is standard, regardless of income. Others adjust based on earnings. The guy isn't necessarily wrong for proposing a 50/50 split, but he might need to have a conversation about how their different incomes affect the fairness. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, so if the standard is that splitting based on income is the norm, then he is wrong. But if 50/50 is acceptable, then he's not. \n\nGiven that the GF's friends called him a douche, maybe the community expects considering income. But in many cases, splitting equally is acceptable unless there's a significant disparity. But with such a big income gap, maybe he should adjust. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. So perhaps the answer is B (No), because he's not wrong for proposing a 50/50 split, even though there's room for negotiation. But others might think he's wrong for not considering income. It's a bit of a gray area, but I'll go with B because he's not necessarily in the wrong; it's a matter of differing opinions on fairness.\n"
