I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50. The author is a guy making $80k, and his girlfriend makes around $45k. They've been together for a year and a half. He's renting a place alone and wants her to pay half of everything. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm. The main point here is about splitting costs based on income. If both parties agree, maybe 50/50 is fair. But if one person's income is significantly lower, maybe splitting equally isn't fair. The author is making more money, so expecting her to pay half might not consider their different financial situations. \n\nIn many relationships, people adjust contributions based on income differences. For example, the higher earner might pay a larger share, especially if the lower earner is a student or has other expenses. The author's stance could be seen as not accounting for their financial disparity. His girlfriend's friends also think he's in the wrong, which might indicate a common perspective that splitting based on income is fairer.\n\nSo, if the author insists on 50/50 without considering their income difference, he might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
