I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting living costs 50/50 between a boyfriend and girlfriend. The boyfriend (M22) is making $80k and the girlfriend (F23) is making $45k. He wants her to pay half of the rent, utilities, and groceries when they move in together. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common norms around splitting costs in relationships. Some people split expenses equally, regardless of income, while others adjust based on income disparities. The key factors here are the significant income difference and the expectation of 50/50 splitting. The boyfriend is making almost double what she is. If they split everything 50/50, he's effectively paying a smaller percentage of his income compared to hers. That might not be fair in terms of financial contribution relative to their earnings.\n\nBut then again, some people argue that once you're in a shared living situation, splitting costs equally is standard, especially if both are contributing to the household. However, if one partner's income is significantly higher, expecting the lower-earning partner to cover half might place a heavier financial burden on them. The girlfriend's friends calling him a \"douche\" suggests that in their opinion, his stance is unfair given the income disparity.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of financial equality in relationships. If they are in a long-term partnership, some might argue that they should adjust contributions based on their ability to pay. However, others might see 50/50 as a fair way to ensure both parties are equally invested in the living arrangement, regardless of income.\n\nI should also consider the duration of their relationship and their future plans. They've been together for 1.5 years, so it's possible they are planning for a more committed future. If they're moving in together, the approach to splitting costs can affect their dynamic. If the higher earner takes on a larger share, it might lead to resentment from the lower earner if they feel they're contributing less. Conversely, if the lower earner is expected to pay half, the higher earner might feel they aren't contributing as much as they could.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility and independence. The boyfriend currently rents a place on his own, so bringing in his girlfriend to share costs is a mutual decision. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect her to cover half of all expenses, especially given her lower income. If they are moving in together, the 50/50 split might be seen as fair in terms of shared responsibility, but the income difference complicates that.\n\nIn many cultures, there's a norm that the higher earner should contribute more, but this can vary. If the boyfriend is okay with splitting everything equally despite the income gap, that's his choice, but others might see it as unfair. The girlfriend's friends' reaction indicates that societal norms in her circle might lean towards adjusting contributions based on income.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split despite the income difference. The answer hinges on whether splitting costs equally is fair when incomes are not equal. If fairness is measured by percentage of income, then the boyfriend is in the right because he's paying proportionally less. However, if fairness is about equal absolute amounts, then the higher earner might be expected to contribute more. The girlfriend's perspective, supported by her friends, is that the absolute split isn't fair given the income disparity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if the expectation is that contributions should be adjusted based on income. However, if they agree on 50/50 regardless, then it's their choice. The key is whether they can communicate and find a solution that both feel is fair. Since the girlfriend is upset and her friends think he's wrong, it might be that the author is in the wrong for not considering her financial situation.\n"
