I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy earning $80k, and his girlfriend is 23, making $45k. He wants her to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the main point is whether splitting costs 50/50 is fair given their income difference. The guy's argument is about equal contribution, but the girlfriend's side is that their incomes aren't equal. \n\nIn relationships, splitting costs can be a sensitive topic. Some people believe in splitting equally regardless of income because it's about fairness in the relationship. Others think it's better to split based on income to reflect each person's financial situation. \n\nThe author is suggesting a 50/50 split, which might not consider their different earnings. If the girlfriend earns less, she might find it harder to cover half the rent and utilities, especially if they're in a high-cost area. This could lead to her financial strain, which might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that splitting equally is fair since they're both living in the same space and using the same utilities. It's also common in many relationships to split expenses 50/50, so that's not inherently wrong. But the key here is the disparity in their incomes. If the girlfriend can't afford half, the author isn't considering her financial limitations, which could be the issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends reacting negatively suggests that the local norm might be different, maybe expecting a different split when there's a significant income difference. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting a 50/50 split if that's his expectation. The problem arises if the split creates an unfair burden on the lower-earning partner. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the 50/50 split is causing financial hardship for the girlfriend, then the author isn't considering her situation, which could be a mistake. But if they can both afford it, maybe it's okay. However, given the income difference, a 50/50 split might not be fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their income disparity when suggesting the split.\n"
