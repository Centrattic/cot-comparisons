I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting living costs 50/50. The author is a guy who rents a place by himself and wants his girlfriend to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries when she moves in. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unreasonable because he makes more money (80k vs her 45k). \n\nFirst, I need to consider standard practices for splitting costs in a shared living situation. Typically, people split expenses equally unless there's a specific reason not to, like significant differences in income. However, some people argue that when one person's income is much higher, they should contribute more to be fair.\n\nThe author's stance is 50/50, which he might see as fair because they're both living in the same space. But his girlfriend and her friends think he should pay more since he earns more. The key here is whether expecting equal splits despite income disparity is fair.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, it's common for the higher earner to take on a larger share. Others might split costs equally regardless. The girlfriend's friends' reactions suggest that in their social circle, income plays a role in splitting costs.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fairness. If the author is paying for a place he already rents alone, adding his girlfriend would mean splitting the existing costs. But does that justify a 50/50 split? Maybe not, because the original rent was his responsibility alone. If he's not upgrading the place, maybe she should pay half, but if the rent is the same, maybe the split is different. However, the user mentions he's moving downtown for a job, so the rent might be higher than if she were living elsewhere. But the main issue is the split based on income.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the author is being unfair by not considering their income difference. The friends agree with her. So, from her perspective, expecting her to pay half when he earns double might be seen as unfair. The question is whether the author is wrong in expecting an equal split despite the income gap.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might think that since she's moving in and using the space, she should contribute equally. But if the rent is already his, maybe she's just adding her share. However, if the total expenses are split, the higher earner might feel it's more equitable to contribute more. But if the place is already his, maybe the initial rent is his responsibility, and the girlfriend is paying for her portion. But splitting everything 50/50 regardless of income might not account for their financial situations.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs equally is common, but when there's a significant income disparity, some couples adjust the split to reflect that. The author's refusal to adjust might be seen as not considering her financial situation. However, if the place is his and he's not upgrading, maybe he's right to expect equal contribution. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nLooking at similar AITA cases, often the person is criticized for not being flexible in splits when there's a big income difference. The girlfriend's friends' reaction suggests that the author's stance is unpopular in her social circle. If the author is unwilling to negotiate, that could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not adjusting the split based on their income difference, which is a common consideration in such situations.\n"
