I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting living costs 50/50 when moving in together.\n\nThe guy (M22) wants to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. His girlfriend (F23) and her friends think he's being unreasonable, especially since he earns more (80k vs her 45k). The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, fairness in splitting costs often depends on individual circumstances. If both are contributing equally, that's one approach. But if their incomes differ, splitting 50/50 might not be fair. For example, if someone earns a lot more, they might be able to contribute a larger share without it being a burden. \n\nIn this case, the guy's income is significantly higher. If they split costs 50/50, the woman would be spending a larger portion of her income compared to him. That could be seen as unfair because financial responsibility often relates to one's ability to pay. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of equality in the relationship. The guy might feel that since they're sharing the space equally, they should split costs equally regardless of income. But that doesn't account for differing financial situations.\n\nThe woman's friends think he's being a \"douche\" or \"ass,\" which suggests there's a social norm they're applying here. But social norms can vary. Some people might argue that splitting 50/50 is fair if both are living in the same space, while others might think it's better to split according to income.\n\nAnother angle: moving in together is a big step. The guy might be trying to set boundaries, but if the approach feels unfair to the other person, it could cause conflict. Communication is key here. The guy's stance is clear, but he might not have considered her perspective or the income disparity enough.\n\nIn many relationships, couples adjust their contributions based on income to maintain balance. So expecting a 50/50 split when incomes are drastically different might not be fair. The woman's reaction could be valid because she's contributing a larger percentage of her earnings, which could strain her finances more.\n\nTherefore, the guy might be in the wrong (Answer A) because he's not considering the income difference, making the split unfair on her part. Alternatively, if he believes that splitting equally is fair regardless of income, it's a matter of perspective. But given the significant income gap, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
