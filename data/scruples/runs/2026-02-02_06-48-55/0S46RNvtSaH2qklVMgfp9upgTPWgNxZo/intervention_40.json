      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that he's making 80k a year, she's making 45k, and she's arguing that he's being unfair by making her pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on splitting costs in relationships. Many people argue that splitting equally isn't fair when there's a significant income disparity. The idea is that each person should contribute in a way that reflects their ability to pay. So if one person makes more, they might take on a larger share of expenses. Alternatively, some couples choose to split costs equally regardless of income, especially if they're in a committed relationship and view shared expenses as part of being together.\n\nIn this case, the GF feels that the 50/50 split is unfair given the income difference. Her friends also support her view, calling the author a \"douche\" and \"ass.\" The author's reasoning is that he's the one who has the place already, so he wants her to cover half. But maybe he's not considering that she can't afford to pay half, or that it's not fair to expect her to take such a big portion of her income to cover the costs. If he's making more, perhaps he should contribute more to the expenses. \n\nAnother angle is that they're moving in together for the first time, and the author's place is already rented. So he might be thinking of splitting the costs from the start, but that doesn't necessarily account for the income difference. If he's making almost double her income, expecting her to pay half might not be equitable. For example, if the rent is $2000 a month, she would need to pay $1000, which is a larger portion of her income compared to his $1000. That could create financial strain for her. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, especially a long-term one, splitting costs equally is fair because both are benefiting from the shared living arrangement. But the key here is the income disparity. If her income is significantly lower, expecting her to pay half could be seen as unfair, hence the friends' reactions. \n\nThe author's stance might be based on a literal 50/50 split without considering the financial realities. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not accounting for the income difference, which makes the split unequal in practical terms. Alternatively, if they agreed to a 50/50 split regardless of income, then it's not his fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for requesting it, given the income difference. The GF and her friends' reactions suggest that others see it as unfair. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering the income disparity when proposing an equal split, which could place an undue financial burden on his girlfriend. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
