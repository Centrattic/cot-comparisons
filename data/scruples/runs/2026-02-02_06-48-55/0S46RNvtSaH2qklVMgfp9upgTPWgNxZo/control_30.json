      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend is in the wrong. The guy is 22, she's 23, and they've been together a year and a half. He rents a place alone because he had to move for a job, and now she wants to move in. He wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She thinks he's being a jerk because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends agree with her.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider standard practices for splitting costs in a relationship. Typically, people split things 50-50 if they're both contributing equally, but income disparities might affect that. The guy's argument is that he's paying half of what he's already paying alone now. If they move in together, the total rent would be the same as his current rent, so splitting it 50-50 would mean each pays half of that. But if he's paying, say, $1,000 alone, then together they'd split $1,000, so each pays $500. That seems fair if they're sharing the space equally. However, she's making less money, so maybe she's not able to afford half? But that's her financial responsibility. \n\nWait, maybe the issue is that she's used to splitting costs based on income. If her income is lower, perhaps she expects to pay a smaller percentage. For example, in some relationships, couples split expenses proportionally to their income. So if he makes more, he pays a larger share. But the guy is asking for an equal split regardless of income. Is that fair? \n\nAnother angle: he's the one who owns the lease. If she moves in, is he the sole tenant, or is she added as a roommate? If the lease is only his name, then he's still responsible for the full rent, so she might be contributing to him as part of a shared living arrangement. But if they're both on the lease, then splitting equally makes sense. The question doesn't specify, but maybe that's a factor. \n\nAlso, the guy's reasoning is that he's covering the same total as before, so splitting it 50-50 is fair. But if he's already paying the full amount alone, then adding her means he's not saving anything. So he's expecting her to cover half of his existing expenses. That might come off as him not wanting to pay for her living there. But from his perspective, he's providing a place and wants her to contribute equally. \n\nIn terms of fairness, different people have different expectations. If they're in a committed relationship, maybe they expect to share expenses equally regardless of income. But if they're roommates, maybe splitting based on income is fairer. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Her friends think he is, but maybe that's because they don't consider his perspective. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and what's typical. In many relationships, splitting costs 50-50 is common unless there's a significant disparity. However, when there's a significant income difference, some couples adjust the split. But the guy isn't adjusting; he's asking for equal split. If he's making more, maybe he should be willing to pay a larger share, but that's a choice. He's not obligated to do so. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the expectation is that they split equally because they're a couple living together, then he's not wrong. However, if the expectation is that higher income means paying more, then he might be seen as not being fair. But the problem here is that the question is from his perspective, and he's asking if he's at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong. He's proposing a fair split of the costs, especially if they're moving into a shared space. The fact that his income is higher doesn't necessarily mean he should pay more unless they agree on a different arrangement. People have different expectations, and if he's clear about wanting a 50-50 split from the start, it's his right to set that boundary. Her friends' opinion might be biased, and the guy isn't wrong for wanting to split costs equally.\n"
