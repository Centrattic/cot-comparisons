      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place alone because he moved downtown for a job. His salary is $80k, and she's making $45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unfair. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, splitting costs equally can be a common approach, but it's not the only way. The key here is the difference in their incomes. He makes more, so expecting her to pay half might not be fair from her perspective. If they're in a relationship, splitting costs based on income could be a more equitable approach. For example, if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, their total income is 125k. So, maybe he covers a larger portion since he earns more. If they split everything 50/50 regardless of income, the person with the lower income might feel it's unfair because they're paying a higher percentage of their earnings.\n\nBut wait, maybe he's just trying to split it equally because the place is his. If he's the one who's renting it, maybe he's thinking that it's his responsibility to cover the rent, but he's open to her paying her share for other things. But the way he's phrased it is that she has to cover half of rent, utilities, and groceries. That could be an issue because if the apartment is his, maybe he's the one who's responsible for the rent as per the lease. Unless she's on the lease too. If she's not on the lease, she can't be expected to pay the rent. So maybe the confusion is about who is on the lease.\n\nAnother angle: splitting costs 50/50 without considering income disparities can be problematic. If he makes more, he might be able to afford a larger share. If she's paying 50% of the rent from her 45k salary, that's a bigger chunk of her income compared to his. That might be why her friends think he's being unfair. The concept of \"fair share\" isn't just about equal splitting but about what each person can afford.\n\nBut the user's approach here is to split everything equally. If that's what he wants, is it his right? Well, it's a discussion point in relationships. Communication is key. Maybe he should explain his reasoning, but he might not have considered her financial situation. The girlfriend might feel that since he earns more, he should contribute more. So, the author's stance might not be in the wrong, but his approach could be seen as not considering their income differences, leading to conflict.\n\nIn some relationships, splitting 50/50 is standard, but others split based on income. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to do a 50/50 split. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, expecting equal contribution without considering income can be seen as unfair. So maybe answer A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering their different earnings. But others might say that splitting equally is fair if they live together. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the apartment is his, and he's allowing her to move in, maybe he's the one who should cover the rent, and she covers utilities and groceries. That's another common approach. So if he's expecting her to pay half the rent, maybe that's where the issue is. If the apartment is his, she's not responsible for rent. So perhaps the author is wrong because he's expecting her to split rent which is his responsibility. That's a key point. If she's not on the lease, she can't be expected to pay rent. So maybe the author is wrong in that aspect. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
