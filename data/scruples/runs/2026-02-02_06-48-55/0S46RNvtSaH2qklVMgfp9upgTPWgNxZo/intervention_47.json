I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author, M22, is renting a place by himself since graduating and moving downtown for a job. His income is around $80k, while his girlfriend, F23, is making $45k. He's okay with her moving in, but wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable.\n\nI need to consider if splitting 50/50 is fair here. Their incomes are quite different\u2014$80k vs. $45k. That's a significant gap, so splitting expenses equally might not be equitable. Maybe the author is being inflexible without considering their different financial situations. \n\nIn many relationships, couples adjust their splitting of expenses based on income. For example, the person earning more might pay a larger share. The author's insistence on equal split despite income differences could be seen as not being considerate. His reasons might be about fairness, but if their incomes aren't equal, a 50/50 split could be burdensome for the girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends' opinion is that he's being a \"douche.\" While that's a judgment, it's based on the income disparity. The author might not be aware that this is a common consideration in shared expenses. He's asking for advice, so maybe he's expecting a discussion on fairness based on income. \n\nAnother angle: the author is in a new job, maybe he's paying for a place alone for the first time. He might not have experience with shared costs and is defaulting to equal split. But in reality, considering each other's financial capabilities is important. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because splitting based on income is more equitable, and being rigid on 50/50 without that consideration might not be fair.\n"
