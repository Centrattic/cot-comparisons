I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that he makes 80k and she makes 45k. He wants her to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common views on splitting costs in relationships. Some people split costs 50/50 regardless of income because it's about shared space and resources. Others think it should be based on income, so the higher earner pays more. The author's stance is 50/50, but his girlfriend and her friends see it as unfair because of their income difference.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, it depends on the agreement between the two people. If they had an understanding beforehand, then it's about their mutual agreement. But in this case, they didn't have an agreement yet. The author's reasoning is that it's fair because they both live there, but the girlfriend's perspective is about their different financial situations.\n\nThere's no universally right answer, but in many relationships, people adjust based on income. However, others prioritize splitting costs equally. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's his choice, but it's also understandable why his partner and her friends are upset. The key here is communication and mutual agreement. Since the author hasn't agreed to her paying less, but she's upset about it, maybe there's a need for discussion. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not being unreasonable in his stance, then maybe not. However, expecting someone with a lower income to pay half might be seen as unfair in some contexts. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author is stating his position, and if he's willing to communicate and find a middle ground, he's not necessarily wrong. But if he's being rigid without considering her situation, that's where the issue might be. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because it's his choice, but some might argue A. Hmm.\n"
