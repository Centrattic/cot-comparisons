I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that he's a guy who rents a place alone, making $80k, and his girlfriend makes $45k. She wants to move in together, and he's saying she has to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries. His GF and her friends think that's unfair because of the income difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Some people split costs equally regardless of income, while others adjust based on income. The author is asking for a 50/50 split, which is a common approach, but the issue here is the income disparity. \n\nThe author makes significantly more money than his girlfriend. If they split everything equally, the girlfriend would be contributing a larger percentage of her income compared to his. For example, if the rent is $2000, he's paying 25% of his income ($2000/80,000) while she's paying about 44% ($2000/45,000). That's a big difference. Typically, people might argue that higher earners should pay more to keep each person's financial burden proportional to their income.\n\nOn the other hand, splitting costs equally can be fair if both partners agree and if it works for both of them. Maybe he's not considering her financial situation, and that's where the conflict arises. His GF's friends also think he's being unreasonable, which might indicate that the community perceives his stance as unfair given the income gap.\n\nAnother angle is the reason for moving in together. If the place is already his, moving in together might mean he's providing the space, which could justify his desire for an equal split. However, if the cost is too high for her, it might not be sustainable, leading to future conflicts.\n\nI should also think about the relationship dynamics. The author is willing to let her move in, which is a big step, but his insistence on a 50/50 split despite the income difference could be seen as not being considerate of her financial situation. Relationships often require compromise, and being rigid on this issue might be the problem here.\n\nIn summary, while splitting costs equally is a valid approach, the significant income disparity makes the 50/50 split unequal in terms of financial strain on both parties. The author might be in the wrong for not adjusting the split to reflect their different earnings, leading to an unfair burden on his girlfriend.\n"
