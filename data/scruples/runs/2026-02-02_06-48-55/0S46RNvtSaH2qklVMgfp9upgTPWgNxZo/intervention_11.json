I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with their girlfriend. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years, the author is 22, making $80k, and the GF is 23, making $45k. The author wants to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on splitting costs in relationships. Some people believe in splitting 50/50 because it's fair, while others think it should be based on income. The author's GF and her friends think the author is being unfair because of the income difference. The author's argument is that it's a shared responsibility, hence 50/50. \n\nThe key point here is the income disparity. If both are contributing equally in percentage terms, the higher earner is effectively paying more in absolute terms. For example, if rent is $2000, the author's 50% is $1000, which is a smaller portion of their income compared to the GF's 50%, which is a larger chunk of hers. This could be seen as unfair from her perspective.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once you're living together, splitting costs equally is practical and avoids resentment. The author might not want to take on a larger financial burden, which could lead to future issues. But the GF and her friends see it as the higher earner contributing more, which is a common argument. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is setting boundaries early, which is good for a healthy relationship. But if it's causing conflict, maybe the approach needs adjustment. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. \n\nIn many discussions about splitting costs, the idea is that it should be proportional to income. So if the author is making more, they should pay a larger share. The author's insistence on 50/50 might be seen as not considering the income difference, hence being in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also the argument that splitting equally is simpler and fair in terms of equal responsibility. However, considering the income difference, the fairness in terms of financial burden is different. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's position might be seen as inconsiderate of the GF's financial situation, leading to answer A (author is in the wrong). However, others might side with the author. The majority opinion in such cases often leans towards proportional sharing based on income, so the answer could be A.\n"
