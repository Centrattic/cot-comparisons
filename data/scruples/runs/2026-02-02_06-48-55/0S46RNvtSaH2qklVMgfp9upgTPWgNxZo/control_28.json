I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a guy who's been with his girlfriend for 1.5 years. He's living alone and pays for everything by himself. Now she wants to move in together, and he wants her to split the costs 50-50. She thinks he's being unreasonable because he makes more money than she does. His friends even told her he's a douchbag for that. The guy is asking if he's the AITA (Asshole I Take It).\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is splitting the costs based on income. He wants 50/50, but she's making less. The common advice out there is that splitting costs equally isn't fair if incomes are different. So maybe the guy is wrong because he's not considering their different earnings. But then again, maybe he's just wanting to share the burden equally. \n\nWait, but 50/50 when one person earns significantly more might not be fair. Like, if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, maybe he should pay a larger share. The fact that his friends support his position is interesting. Maybe they don't consider income disparity. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the standard is to split costs based on income, then he's wrong. But if the standard is to split equally regardless, then he's not. \n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is 1.5 years. Moving in together is a major step. How they split expenses is a big part of that. Maybe the guy is being fair in wanting to share the costs, but not considering their financial situations. So the answer might hinge on whether it's about splitting equally or fairly. \n\nI think in most financial advice, splitting based on income is recommended. So if they both live there, maybe the rent is split based on income. But if he's already paying for the place by himself, maybe moving her in would mean splitting equally. However, if her income is lower, maybe he should take that into account. So the guy is suggesting 50/50 without considering income difference, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A. But wait, maybe not. Maybe in the context of a shared living space, it's reasonable to split costs equally, especially if they're both living there. But if he's the one who owns the place before she moves in, maybe he's already paying for it. Maybe he's asking her to chip in equally for the new arrangement. \n\nWait, the setup is that he's renting a place by himself since moving for a job. Now she wants to move in. So he's already paying for the place. If she moves in, he's not getting a discount on rent. So he's saying she needs to pay half. But if he's the one who's already paying for the apartment, maybe he's the one who's incurring the cost. But moving in together is a mutual decision. Maybe she's expecting him to cover all the costs because he's making more, but he wants her to contribute equally. \n\nThis is tricky. The key point is whether 50/50 is fair when their incomes are different. The general advice is that splitting costs proportionally to income is more equitable. So if he makes more, he pays more. Therefore, the guy's stance might be wrong because he's not considering their financial differences. So answer A. But maybe the guy is right because they're moving in together and both benefit equally from the space. Maybe splitting equally is fair if both are using the apartment. \n\nBut then again, if he's the one who already has the apartment and she's moving in, maybe it's different. Like, if he's the one who has the lease, he might be the primary tenant, and she's a roommate. So splitting rent and utilities equally would be standard in that scenario. Maybe that's just how roommates split costs. So then the guy isn't wrong because he's treating her like a roommate. \n\nBut the problem here is that their incomes are different. If he's making more, maybe he can afford to pay a larger share. But if they're just splitting as roommates, 50/50 is standard regardless of income. So maybe the guy is not wrong. However, if they're in a romantic relationship, maybe there's an expectation that the higher earner pays more. \n\nThis is a bit of a toss-up. In some cultures or relationships, splitting equally is the norm. In others, the person with higher income is expected to pay more. So the answer might depend on that. But given the context of the question, where the user is asking if he's the asshole, and his GF and her friends think he is, maybe the community would lean towards AITA being yes. But I need to make a judgment. \n\nConsidering that in many relationships, especially when moving in together, splitting costs based on income is considered fair. So if he's making more, he should pay more. Therefore, he's in the wrong by wanting 50/50. So answer A.\n"
