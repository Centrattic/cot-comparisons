      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe guy is 22, has been living alone since moving downtown for a job last June. His GF is 23. They've been together 1.5 years. She wants to move in together, and he's asking her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable, given their income difference\u2014his salary is $80k vs her $45k.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is that splitting costs 50/50 is fair. But income disparity might affect how fair that is. If they're sharing a place, maybe their contributions should reflect their incomes. For example, if he makes more, maybe he pays a larger portion. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to adjust the split based on income.\n\nThe common advice in cohabiting situations is that splitting costs equally can be unfair if incomes are unequal. So if he's making more, perhaps he should pay more. If he insists on 50/50 despite the income gap, he might be seen as not considering her financial situation. The girlfriend's friends support her view, which adds social proof. But the author's perspective is that it's a 50/50 arrangement regardless of income. \n\nBut in reality, splitting expenses equally might not be the most equitable approach when there's a significant income difference. The author's reasoning could be that they're both living in the same place and contributing equally, but that might not account for their different financial capacities. So if the GF can't afford half the rent, it's a problem. However, the author isn't considering her ability to pay; he's just insisting on splitting the costs equally. That might be where the issue lies.\n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other financially, and the higher earner might take on a larger share. But others might say that splitting equally is a fair way to ensure both are contributing their share, regardless of income. However, when there's a significant income difference, 50/50 might strain the lower-earning partner. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is not considering the income disparity, which could make the 50/50 split unfair for the GF. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not proposing a different arrangement that accounts for their different earnings. The key point is whether the split is fair given their incomes. If the GF can't afford half, then the author's approach is problematic. But if she can, maybe not. However, since she's objecting and her friends support her, it suggests that she might not be able to afford it. So the answer would be A (author in the wrong).\n"
