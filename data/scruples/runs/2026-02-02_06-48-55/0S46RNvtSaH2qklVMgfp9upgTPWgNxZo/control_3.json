I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the man is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. He's 22, she's 23, and they've been together 1.5 years. He's renting alone since moving for a job last June, making $80k this year. She makes $45k. She wants to move in together, and he said she needs to cover half the rent, utilities, groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether splitting costs equally is fair. The man's income is significantly higher. Splitting 50/50 might not be fair if their incomes are different. Typically, splitting based on income might be more equitable. But some couples do split 50/50 regardless. The issue here is that his GF and her friends think he's wrong. \n\nThe man's reasoning is that he wants to split costs evenly. But if he earns double hers, paying the same amount could mean he's contributing a smaller percentage of his income. For example, if rent is $2000/month, he's paying 10% of his income ($2000/20000) and she's paying about 22% ($2000/9000). That's a big difference. So from a fairness perspective, maybe he's not in the wrong if they agree on 50/50, but if the alternative is splitting based on income, then maybe he is. But the problem is, the question is whether he's in the wrong based on societal norms or typical expectations.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting 50/50 is common, especially if both are contributing to the household. However, when there's a significant income disparity, it's often considered more fair to split based on income. But the man's stance is that he wants 50/50 regardless. His GF and her friends think that's unfair because of the income difference. So the conflict is between two approaches: equal contribution vs. proportional to income.\n\nThe user is asking if the man is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural context and what's considered fair. In some contexts, 50/50 is standard, but when incomes differ, it's seen as unfair. The man's reasoning is straightforward, but the GF's friends think he's wrong. So, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong if both agree, but if the GF feels it's unfair due to income, then maybe he is. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The GF's perspective and friends' opinion suggest he is, but others might say it's up to mutual agreement. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because 50/50 when incomes are unequal is often seen as unfair. But others might argue that it's a personal choice. Need to weigh these factors.\n"
