I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. The situation is that he's making $80k, she's making $45k, and the girlfriend and her friends think he's being a jerk by expecting her to pay half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general norms around splitting costs in a relationship. Often, people split things equally regardless of income, but some argue it's more equitable to split based on income. However, when moving in together, it's common to split expenses 50/50 as a matter of fairness in the living arrangement, not necessarily income. But income can play a role in what each person can afford.\n\nThe key points here are the income disparity and the expectation of equal payment. The author is asking if it's reasonable to expect a 50/50 split regardless of income. The girlfriend's friends think he's wrong, so there's a social judgment here. But is there a right or wrong answer?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both are contributing to the household expenses equally, that could be seen as fair. However, considering their incomes, his higher income might mean he can afford to contribute more. But in a shared living situation, each person pays for their own expenses. So if they're splitting the rent and utilities, it's a shared cost of living together. \n\nBut maybe there's an assumption here that because he's the one who owns the place, he should cover more. The question is whether it's right to expect her to pay half. If he's renting the place by himself, then adding someone else would mean splitting the cost. But perhaps the initial rent was his alone, so adding a roommate (his girlfriend) would make sense for him to split the cost. However, if the rent goes up when she moves in, that's another factor.\n\nAnother angle: some people argue that splitting 50/50 is fair because they're both living there. Others think it's better to split based on income, so the person with higher income pays more. The girlfriend's friends think he's being unreasonable, which might indicate that in her social circle, splitting based on income is more accepted. However, the author's expectation might be based on wanting equal contribution to the shared household.\n\nBut then, if he's already paying the rent alone, and she moves in, he's splitting with her. It's his place, so maybe he's not wrong to expect her to contribute half. But if the place is being kept for his job, maybe he's the primary occupant and should pay more. But that's not clear here.\n\nI think the main issue is whether 50/50 is fair regardless of income. If they're both living there, splitting equally makes sense. However, if one person is significantly higher income, some might argue they should pay more. But the author is not asking for a proportional split, just 50/50. \n\nSo, is 50/50 fair here? The girlfriend and her friends think not because of the income difference. The author's perspective is that they're sharing the space equally. It's a common point of contention. Without more context, like whether the rent increases, or if there's any other factors, it's hard to say. But in general, many couples split costs equally regardless of income unless they agree otherwise. However, others believe in splitting based on income. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting 50/50. If the norm in their culture or social group is to split based on income, then maybe he is. But if 50/50 is the norm for roommates, then he's not. The answer could depend on societal expectations, but the girlfriend's friends' reaction suggests that in her circle, he's wrong. However, the author's reasoning is that they're splitting the costs because they're both living there. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether splitting equally is acceptable regardless of income. If the author is not taking into account the income disparity, maybe he's in the wrong because it could place a heavier burden on her. But if it's a shared living arrangement, splitting equally is fair. \n\nSo, in the end, there's no absolute right or wrong, but the author could be in the wrong if the expectation is to split based on income. However, if the expectation is to split equally because of shared living, then he's not in the wrong. Given the girlfriend's friends' reaction, and the income difference, maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because considering the income disparity, expecting a 50/50 split might not be equitable. However, if they had discussed it beforehand and agreed, it's different. Since the girlfriend feels it's unfair and her friends agree, it's possible that the author is in the wrong here.\n"
