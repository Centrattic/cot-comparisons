      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and the girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. The author rents a place by himself since he graduated and moved downtown for a job. The girlfriend wants to move in together, and the author wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. The girlfriend thinks it's a huge dick move because the guy makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also said the author is a jerk for this.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The key points here are about fairness in splitting costs when partners have different incomes. The author wants a 50/50 split regardless of income. The girlfriend and her friends see this as unfair because he earns more. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs equally can be a standard approach, especially if both partners are contributing equally to the shared living space. However, when there's a significant income disparity, some people argue that the higher earner should contribute more to support the relationship or because they can afford to. Others believe that splitting costs equally is fair because it's about equal contribution to shared expenses, not about individual earnings.\n\nThe author's reasoning might be that since they're living together, the costs should be split equally. The girlfriend's perspective is that since he earns more, he should pay a larger share. The friends supporting her view might think that the higher earner should subsidize the relationship more, which is a common argument in such situations.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how long they've been together. 1.5 years isn't that long, and moving in together is a big step. The girlfriend might feel that expecting her to pay half is unfair because her income is lower, which could affect her financial stability or future savings. The author, on the other hand, might see it as fair since they're sharing the space equally.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being considerate. If he's asking her to pay half of everything, maybe he's not considering her financial situation. The girlfriend's income is $45k, which might be tight if she's also saving or has other expenses. If moving in together means her share of the rent is a significant portion of her income, that could be a problem. But the author's income is higher, so he might be able to handle a larger share without as much strain.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and what's considered fair. In some cultures, splitting costs equally is standard, while others adjust based on income. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since they're both adults and moving in together, agreeing on a fair split is important. If the author is insisting on 50/50 despite the income difference, some might see that as not considering her financial situation. Others might see it as fair because they're sharing the space equally.\n\nThe friends' opinion that the author is a douche suggests that in their view, the higher earner should contribute more. But if the author is okay with splitting everything 50/50, that's his stance. The problem is whether his stance is the right one. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the girlfriend's share would be a financial burden due to her lower income, then the author's approach might be seen as unfair. However, if they both agree that splitting equally is fair, then it's not necessarily wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the author is being inflexible or not considering her ability to pay. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the girlfriend's side is that it's unfair because of income disparity, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) if the split is causing her financial strain. But if they view it as equal contribution regardless of income, then B (not in the wrong). The friends' opinion adds weight to the A side. However, the author's reasoning isn't necessarily wrong if they both agree. But since the girlfriend is objecting and the friends back her up, maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
