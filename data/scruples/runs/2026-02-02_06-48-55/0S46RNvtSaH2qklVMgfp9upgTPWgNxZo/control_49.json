      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (M22) is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself because he moved downtown for a job after graduating. She wants to move in together. He's offering a 50/50 split on rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong. There's no clear right or wrong here, but societal norms and fairness in relationships often come into play. \n\nOne angle: Splitting costs 50/50 regardless of income is common among couples. It's practical because they're sharing the space equally. But another angle is that splitting based on income might be fairer. If he makes more, maybe he could pay a larger share. However, the author hasn't done that; he's insisting on equal split. \n\nHer friends' reaction suggests that in their circle, a 50/50 split is not the norm. Maybe they expect the higher earner to contribute more. But the author might argue that the apartment is his, so he's allowing her to move in, so he's already giving her a break.\n\nBut wait, if he's renting the place himself and then inviting her to move in, maybe the original rent was just for him. Now, with two people living there, the cost increases, so splitting equally makes sense. However, if utilities and groceries are also split, that's a shared expense based on usage. Maybe she's paying for her own usage, but if she's moving in, she's contributing to the overall costs. \n\nBut the issue here is the perception. She might feel that since he makes more, he should pay more. However, the author is setting a boundary that he's not willing to subsidize her living costs. But insisting on 50/50 when she's making less could be seen as unfair because he's taking a larger portion of the combined income to pay the same amount. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe, because fairness can be subjective. If they're in a committed relationship, splitting based on income might be more equitable. But if it's more of a roommates situation, 50/50 is standard. \n\nAnother point: He's the one who owns the apartment. If he's allowing her to move in, he might be the one making a bigger sacrifice by splitting with someone else. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if they're in a relationship, expecting her to pay half could be seen as expected, but maybe not considering the income disparity. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether splitting costs equally in this scenario is fair. If the apartment is his, and she's moving in, perhaps he could adjust the split. For example, he could keep a larger portion of the rent based on his salary. But he's not doing that. So maybe he is being unfair because he's not taking into account their different incomes. \n\nAlternatively, if they're splitting the costs equally, and he's allowing her to live in his place, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's not making her pay more than half. But the fact that he makes more and she's expected to pay half might lead to her feeling the burden is unequal. \n\nIn some relationships, splitting by income is considered fair, but in others, 50/50 is standard. The problem arises when there's a significant income difference. So, if he's okay with splitting 50/50 regardless, he's not wrong, but if the couple's agreement is different, that's an issue. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms. In some places, splitting 50/50 is the norm, and income isn't considered. In others, it's expected to split according to income. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and her friends think he is, maybe the societal expectation here is that with a significant income difference, splitting based on income is more appropriate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not adjusting the split. \n\nBut another way: If the apartment is his, and she's moving in, they're sharing the space equally. So splitting 50/50 is fair. His income is higher, but that's separate from the living arrangement. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer could go either way. But considering that the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the majority of people might think that expecting equal split when there's a large income difference is unfair, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But others might say it's his apartment and he's allowing her to move in, so he's not wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not considering the income disparity. If the couple is in a long-term relationship, splitting based on income is more equitable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being flexible and expecting a 50/50 split regardless of their financial situations. So answer A.\n"
