I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for a year and a half. He's renting a place alone since moving downtown for a job after graduating. His income is $80k, and her income is $45k. He wants her to cover half of rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable, calling him a \"douche\" and an \"ass.\"\n\nFirst, the key points here are the income disparity and the expectation of equal splitting. The author is making significantly more than his girlfriend. In many relationships, splitting costs equally can be fair if both are contributing proportionally to their means. However, when there's a big income difference, a 50/50 split might not account for each person's financial situation.\n\nIf both are paying the same percentage of their income, maybe it's fairer. For example, if he pays 30% and she pays 30%, that might be better than splitting the actual dollar amount. The problem here is that he's asking her to pay half the dollar amount, which, given her lower income, might be a larger burden.\n\nAlso, considering they're moving in together, maybe there's a need for a more flexible arrangement. Factors like who owns the furniture, who pays for what, or how expenses are divided based on usage (like utilities) could matter. The author's stance seems rigid, not considering the income difference. His GF's friends agreeing with her suggests that he's being unfair in the eyes of others.\n\nBut then again, wanting to split costs 50/50 isn't inherently wrong. If both agree beforehand, it's a mutual decision. However, when one party has a significantly lower income, expecting an equal split without considering the financial impact could be seen as unreasonable. The author might not be considering her financial capability, which could lead to her stress or inability to cover her share, causing relationship strain.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on fairness relative to their incomes. Since he's making more, expecting her to pay half in absolute terms might not be fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the income disparity and proposing a split that could be burdensome for his girlfriend. The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe he's just trying to be fair upfront, but the way he's doing it isn't considering her financial situation. So, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
