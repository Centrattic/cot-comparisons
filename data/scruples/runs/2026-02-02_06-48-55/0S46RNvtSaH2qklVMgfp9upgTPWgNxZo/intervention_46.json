I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy, M22, is renting a place by himself and makes $80k, while the girlfriend, F23, makes $45k. He wants her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider common norms around splitting costs in a relationship. Typically, when couples move in together, they might split expenses based on income, or 50-50 if they can afford it. But here, their incomes are different. The guy earns more, so maybe expecting her to pay half could be seen as unfair if she can't afford it. But he's also paying rent on his own now. If they move in, he might be reducing his own expenses, so maybe he's justified in wanting her to contribute equally. However, if her income is significantly lower, expecting her to pay half might be a financial burden on her. \n\nI should also think about communication. The guy's approach is to insist on 50-50 without considering her financial situation. Maybe he should have been more flexible, like splitting based on income. The girlfriend's friends agreeing that he's in the wrong might indicate that the community sees this as unfair. But maybe the guy's reasoning is that he's moving her in, so he should split equally. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the expectation of 50-50 without considering income disparity could be problematic. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong). But others might say it's fair since they're sharing a home.\n"
