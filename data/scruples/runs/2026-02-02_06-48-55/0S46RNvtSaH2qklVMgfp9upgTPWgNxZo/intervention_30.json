I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the guy is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. He makes $80k a year, and his girlfriend makes $45k. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting expenses when couples live together. Some people split equally, others split based on income. The guy wants 50/50, which is a common approach, but his higher income might be a factor here. \n\nIf they both are contributing 50%, the girl's share might be a larger portion of her income compared to his. Let's do some math. If the total is, say, $2000 a month for rent, utilities, and groceries, the guy is paying $1000, which is 1.25% of his income ($80k/yr is about $6,666 a month), so $1000 is 15%. The girl's $1000 would be about 22.2% of her monthly income ($45k/yr is $3,750/month). That's a bigger chunk for her. \n\nSo maybe the problem is that a flat 50/50 split might not be fair considering their different incomes. Some argue that splitting based on income proportion is more equitable. In that case, the guy's share would be higher. For example, if total expenses are $2000, and his share is (80k/(80k+45k)) = 64%, so he'd pay $1280 and she pays $720. That might be more balanced in terms of each paying a similar percentage of their income.\n\nThe guy's friends might be thinking that 50/50 is standard, but the girl and her friends see it as unfair because she's paying a larger percentage of her income. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not considering the income disparity. However, others might say that when you live together, you both contribute equally regardless of income. \n\nBut given the context, the girl's financial situation is more strained. The author's request could be seen as not taking her financial capacity into account. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But I need to check if there's any other factors. The duration of the relationship isn't that long, maybe 1.5 years. But that's not necessarily relevant. \n\nAnother angle: splitting costs equally can be fair if both are making a joint decision to live together. But if one's income is significantly lower, the higher earner might be expected to contribute more. The key is whether the split is fair given their circumstances. Since the author isn't adjusting for income, he might be in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
