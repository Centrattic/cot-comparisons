I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy making $80k, and his girlfriend is 23, making $45k. He's currently renting alone and wants her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries if she moves in with him. The girlfriend and her friends think it's unfair, given their income disparity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Some couples split expenses equally regardless of income, while others split based on proportion. The key factors here are their earnings and the fairness perception.\n\nThe author's reasoning is to split costs 50/50, which is a common approach. However, his income is significantly higher than his girlfriend's. If they live together, he's making about 177% more than she is. A 50/50 split might mean he's contributing more in absolute terms relative to his income, which could be seen as unfair to her because she's paying a larger percentage of her income. \n\nIn many relationships, especially those where there's a significant income difference, people adjust the split to reflect their earnings. For example, a proportional split would mean the higher earner pays a larger share. The girlfriend's friends also support the idea that the author is being unreasonable, which might indicate that the community perceives a 50/50 split as unfair when incomes are unequal.\n\nHowever, if the couple values equality in shared living, they might still prefer splitting 50/50. The author's stance could be based on wanting his girlfriend to feel equal in the partnership. But if the financial burden is disproportionate, it could lead to resentment.\n\nThe author's approach might not consider the financial strain on his girlfriend. Paying half of the rent and utilities would take up a larger portion of her income. For instance, if the rent is $2000, each would pay $1000. For the author, that's 12.5% of his income, but for her, it's about 22.2%, which is a bigger chunk. This discrepancy could be seen as unfair because she's contributing a higher percentage of her earnings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the expectation is equal contribution by percentage, then he might be wrong to not adjust for income differences. If the expectation is equal contribution by amount, then he's not wrong. However, in most financial advice, splitting expenses proportionally to income is often recommended when there's a significant disparity.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering the proportional burden on his girlfriend. The answer would be A (Yes). But if the community values equality over proportionality, maybe B. But given the context and common advice, A is more likely.\n"
