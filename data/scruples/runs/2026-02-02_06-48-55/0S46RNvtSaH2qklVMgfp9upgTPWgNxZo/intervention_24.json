I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that the guy (M22) rents a place by himself and wants his GF (F23) to pay half of rent, utilities, and groceries if they move in together. She's making $45k vs his $80k, and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common norms around splitting costs in a relationship. I know that splitting costs 50/50 isn't always the standard. Some people split based on income, while others have different arrangements. The key factors here are income disparity and the reasonableness of the request.\n\nThe guy's income is significantly higher than his girlfriend's. If they move in together, it's common for the higher earner to contribute more, especially if it's a fair distribution relative to their earnings. For example, if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, their combined income is 125k. So, splitting the costs 50/50 might not be equitable because he's earning more. The girlfriend's friends likely think the guy is being unreasonable because he's not considering their income difference.\n\nHowever, the guy might argue that he's paying for the apartment by himself now and wants to split the cost to make it fair once she moves in. But if he's already paying for the place alone and she's not contributing anything now, then moving in together and splitting 50/50 might still not account for their income. He could propose that he covers a larger portion based on his higher income, which might be seen as fairer.\n\nAnother angle is that when people move in together, it's not just about splitting costs equally but about shared expenses. If the apartment is in his name and he's the one who took on the lease, maybe he's entitled to some consideration. But generally, moving in together is a mutual decision, and expecting equal split regardless of income can be seen as not considering the other person's financial situation.\n\nSo, if the guy is insisting on 50/50 without considering their income difference, that could be where he's in the wrong. His girlfriend's friends' reaction suggests that splitting 50/50 isn't the norm in their view, especially with such a disparity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible and not considering their different incomes.\n"
