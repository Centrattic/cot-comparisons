      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He's living alone since moving downtown for a job last June. Now she wants to move in together, and he's asking her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also called him a \"douche\" and an \"ass\" for wanting a 50/50 split.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is the fairness of splitting costs based on income. The author is proposing a 50/50 split regardless of their earnings. His income is almost double hers. So if they split everything equally, he's contributing more in absolute terms, but maybe not in proportion to their incomes. \n\nIn relationships, splitting costs can be a sensitive topic. Some people believe that splitting based on income is fairer because it accounts for each person's financial situation. Others think that splitting equally is fairer because it's about equal responsibility for the shared space. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that since he earns more, he should contribute more. Her friends seem to agree with that. The author, however, might think that since they're living together, it's logical to split the costs equally. But if he's making twice as much, maybe a 50/50 split would mean her paying a larger percentage of her income. For example, if the rent is $2000, he's paying $1000 (which is 1.25% of his $80k income) and she's paying $1000 (which is 2.2% of her $45k income). That's not equal in terms of proportion. So she might be contributing more relative to her earnings.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's the one who owns the place already, maybe he's already set up there and she's joining him. So maybe he expects her to share the costs equally because they're both living there. But if he's the one who has the place first, maybe he should take on a larger share of the costs. It's a common debate in relationships. \n\nThe key question is whether the 50/50 split is fair when their incomes are so different. The girlfriend and her friends think he's in the wrong because he's making more and expecting her to pay the same. The author might think it's fair because they're sharing the space equally. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people argue that splitting based on income is more equitable, especially if the couple is in a long-term committed relationship. Others say that splitting equally is fair because it's about equal contribution to the household. \n\nSince the author is the one who is making more, expecting a 50/50 split might be seen as not considering their different financial situations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not accounting for the income disparity, leading to an unequal financial burden on his girlfriend. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). However, there's a counterargument that if they're both using the space equally, splitting 50/50 is fair regardless of income. But given the context and common advice on splitting costs in relationships, the fair approach is often to adjust based on income. Hence, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
