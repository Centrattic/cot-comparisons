      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since graduating and moving downtown for a job. The GF wants to move in together, and he's proposing splitting rent, utilities, and groceries 50/50. She's upset because he makes $80k and she makes $45k. Her friends also think he's being a jerk.\n\nI need to consider common perspectives on splitting costs in relationships. There's the idea of splitting costs equally versus proportionally based on income. The guy wants 50/50 regardless of income, while the girlfriend and her friends argue that since he earns more, he should pay a larger share. \n\nIn many relationships, people do split things 50/50 regardless of income because it's seen as fairer in terms of effort and space. But others argue that higher earners should contribute more to support the lower-earning partner, especially if they're in a long-term relationship. \n\nThe guy's reasoning is that they're sharing the space and responsibilities equally, so costs should be split equally. The girlfriend's side is that income disparity makes 50/50 unfair because he can afford it more. \n\nIs there a right answer here? It's subjective, but from a financial fairness perspective, expecting equal contributions when incomes are unequal might be seen as less fair. However, if the relationship is equal in other aspects, maybe splitting costs equally is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the guy is still quite young (22), and maybe he hasn't considered that their financial situations might change. The girlfriend's friends' opinions add weight to the idea that he's being insensitive by not considering their income difference. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author considered his girlfriend's perspective. If he's insisting on 50/50 without considering their income difference, that might come off as not being considerate. However, if they both agree that splitting equally is fair to them, then it's okay. The fact that the girlfriend's friends are against it suggests that the author might not be in the right here. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because insisting on equal split without considering income differences can be seen as unfair, especially when there's a significant disparity. The girlfriend's argument and her friends' support indicate that the author's approach is not the norm in such situations.\n"
