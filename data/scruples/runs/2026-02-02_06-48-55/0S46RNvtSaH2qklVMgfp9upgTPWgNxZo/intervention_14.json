I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting living costs 50/50 when moving in together. The guy (M22) wants to split rent, utilities, and groceries equally. His girlfriend (F23) and her friends think he's being unfair because he earns more\u2014$80k vs. her $45k.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is whether a 50/50 split is reasonable when their incomes are different. I remember that in relationships, splitting expenses equally isn't always fair if one person makes significantly more. The key factors here are the difference in income, the specific expenses, and cultural norms or expectations.\n\nFirst, the guy is making nearly double what his girlfriend is. A 50/50 split might not account for their differing financial situations. If they have similar expenses, the one with higher income should contribute more. Groceries might be a bit different because they both use them, but rent and utilities are fixed costs of the living space. If the guy owns the place already, moving her in might mean he's giving her a place to live without increasing his rent, so maybe splitting those equally isn't right. But if they're moving into a new place together, the 50/50 split might still be expected unless they agree otherwise.\n\nHowever, in many relationships, splitting costs proportionally to income is considered fairer. So if he makes 80k and she makes 45k, their total is 125k. So he would cover 64% and she 36% of the expenses. But maybe that's too complicated. Some people just split things 50/50 regardless, maybe because it's easier or they value equality in the relationship. But if the income difference is large, the higher earner might feel the other isn't contributing enough, or the lower earner might feel it's unfair to pay the same as someone who earns more.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends called him a douche, which suggests that in their social circle, expecting equal payment despite income difference is seen as unreasonable. But maybe the guy's perspective is that he's covering more of the expenses by his own contribution, so he's not expecting her to pay the same absolute amount. However, the way he phrased it is \"she'd have to cover half,\" which might not consider her ability to pay.\n\nAnother angle: if he already lives there and she's joining him, maybe he's not increasing his rent, so it's fair for him to take a larger share of the cost. For example, if the rent is $2000, and he's already paying $1000 for his own place, moving in together might not increase his rent. So splitting it 50/50 would mean he's paying $1000, but he's only saving $0 (since he's already paying that), while she's paying $1000 for a room. That seems unfair to her because she's paying the same as he was for a place he already has. In that case, he should cover more. But if they're moving into a new place together, maybe that's different.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to consider if the author's approach is unreasonable. The answer depends on the context of how they're splitting the costs. If they're moving into a new place together, 50/50 might be standard. But if he's already living there and she's joining, then expecting her to pay 50% might not be fair since he's getting the benefit of not increasing his rent. But the question doesn't specify if they're moving into a new place or him adding her to his current lease. The original statement says he's renting a place by himself since moving downtown for a job last June. Now the GF wants to move in. So if he's already paying for the apartment, and she moves in, the rent might stay the same, so he's not paying more. Therefore, expecting her to pay half of the rent, utilities, and groceries would mean she's covering all the additional costs, which might be fair. But if the total rent is, say, $2000, and he's already paying that alone, adding her would mean splitting $2000. So he's paying $1000 and she pays $1000, but he's still living in the same place as before. So he's not paying any more than before, while she's paying half. Then groceries would be split. That might be fair because he's not increasing his own expenses, but she's contributing. But since he's making more, maybe he should cover more of the combined expenses. \n\nWait, but if they split the rent and utilities 50/50, and he's already paying the full amount before, then he's saving money by having her pay half. So maybe it's fair. But the problem is that his income is higher. Maybe the girlfriend feels that even though she's paying half, her income is lower, so she's contributing a larger percentage of her income compared to him. For example, if rent is $2000, she pays $1000, which is about 22% of her $45k income (assuming $1000/month is about $12k/year). His $1000 is about 15% of his $80k income. So she's paying a higher percentage, which might be unfair. So splitting based on income would make sense here. \n\nIn that case, the author's approach is not considering their different income levels, leading to an unfair split for the girlfriend. Hence, he might be in the wrong. The friends' reactions support that. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
