My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs. The situation is that the author (M22) and his girlfriend (F23) have been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place alone since moving for a job, earning about $80k, and she makes $45k. She wants to move in together, and he's insisting she covers half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a \"douche\" or \"ass\" for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in splitting costs when couples live together. Some couples split costs 50/50 regardless of income, others split based on income percentages. The author's stance is on equal division, while she might expect a different arrangement considering their income difference. \n\nIs it fair to split everything 50/50 if one partner earns significantly more? If the higher-earning partner is willing to pay more to ease the financial burden on the lower-earning partner, that could be seen as fairer. However, if both agree that splitting evenly is acceptable, then it's their choice. The key here is mutual agreement. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's contributing half, but since he makes more, she might be arguing that he should contribute a larger share. The fact that her friends support her view might indicate that societal norms or expectations in their context favor splitting based on income. \n\nBut is the author obligated to pay more? If they're in a committed relationship, it's common for partners to adjust their financial contributions based on their means. However, if both are comfortable with the 50/50 split, that's their right. The problem arises if one feels it's unfair but the other insists.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether insisting on 50/50 despite a significant income disparity is unreasonable. If the author is unwilling to negotiate and the partner is uncomfortable, then maybe he is being inconsiderate. But if they can agree on terms, then it's not the author's fault.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is making his expectations clear, but if the partner is not willing to meet halfway (literally in this case), that's an issue. Alternatively, the author could propose a different split based on income, like 60/40, which might be more equitable given their earnings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer depends on whether the 50/50 split is fair given their incomes. If the author is rigid on this and refuses to adjust, he might be in the wrong. However, if they are both okay with it, then it's their choice. The problem here is that the GF's friends and she think he's being unfair, suggesting that in their social circle, the expectation is different. Therefore, the author's position might be seen as unreasonable, making him in the wrong.\n"
