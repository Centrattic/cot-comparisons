I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that a guy, M22, is renting a place by himself and wants his girlfriend, F23, to move in. He wants her to split the living costs 50/50, including rent, utilities, and groceries. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unreasonable because he makes more money than she does\u2014$80k vs. $45k. The question is whether he's wrong for wanting an equal split regardless of income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on splitting costs when roommates or partners move in together. Generally, people split costs equally if they're both contributing to the household, regardless of income. However, some might argue that the person with a higher income should pay a larger share. But this can vary based on cultural norms, personal agreements, and the specific circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the man is offering a 50/50 split, which is a common and fair approach in many situations. The fact that he's making more money doesn't necessarily mean he should pay more unless there's an agreement otherwise. The girlfriend's friends are calling him a douche because he's not adjusting the split based on income. But traditionally, even if one person earns more, splitting expenses equally is acceptable if both are contributing. For example, if one person's income is significantly higher but they're both living in the same space and using the same utilities, splitting equally is fair. The man's stance isn't inherently wrong unless there's a specific reason to adjust the split. However, the woman's perspective is that he's not considering their income disparity, which is a valid concern too. \n\nBut the key here is that the man is asking for a 50/50 split, which is a standard approach. Unless there's an agreement to adjust based on income, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's friends labeling him as a douche seems harsh if the split is equal and both are contributing. So the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because wanting an equal split is reasonable, and the criticism from her friends isn't justified unless there's more context. However, it's also possible that in some relationships, people adjust expenses based on income, but the man's approach isn't the default wrong one here.\n"
