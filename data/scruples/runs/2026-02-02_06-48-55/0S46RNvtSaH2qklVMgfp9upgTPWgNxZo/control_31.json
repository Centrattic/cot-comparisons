I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50. The author is a 22-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 23, and they've been together for 1.5 years. He's renting a place by himself since moving downtown for a job. She wants to move in together, and he's proposing a 50/50 split on rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable because he makes $80k and she makes $45k.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices regarding splitting costs when roommates or couples live together. Typically, splitting costs equally is common, especially if both are living in the same space. However, income differences can complicate things. The author's income is higher, but if they're both using the same amount of space and resources, a 50/50 split might be fair. But some might argue that the higher earner should contribute more, especially if there's a significant income disparity.\n\nBut in this case, the author is the one who owns the place. Wait, no, he's renting. So when she moves in, they're roommates. The rent is for a place he's already renting, so adding her as a roommate means splitting the costs. But maybe the original rent was his alone. Now that she's moving in, the total expenses might increase if they're splitting the existing rent. However, if the apartment's size or utilities usage doesn't change, splitting the costs equally makes sense.\n\nBut the girlfriend's friends think he's in the wrong. They might be influenced by the income difference. However, fairness in splitting costs isn't necessarily about income. It's about usage and benefit. If they both live there, share the space, and use the same utilities, then splitting equally is fair regardless of income. Unless there's a different arrangement they agreed upon, like one person covering rent while the other handles other bills, but the author wants equal split on all.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the author is being unreasonable because he's making more. But in many cases, especially among roommates, people split costs equally regardless of income. The idea that the higher earner should pay more is a personal choice, not a rule. However, if the girlfriend can't afford half, that's a problem. But she didn't mention inability; she just said it's a \"huge dick move\" because of the income difference. Her friends agree with her, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If splitting equally is the norm they agreed upon, then he's not wrong. But if the girlfriend feels it's unfair due to income, maybe they need a different arrangement. However, the author isn't forcing her; he's giving her the option to move in under this split. If she doesn't agree, she can choose not to move in. Since he's the one who owns the place (or renting it), he has the right to set the terms. So unless there's a cultural expectation or prior agreement, he's not in the wrong.\n"
