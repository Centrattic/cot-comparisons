I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with their girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place alone since moving for a job, making $80k a year, while she makes $45k. She wants to move in together, and he wants her to pay half the rent, utilities, and groceries. Her friends and she think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. Let me break it down. The main issue is splitting costs down the middle regardless of income. The author is making significantly more money. If both pay 50%, the higher earner is contributing more in absolute terms. But traditionally, some might argue that splitting 50/50 is fair because each is paying the same percentage. However, others might say it's unfair because the person earning less is contributing a larger portion of their income.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends think the author is being a jerk. That could indicate a common perspective, but I shouldn't rely solely on that. The key is whether the author is in the wrong here. If they are in a committed relationship and plan to stay together, splitting costs based on income might be more equitable. For example, if the rent is $2000, the author could cover $1200 and his girlfriend $800, keeping the split proportional to their incomes. However, the author is insisting on 50/50, not considering income disparity.\n\nBut maybe the author is not wrong if they're both renting a place they can afford together. If the total costs are within each of their budgets, then maybe it's okay. However, since she's making less, paying half of $2000 would take up more of her income. For instance, if her rent portion is half her income, that's 44%, which is high. His portion would be 25%, which is more manageable. So from a financial responsibility standpoint, splitting 50/50 might not be fair here.\n\nAnother angle: moving in together is a big step. Expectations can vary. The girlfriend might expect the higher earner to contribute more, which is common in many relationships. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible, not considering their different financial situations. So, the question is whether insisting on equal percentages is fair when their incomes are unequal.\n\nIn many relationships, people adjust contributions based on individual circumstances. So, the author's refusal to consider a different split could be seen as selfish or not considering her financial situation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But if they agreed beforehand to split equally regardless of income, then maybe not. However, there's no mention of prior agreement here. The girlfriend is bringing it up now, and he's setting the terms.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the author is insisting on a 50/50 split without considering their differing incomes. That could be the issue. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not accounting for the income difference, making the split unfair to the lower earner.\n"
