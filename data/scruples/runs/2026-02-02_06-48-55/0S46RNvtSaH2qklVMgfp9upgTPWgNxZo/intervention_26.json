I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a 50/50 split on living costs with his girlfriend. The situation is that they've been together for 1.5 years, and the guy is renting a place by himself since moving for a job. He makes $80k, and she makes $45k. He's telling her she should cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk because of their income difference.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is splitting costs based on income. Typically, when roommates split expenses, it's often by a 50/50 split regardless of income, but in a romantic relationship, expectations can vary. The guy is asking for an equal split, but his girlfriend is arguing that since he earns more, he should contribute more. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In a romantic relationship, some people expect to share expenses equally, while others think it should be based on income. The guy's income is almost double hers. If they split everything 50/50, she might end up paying a larger percentage of her income for the same amount he pays. That could be unfair to her because she's contributing a bigger chunk of her earnings. \n\nThe guy's perspective is that since he's the one who's already renting the place, maybe he's the one who has the existing lease, so he's offering her to split the costs. But if they're moving in together, it's more of a shared living situation, so maybe the split should reflect their income. \n\nAlso, the fact that her friends and others think he's being unfair suggests that there's a societal expectation that in a relationship, especially when one person earns significantly more, the higher earner should contribute more. The guy's stance might be seen as not considering her financial situation relative to hers. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that splitting equally is fair because they're in a relationship and should support each other equally. But given the income disparity, expecting her to pay half could be burdensome. The key here is whether the 50/50 split is fair considering their different earnings. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for insisting on 50/50. If the norm in their social circle is that you adjust the split based on income, then the author is wrong. If the norm is 50/50 regardless, then maybe not. But given that the girlfriend and her friends think he's in the wrong, it's likely that the author is not considering the income difference, which is a valid point. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he's not accounting for their different financial situations.\n"
