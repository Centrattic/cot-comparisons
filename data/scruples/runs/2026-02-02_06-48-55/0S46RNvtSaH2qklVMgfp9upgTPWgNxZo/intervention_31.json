I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The situation is that the guy makes $80k a year, and the girl makes $45k. He wants her to cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. She and her friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nHmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that splitting costs equally might not take into account their different incomes. If he's earning almost double her salary, making her pay half might be unfair because she's contributing a larger portion of her income to the shared expenses. Let me check the numbers. Let's say the total rent is, for example, $2000. If he's making $80k, his monthly income is around $6,666. So $1000 for rent would be about 15% of his income. For her, $45k a year is $3,750 a month. If she has to pay $1000, that's 26.6% of her income, which is a much bigger chunk. That could be a financial strain on her. \n\nAlso, the question is about fairness. Fairness isn't just about splitting costs equally, but about considering each person's ability to pay. Maybe he's not in the wrong if he thinks splitting equally is fair, but maybe he is because he's not considering their income disparity. The fact that his girlfriend and her friends think he's being a jerk suggests that others might see it as unfair. \n\nBut then again, when two people live together, it's common to split expenses 50/50 regardless of income. Some couples might do that as a way to keep things simple and equal. However, in a long-term relationship, especially where there's a significant income difference, maybe it's better to adjust contributions based on income. But since they've only been together 1.5 years, maybe they haven't discussed this yet. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, splitting 50/50 is standard. But in others, the higher earner might contribute more. However, the user is asking from a general perspective, not specific to a culture. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author is stating his expectation upfront, which is good. He's not hiding his stance. The problem is whether his stance is fair. If the girlfriend feels it's unfair because she's contributing a larger percentage of her income, then the author isn't considering her perspective. That would make him at fault for not being considerate of her financial situation. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is okay with splitting 50/50 and the girlfriend isn't, maybe the author isn't wrong, but the issue is a difference in expectations. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether splitting 50/50 without considering income is inherently unfair. \n\nGiven the significant income difference, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not accounting for their different financial situations. The right approach might be to split based on income, so the higher earner pays a larger share. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
