I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. They've been together for 1.5 years. He rents a place by himself since he moved downtown for a job, and now she wants to move in. He's proposing splitting rent, utilities, and groceries equally. She and her friends think he's being unreasonable because his income is higher\u2014$80k vs her $45k.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of splitting costs 50/50 regardless of income. The common advice I've heard is that splitting 50/50 might not be fair if one partner earns significantly more. So if he makes $80k and she makes $45k, his income is almost double. If they split everything equally, he's contributing more in terms of proportion of his income. That could be seen as unfair to her, since she's paying a larger percentage of her earnings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is in a new job and the higher rent is necessary for his job location. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's friends also think he's being a \"douche,\" which might indicate that their cultural or social norms consider splitting based on income as more appropriate.\n\nBut there's another angle: if they are in a committed relationship and moving in together, it's common to share expenses equally as a sign of partnership. However, when incomes differ, splitting by income (e.g., 60/40) might be more equitable. The author's stance is 50/50, which could be seen as not considering the income disparity. \n\nSo, if the author is not adjusting the split based on their incomes, he might be considered unfair. The key point is that in relationships, splitting costs equally isn't always fair when incomes are unequal. Therefore, the author's refusal to adjust the split despite the income difference could make him the asshole. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
