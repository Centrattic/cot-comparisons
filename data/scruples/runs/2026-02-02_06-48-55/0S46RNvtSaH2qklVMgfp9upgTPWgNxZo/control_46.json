She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to split living costs 50/50 with his girlfriend is wrong. The guy is a 22-year-old who rents a place by himself after graduating and moving downtown for a job. His girlfriend wants to move in with him. He says she should cover half the rent, utilities, and groceries. The girlfriend argues that he makes $80k and she makes $45k, so wanting her to pay half is a \"huge dick move.\" Her friends also think he's a douche. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's typical in such situations. In many relationships, splitting costs 50/50 is common, especially if both are contributing equally. However, income disparity can complicate things. If one partner earns significantly more, some might expect the higher earner to contribute a larger share. The guy's income is more than double hers. So if they split everything equally, she's technically contributing more than her income share. But the guy might feel that since he's already covering the rent alone before, adding her to half makes sense. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about the fairness based on income. If they split the rent and utilities 50/50, she's paying a larger percentage of her income compared to his. For example, if rent is $2000, she would pay $1000, which is 22% of her $45k income, while he pays $1000 which is 12.5% of his 80k. That might be seen as unfair to her. So maybe expecting her to pay half isn't fair if their incomes are different. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the guy is not considering that she is contributing to shared expenses like groceries, which might be a smaller portion. But the main issue is rent and utilities. If the rent is high because of his job location, maybe that's his responsibility. But if they're moving in together, the new place might be more centrally located, which benefits both. \n\nAlso, cultural norms vary. Some people split everything 50/50 regardless of income, others adjust based on income. The girlfriend and her friends think he's being unreasonable, so maybe in their social circle, splitting based on income is the norm. The guy might not be wrong in wanting to split equally, but it's a communication issue. They need to discuss and find a fair arrangement that works for both. \n\nSo is the guy in the wrong? If the girlfriend is expecting him to cover more because of the income difference, then wanting 50/50 could be seen as unfair. However, if they agreed beforehand that splitting costs equally is the way they handle finances, then it's not wrong. The answer might depend on their prior agreements and communication. Since the question is about whether he is in the wrong, and given that the girlfriend and her friends think so, the answer might lean towards A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if splitting 50/50 is their agreed method, then he's not wrong. Without prior agreement, expecting her to pay half despite income difference could be seen as not fair. So maybe A is correct.\n"
