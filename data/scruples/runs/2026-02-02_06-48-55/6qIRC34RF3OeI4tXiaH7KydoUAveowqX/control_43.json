We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years. The girlfriend is insecure about her flat chest and brought it up after trying on lingerie. The author told her honestly that he prefers a bigger chest and that he's not as attracted to her size. She was hurt and felt lied to because he hadn't mentioned it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but timing and delivery matter. The author didn't bring up this preference before, even though they've been together for a long time. When the girlfriend raised the issue, he responded with his truth, but maybe without considering how it would affect her. \n\nThe girlfriend was already insecure and trying to fit into certain lingerie. The author's response might have validated her insecurities instead of reassuring her. Even if he's honest, the way he delivered the information could be hurtful. He also mentioned that he prefers her to face away during intercourse, which might imply he's avoiding her chest, but he didn't explain it in a supportive way.\n\nOn the other hand, he was honest about his preferences. But in a long-term relationship, if there are things that affect the other person's self-esteem, it's important to address them with care. Maybe he should have approached it more sensitively, acknowledging her feelings and reassuring her that his attraction isn't solely based on her chest size. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't communicate this before, even though it's a significant aspect of attraction for him. He brought it up when she was already feeling insecure, which might have been a vulnerable moment for her. His honesty is valid, but the timing and delivery could have been better. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often argue about whether honesty is an excuse for hurtful communication. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt lied to, even if he was being honest. So the author might be at fault for not handling the conversation more thoughtfully. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider how his honesty would impact her feelings and didn't approach the conversation with sufficient empathy and reassurance.\n"
