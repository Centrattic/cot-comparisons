We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a three-year relationship where the guy isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. He's honest with her, but it causes her emotional pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've been together for three years, so they're in a long-term committed relationship. The woman brings up her insecurities about her chest size during a casual moment while watching Netflix. She's been trying on lingerie that doesn't fit well, which is making her feel insecure. She asks if he's okay with her chest size. He responds honestly that he prefers bigger chests, which is not a turn-off but not a turn-on either. He also mentions he prefers her facing away during intercourse for this reason.\n\nNow, the key points here are honesty versus hurting feelings. The guy is being truthful, but his honesty is causing his partner emotional distress. In relationships, especially long-term ones, communication is crucial. However, the timing and manner in which he communicates such feedback might be problematic. She didn't ask for a preference; she was expressing her own insecurities and seeking reassurance. His directness without considering her feelings could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAnother factor is the impact of his words. She felt hurt and decided to go home, then texted him later saying he lied about their history of not discussing this. His response was that he didn't know how to respond, but he was being honest. However, honesty alone isn't enough if it's delivered without empathy. In relationships, partners often avoid certain topics to protect each other's feelings. If one partner has never expressed discomfort with the other's body in three years, bringing up that preference suddenly can feel like a betrayal or lack of support.\n\nAlso, the guy's admission that he prefers facing away during intercourse because of her chest size shows that his attraction issues are affecting their physical intimacy. This could lead to deeper issues in the relationship, like feeling unattractive or undesirable. The woman's reaction is valid because she's processing her insecurities and the feedback in a vulnerable moment.\n\nBut then again, the guy is being honest, which is important for a relationship to thrive. However, the way he chose to communicate this might not have been the best approach. He could have acknowledged her insecurities first before expressing his preferences. Maybe a more supportive way to discuss it, focusing on how he appreciates her overall, while being honest about his preferences in a way that doesn't dismiss her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while honesty is important, the way it's delivered matters. The guy's honesty was direct but potentially hurtful because it didn't take into account her emotional state and the context in which she asked the question. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough in his response.\n"
