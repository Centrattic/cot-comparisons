We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. They're talking about not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They mentioned that she brought up the topic, and he was honest about preferring bigger chests. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he never brought it up before.\n\nSo, first, communication in relationships is key. The author says he's honest, but maybe the way he communicated it was abrupt. She was already insecure, and bringing it up in the middle of a movie might have been a bad time. Also, he didn't mention his preferences before, even though they've been dating three years. That could make her feel like he's only now bringing it up because of her insecurity, which might seem like he's not supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't lie. He was truthful, but maybe he didn't consider how his words would affect her. Relationships require both honesty and sensitivity. If he never discussed his preferences before, especially when she was already self-conscious, it's possible that his honesty came off as a betrayal of trust or lack of support. Also, the fact that he prefers facing away during intercourse might have been another sign she picked up on, but he didn't address it earlier.\n\nThe key here is whether the timing and delivery of his honesty were considerate. He might not be in the wrong for being honest, but he could have handled it better. However, if he never communicated his feelings before and this caused her pain, then maybe he is at fault for not addressing it earlier when she was already insecure. The fact that she felt lied to because he didn't mention it before suggests that he might have been dishonest by omission, even if he was truthful when she asked.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings in a more supportive way and waited until she was already upset to bring it up. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
