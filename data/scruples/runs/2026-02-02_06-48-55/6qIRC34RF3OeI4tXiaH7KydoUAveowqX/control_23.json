We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend feeling hurt because he admitted he's not attracted to her chest size. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is honest about his preferences, but he didn't bring it up before. His girlfriend felt like he was being dishonest or hiding his feelings. The key points here are communication and the impact of his honesty.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial, especially regarding things that affect both partners. The author waited until his girlfriend was already insecure about her body to mention a preference that's important to him. That's a problem because he didn't address it earlier when she was already struggling with self-esteem. \n\nAlso, the way he delivered the information might have been harsh. Instead of offering reassurance or support, he focused on his own preferences. His girlfriend probably expected more encouragement, given her insecurities. His honesty, while truthful, might have been delivered without considering her feelings, leading to hurt.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The author isn't necessarily a bad person, but he failed to communicate his feelings in a supportive way and didn't address her insecurities proactively. By holding back and then bringing it up in a moment when she's vulnerable, he's contributing to her hurt. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because his approach was insensitive and he didn't handle the situation with the care it needed.\n"
