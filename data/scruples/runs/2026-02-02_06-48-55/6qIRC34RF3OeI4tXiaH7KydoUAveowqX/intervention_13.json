We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's not attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size, and he told her that. She felt hurt and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. He mentioned they've been dating for three years. He's the first thin person he's been with, so maybe he didn't realize the impact of his words. He said he told her he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger. She got upset, felt lied to because he hadn't brought it up before.\n\nBut wait, he didn't lie. He was honest, but maybe the timing or way he communicated it was an issue. When she asked if he was okay with her chest, he answered truthfully but didn't consider how it might affect her. She was trying on lingerie and already insecure, so the comment probably hurt her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that he usually prefers her facing away during intercourse might have made her feel like he's avoiding intimacy. But he didn't hide it until now; he just didn't bring it up earlier. However, bringing it up after three years might feel like a betrayal. \n\nOn the other hand, honesty is important too. If he's not being his true self, that can be problematic. But maybe he could have approached the conversation differently, showing more empathy and reassurance. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have validated her feelings first.\n\nSo, is he at fault? It seems like he was honest, which is good, but the way he communicated it and the impact on her self-esteem is a problem. He should have been more considerate and perhaps discussed his preferences earlier to avoid hurting her. Therefore, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the timing wasn't appropriate.\n"
