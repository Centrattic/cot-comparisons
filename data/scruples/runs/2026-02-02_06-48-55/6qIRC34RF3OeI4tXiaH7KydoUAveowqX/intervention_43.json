We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest, after being with bigger-chested partners before. \n\nFirst, the key points here are honesty versus hurting feelings. The author admitted they're not attracted to her chest size, which is a personal preference. But they didn't communicate this before, and when they did, it hurt her. The girlfriend felt like the author lied because this was the first time it came up after three years.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is crucial. The author might think they're being honest, but if they never discussed this before, bringing it up suddenly can feel like a betrayal. The girlfriend's insecurity about her body is also a factor here. She tried on lingerie and was already feeling insecure, so the comment likely exacerbated her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, authenticity is important. People have different preferences, and the author isn't wrong for having them. But the way it was delivered might be the issue. The timing and context\u2014during a moment where the girlfriend was already insecure\u2014could have been handled more sensitively. Also, the fact that the author never mentioned this before three years in suggests they might have been avoiding the conversation, which could lead to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they were honest, which is good, but maybe they could have approached the conversation better. However, the core issue is about differing attractions. The author isn't wrong for having preferences, but the impact of their honesty was hurtful. In terms of the AITA framework, the question is whether the action (being honest about preferences) is the asshole move.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, being honest isn't the issue, but causing harm unintentionally might still make you the asshole if you didn't consider the other person's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt lied to and hurt. The author didn't address her insecurities proactively, and bringing it up in that context was careless.\n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong for having preferences, they are in the wrong for how they communicated it without considering their partner's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
