We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not being physically attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size, and how that affected their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for three years. The girlfriend is insecure about her body, especially her flat chest, which is a new experience for the author since his previous partners were bigger. The key point is that the author admitted he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. The girlfriend felt hurt because this was the first time he mentioned it, and she felt like he lied by not bringing it up before.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues that he was being honest, which is valid. However, communication in relationships is crucial. Even if he's honest, the timing and approach matter. The girlfriend had been struggling with insecurity and tried on lingerie, which she was told didn't fit. Then the author brings up his preference, which might have been unexpected and hurtful.\n\nThe author didn't address her insecurities earlier. Instead of reinforcing her self-esteem, he highlighted a physical trait she's insecure about. Even if it's the truth, it's possible he didn't communicate it in a way that considered her feelings. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention his preferences before, which suggests that there might be a lack of communication about physical preferences in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings, which is also important. Relationships require honesty, but they also need to balance honesty with kindness and consideration. The author could have approached the situation differently, perhaps by reassuring her while being honest. However, the fact that he's been with her for three years and never mentioned this before the issue came up might indicate that he didn't consider how his silence could be affecting her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author's honesty led to hurting his girlfriend's feelings, especially on a topic she's already insecure about, it might be seen as the wrong approach. The author could have handled it more sensitively. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his honesty was delivered without considering her feelings, leading to emotional harm.\n"
