We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The girlfriend brought up the topic after he didn't comment on her chest, and he admitted he prefers bigger breasts. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he didn't mention this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. It's important to discuss preferences and boundaries, but timing and delivery matter. He waited three years to mention this preference. Maybe he thought it wasn't important or didn't want to hurt her. But by not bringing it up, he might have contributed to her insecurity. She tried on lingerie that didn't fit, which made her feel unattractive, so she was seeking reassurance. His response could have been more supportive. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have acknowledged her feelings and reassured her that her worth isn't tied to her body. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers facing away during intercourse might make her feel like he's avoiding intimacy. His honesty is important, but maybe he didn't express it in a way that was validating. He says he didn't know what to tell her, but in a long-term relationship, partners should anticipate each other's insecurities and communicate openly. \n\nOn the other hand, he was honest, and it's his right to have preferences. But maybe he should have addressed her insecurities earlier or in a more compassionate way. The fact that she felt lied about suggests that his previous reassurances (if any) were lacking. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the key points are his failure to communicate this preference earlier and his response not addressing her emotional needs. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the communication well, contributing to her hurt feelings. However, there's nuance because he was honest, but the timing and delivery were poor. The main issue is that he didn't consider her feelings when bringing up this preference after she was already vulnerable.\n"
