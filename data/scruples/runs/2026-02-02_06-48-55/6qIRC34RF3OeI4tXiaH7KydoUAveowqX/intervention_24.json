We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is in a 3-year relationship with their girlfriend, who is petite and flat-chested. The author has a preference for bigger chests, which they've never really mentioned before. The girlfriend brought up the issue after trying on lingerie that didn't fit, and the author admitted they aren't attracted to her chest size. The girlfriend felt hurt, thinking they lied because they didn't mention it before.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author didn't bring up their preference earlier, which might have led to the girlfriend feeling blindsided. Even if it's the truth, withholding such information could be seen as not being open. The girlfriend's insecurity about her body is important here; maybe she felt that the author's lack of mention implied approval or acceptance, which it didn't. The author's honesty could be seen as necessary, but the timing and the fact that it came up after the girlfriend already had insecurities might be an issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned preferring bigger sizes and that's why they face away during sex. The girlfriend might feel that her body isn't accepted as it is, which can affect her self-esteem. The fact that they've been together three years and this is the first time bringing it up might suggest the author didn't consider her feelings enough. They might have prioritized their own honesty over her emotional well-being in the moment. While being honest is important, how and when it's communicated matters. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the truth was delivered in a way that hurt her, which could make the author responsible for not handling it more sensitively.\n\nSo, even if the author is honest, the way they handled the situation could be flawed. They might have been in the wrong because they didn't address the issue sooner, leading her to feel unaccepted. The key points are communication timing, sensitivity to her insecurities, and the impact of their honesty on her feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
