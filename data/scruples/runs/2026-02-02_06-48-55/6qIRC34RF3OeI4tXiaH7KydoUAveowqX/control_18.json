We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He's always preferred bigger chests, and when she asked if he's okay with her flat chest, he told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones. She got hurt and feels like he lied because he didn't bring it up before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The guy says he's being honest, which is important. But the question is whether honesty here crosses into being hurtful. The girlfriend was insecure about her body and tried on lingerie that didn't fit, leading her to ask. The guy's response was direct, but maybe he could have been more empathetic. \n\nThe key points are: he didn't bring it up before, which might have made her feel like he wasn't being honest. Also, the way he delivered the truth might not have considered her feelings. Even though he's honest, communication style matters. Relationships require both honesty and kindness. If he hadn't mentioned his preference before, it's possible he contributed to her insecurity by not affirming her body. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not the asshole for being honest, but maybe he could have handled it better. The girl has a right to feel hurt, but the guy's intention was to be truthful. However, the timing and context might be an issue. He should have addressed it in a way that made her feel secure instead of causing her pain. So, while he's not entirely wrong, there's a part where he could have been more sensitive. The answer might be A because even though he's honest, the way he communicated it without prior discussion or empathy might make him the asshole. But I'm a bit torn because being honest isn't inherently wrong. However, in relationships, how you communicate is as important as the content. So the answer is A.\n"
