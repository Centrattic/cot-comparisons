We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about attraction to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has been in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. He mentions that she's the first thin person he's been with, and she's petite. He's used to being with women who have bigger chests. The issue arose when she asked if he was okay with her flat chest. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones and that it's not a turn-on for him. She felt hurt and left, saying he lied by omission.\n\nSo, the key points here are honesty in a relationship versus the impact of that honesty. The author is being honest about his preferences, which he didn't mention before. The girlfriend felt that not bringing it up over three years was a lie, while he argues that he was just being honest when asked.\n\nHonesty in relationships is important, but so is the timing and how it's communicated. The author waited until she brought up the topic and then gave his honest opinion. However, he might have considered her insecurities beforehand. Maybe if he had addressed it earlier in a supportive way, it would have been better. But since she asked directly, his response was truthful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also valid because not bringing it up for three years could be seen as neglecting her feelings. The author's preference is his own, but not discussing it when she's already insecure about her body might have been hurtful. The fact that he prefers her to face away during sex related to her chest size might have been something she didn't know, leading to her feeling he was being dishonest.\n\nIn terms of whether he's the asshole, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's being honest. On the other, he didn't consider the emotional impact of his honesty. Relationships often require balancing honesty with empathy. If he had communicated this in a way that reassured her and validated her feelings earlier, it might have been better. But since she asked, his answer was truthful, but maybe the way he delivered it or the fact that it took three years to express could be seen as a failure to address her insecurities proactively.\n\nI think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because even though honesty is important, the timing and the way he expressed it without considering her feelings over the duration of the relationship plays a role. He didn't just say it in a supportive manner; he admitted it was about his preference, which could make her feel inadequate. The fact that she felt lied to because he never mentioned it before suggests that he should have been more attentive to her insecurities and communicated his feelings in a way that supported her, not just stated his preferences.\n"
