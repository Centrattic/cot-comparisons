We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for admitting he isn't attracted to his girlfriend's chest size. The situation is that they've been dating for almost three years, and the girlfriend has always been insecure about her flat chest. He never mentioned it before, but when she brought it up, he admitted he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt and like he lied.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author says they care about each other and have fun together. The key issue here is communication. The author didn't bring up this preference before, even though his girlfriend had insecurities. By not addressing it earlier, maybe he contributed to her feeling unvalued or not considered. When she finally asked, his response was honest but potentially hurtful because it didn't validate her feelings enough. \n\nThe girlfriend tried on lingerie that didn't fit, leading to her insecurity. By not supporting her or reinforcing her worth beyond her physical attributes, he might have made her feel like her body isn't attractive enough. Even though he's being honest, the timing and delivery could be problematic. In a long-term relationship, partners often learn to appreciate each other beyond initial preferences. If he's not attracted to her in that way, but still chooses to be with her, maybe he should have found a way to express that in a more supportive manner. \n\nBut then again, honesty in relationships is important. If he's not being truthful about his preferences, that could lead to more issues. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. The fact that he didn't address her insecurities when they came up earlier could be a point against him. Also, the fact that she felt lied about because he didn't mention it before suggests that his honesty now was delayed. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, he didn't handle it well. He could have acknowledged her feelings more, maybe reassured her that her worth isn't tied to her chest size, while still being honest about his preferences. Instead, he focused on his preference without considering how it would affect her. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance honesty with kindness. The author's honesty is valid, but the impact on his partner wasn't considered. Therefore, he's not entirely without fault. But he's also being truthful, which is a positive. However, the harm caused suggests he's at least partially in the wrong. The main issue is that he didn't communicate his feelings earlier when she had insecurities, leading to her hurt feelings when he finally did mention it. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't manage the communication effectively, causing hurt and making her feel unappreciated. Even if his preferences are genuine, the way he expressed them and the lack of prior communication are problematic.\n"
