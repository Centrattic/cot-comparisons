We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the couple has been together for three years. The girlfriend is thin and has been insecure about her flat chest. She asked him if he was okay with it after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests and that it's why he prefers her facing away during sex. She felt hurt and thought he lied because he didn't mention it before.\n\nSo, the main points here are honesty in a relationship versus the impact of that honesty on the partner's feelings. The author is being honest about his preferences, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the timing and the way he communicated it might be problematic. The girlfriend was already insecure and had been trying to fit into something that didn't work, which led her to ask the question. The author's response, while honest, might have been hurtful because it confirmed her insecurities. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it's also important to consider how the information is delivered and its potential impact. The author didn't lie; he was truthful, but maybe he didn't validate her feelings enough. He could have acknowledged her insecurities more compassionately before stating his preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that he made an anonymous account and asked for advice suggests he's aware of possible backlash and might not have considered her feelings fully. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling unattractive can affect self-esteem, especially if it's a long-standing insecurity. The author's honesty might be justified, but the way he handled the situation could be seen as insensitive, leading to him being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his honest communication was delivered in a way that hurt his partner's feelings, even if he was truthful. The balance between honesty and empathy is crucial here.\n"
