We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been dating for 3 years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is different from previous partners the author was with. She asked if he's okay with her chest size because she's insecure. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger and it's not a turn on for him. She felt hurt and thought he lied because he never mentioned it before. \n\nSo the main issue here is communication. The author is being honest but maybe didn't consider the emotional impact. He said he didn't know how to respond, but in a long-term relationship, partners usually communicate their preferences. However, bringing up a preference that's been unspoken after three years might be hurtful, especially if it's something she's insecure about. \n\nBut is he wrong? Well, he's being honest about his preferences, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the way he communicated it might have been abrupt. Did he consider her feelings beforehand? Maybe he could have approached it more gently, acknowledging her insecurities and reassuring her about other aspects of her body. \n\nAlso, the fact that he faces away during intercourse because of her chest size suggests there's a pattern of behavior that wasn't addressed earlier. If he's been avoiding physical intimacy in a certain way due to this, she might have noticed something but didn't know why. Bringing it up suddenly without prior discussion could feel like a betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not obligated to pretend to be attracted to something he isn't. But in a relationship, there's a balance between honesty and kindness. Maybe he should have had the conversation earlier or framed it differently. \n\nThe girlfriend feeling like he lied is valid because he didn't bring up his preference before, even if he was being honest. She might have thought he was okay with her body as it is. So the problem here is the timing and delivery of the honesty. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. Being honest isn't wrong, but the impact on the partner matters. The author didn't consider her feelings and the history of their relationship when he decided to be honest. So while he's not a complete asshole, he's probably in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively. The answer would likely be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
