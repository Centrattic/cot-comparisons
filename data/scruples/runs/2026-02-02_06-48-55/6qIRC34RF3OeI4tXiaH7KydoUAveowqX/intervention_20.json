We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author is not physically attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The girlfriend asks him about his feelings regarding her chest size after trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. He tells her honestly that he prefers bigger chests, which upsets her. She feels lied to because he didn't bring it up before, and the author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but timing and approach matter. The author waited three years to mention this preference. That could be seen as not addressing her insecurities or not being considerate of her feelings. On the other hand, he didn't lie; he was honest about his preferences. But maybe he should have addressed it earlier if it was a concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Feeling insecure and then hearing that your partner isn't attracted to a part of your body you're insecure about can be hurtful. The author's honesty might be justified, but the way he delivered it and the timing could be problematic. He didn't mention this before, so she might feel like he wasn't considering her feelings or addressing it constructively.\n\nAlso, the fact that he avoids facing her during intercourse might indicate he's been aware of this preference for a while but didn't communicate it. That could be seen as passive-aggressive or not taking her feelings into account. Relationships require both partners to feel valued and respected. If his preference is affecting how he interacts physically, he should have discussed it earlier to find a solution that makes both comfortable.\n\nBut then again, he didn't lie. He's not obligated to have feelings he doesn't. However, in a healthy relationship, partners should communicate their needs and concerns before issues escalate. The key here is whether he was aware of her insecurities and chose not to address them, leading to her feeling hurt.\n\nAnother angle is that attraction is subjective. He's being honest about his preferences, which is valid, but he needs to balance it with empathy. Just stating a preference without acknowledging the emotional impact on his partner could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating earlier and for not handling the situation with more sensitivity. Even if he didn't lie, the way he approached the conversation and the timing could have been better. He should have addressed it before it led to hurt feelings, maybe in a more supportive way rather than just stating his preference.\n"
