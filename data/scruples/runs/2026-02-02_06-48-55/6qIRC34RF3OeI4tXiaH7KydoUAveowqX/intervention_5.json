We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body type, specifically her chest size. She's petite and flat-chested, while he's used to being with bigger girls. She brought up the topic after trying on lingerie that didn't fit well, and he admitted that he prefers bigger chests. She got hurt and left, feeling like he misled her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is being honest about his preferences. He didn't lie; he just hadn't discussed this with her before. But the girlfriend felt hurt because it was a surprise after three years. The issue here is communication. In a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable discussing their preferences and boundaries. However, bringing up such a sensitive topic after three years might be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the girlfriend had been insecure about her body and the author never addressed it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest. He didn't hide his preferences, and he didn't have a history of lying. He explained that he's just not attracted to her chest size, which is a personal preference. But the way he chose to express this might have been hurtful. Maybe he could have been more considerate in how he communicated his feelings, especially considering her insecurities. Relationships require both honesty and empathy. While honesty is important, it's also crucial to consider how your words might affect your partner, especially on topics they're sensitive about.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend might have expected her partner to appreciate her body as it is, given the long-term nature of the relationship. The fact that he only mentioned this after three years could make her feel like he wasn't being genuine before. However, if he was truly not attracted to her, maybe that's a deal-breaker for him, but it's not necessarily his fault if his preferences are valid. The problem is more about how the communication was handled rather than the honesty itself.\n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of communication. The author didn't address his partner's insecurities when they arose, leading to a situation where she felt blindsided. While his honesty is important, he could have handled it more sensitively. So, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier and didn't consider how this revelation would impact her. The answer would be A (in the wrong) because he should have addressed these issues sooner and with more care.\n"
