We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The situation is that the author admitted to preferring bigger chests, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, and the girlfriend was insecure about her chest size. The author didn't mention this preference before, which might have contributed to the hurt feelings. Honesty is important in relationships, but timing and delivery also matter. The girlfriend tried to open up about her insecurities, and the author's response might have been a surprise to her because he hadn't brought up his preferences before.\n\nNext, communication is key here. If the author had expressed his preferences earlier, they could have worked through it together. By bringing it up after three years, without prior discussion, it might have felt like a betrayal. The girlfriend felt lied to, which suggests a breakdown in communication. The author's honesty, while genuine, might have been delivered in a way that wasn't considerate of her feelings at that moment.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's previous partners had different body types shows that preferences can change or be influenced by circumstances. The girlfriend's insecurity was something she had tried to address, and the author's comment could have invalidated her efforts. The author's preference isn't inherently wrong, but the way he communicated it and the lack of prior discussion might be the issue.\n\nIn terms of emotional impact, the girlfriend felt hurt and unattractive, which is significant. Relationships require mutual respect and support. Even if the author's preference is natural, how he expressed it and the lack of empathy for her feelings could make him the asshole here. The key points are the timing, the lack of prior communication, and the emotional harm caused.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because he failed to communicate his preferences earlier and his response was hurtful to his partner's feelings without considering the context of her insecurities.\n"
