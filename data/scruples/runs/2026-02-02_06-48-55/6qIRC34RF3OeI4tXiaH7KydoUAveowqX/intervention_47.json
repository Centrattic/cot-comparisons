We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating almost three years, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The main issue came up when she asked if he was okay with her flat chest, leading to a conversation where he admitted he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They care about each other and have been together a long time. The man's honesty here is a key point. He says he's being truthful about his preferences, which isn't a lie. However, the way he delivered it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't bring it up before, which suggests that maybe he should have communicated his preferences earlier in the relationship, especially since she was already insecure about this.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if he's being honest, bringing up a preference that affects the other person's self-esteem without prior discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she was already insecure about her body means that this conversation could be particularly triggering. The man's response to her insecurity wasn't supportive; instead, he validated her insecurity by stating a preference that likely hurt her feelings.\n\nAlso, the context matters. He mentioned that he's been with bigger women before and prefers bigger chests. The girlfriend being the first thin one might mean that his preferences are more about his own attraction rather than a general issue. But bringing it up in a situation where she's already feeling insecure and then causing her emotional pain could be seen as the wrong approach, even if his intentions were honest.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of his words. Even if he's truthful, the way he chose to express it without considering her feelings might be the problem. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't address this before, which implies that he might have been aware of her insecurities but didn't address them in a supportive way. His honesty was delivered in a way that caused her emotional harm, which can make him the asshole in the situation despite his honesty.\n\nIn summary, while honesty is important, the lack of prior communication and the hurtful impact of his words suggest that he might be in the wrong. The key is balancing honesty with empathy and considering the other person's feelings, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like body image.\n"
