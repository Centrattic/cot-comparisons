We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been together for three years, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The key issue here is that the girlfriend brought up her insecurity about her flat chest, and the author admitted they prefer bigger chests. This led to her feeling hurt and the conversation straining their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend has been insecure about her body for some time, and the author didn't address this before. Now, when she finally asks about it, the author's honest answer (which is that they don't find her chest size attractive) might have been a blow to her self-esteem. The problem here is that the author didn't acknowledge her feelings or reassure her, even though they prefer bigger curves. They just stated their preference, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author claims they didn't know how to respond and were being honest. But in a relationship, honesty is important, yet it's equally crucial to communicate in a way that's respectful and considers the other person's feelings. The author's response didn't seem to validate the girlfriend's feelings or show empathy. Instead, they focused on their own preferences without considering the emotional impact.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend felt lied to because the author never mentioned this before. That suggests a lack of open communication about preferences over the three-year relationship. Maybe the author should have discussed this earlier to manage expectations and support their partner's insecurities. By bringing it up now, especially in a way that highlights her insecurity, the author might have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid. Feeling unattractive because of a specific body feature can lead to low self-esteem. The author's admission, while honest, didn't provide reassurance about other aspects of her attractiveness or their feelings for her. It's possible that the author's focus on one physical trait overshadowed their appreciation for her other qualities, which could be damaging to her self-worth.\n\nHowever, the author isn't entirely wrong either. They are allowed to have preferences, and it's not wrong to be honest. The issue is how they communicated that honesty. The way the information was delivered and the lack of emotional support might have been the main problem. The author could have acknowledged her feelings first before stating their preference, perhaps offering reassurance that despite the preference, they still find her attractive in other ways.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's honesty might not be the issue, but the manner in which they delivered it without considering the emotional impact on their partner could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not handling the conversation with more empathy and support.\n"
