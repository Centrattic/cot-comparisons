We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThey've been with their girlfriend for almost three years. She's the first thin person they've been with. She's petite and flat-chested, whereas previous partners were bigger, especially in the chest area. The girlfriend asked if the author was okay with her chest size because she was insecure and trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The author admitted they prefer bigger chests, aren't attracted to her size, and that's why they face away during sex. The girlfriend felt hurt, thought the author lied, and went home. The author is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and honesty in a relationship. The author was honest about their preferences, but the girlfriend felt it was a betrayal or a lie because the author didn't bring it up before. The author didn't realize that their preference might affect the girlfriend's feelings, especially since she's been insecure about her body. \n\nIs honesty an excuse for not considering the partner's feelings? Even if the author is honest, how they communicate it matters. The girlfriend's insecurity was there before, so the author should have addressed it earlier. By not discussing it, the author might have ignored her feelings and only chose to bring it up when she was already vulnerable (trying on lingerie and feeling insecure). \n\nAlso, the fact that the author prefers bigger chests but is with someone who doesn't fit that might indicate a deeper issue. Maybe the author is using their preference as an excuse to avoid intimacy issues or other problems. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong for being honest in this specific context. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had discussed this earlier, they could have both addressed the issue. Bringing it up suddenly when the girlfriend is already feeling insecure could be seen as insensitive. The author's honesty is important, but timing and delivery matter. The girlfriend felt lied to because the author didn't mention it before, even if they are being honest now. That could be a breach of trust. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their preference earlier and brought it up in a way that hurt their partner. Honesty is good, but it needs to be handled with care and empathy, especially when the partner has known insecurities. The author should have addressed this issue when the relationship started or when they noticed the girlfriend's insecurity, not after the fact. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
