We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the person not being attracted to their girlfriend's chest size, which is different from what they've been used to. The girlfriend got hurt when he told her this, and she feels lied to because he didn't mention it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, and he's been honest about his preferences now. But the key issue is how and when he brought up this information. Was it necessary to bring it up in the moment when she was feeling insecure? Also, did he consider the emotional impact of his honesty?\n\nThe girlfriend was already insecure about her body, especially her chest size. She tried on lingerie and didn't like how it fit, leading to her asking about his feelings. The person answered honestly, but maybe he didn't approach it with enough sensitivity. Honesty is important, but communication in relationships requires empathy. By not addressing her insecurities early on, he might have failed to support her feelings. \n\nAlso, he mentioned preferring bigger chests and that's why he prefers her facing away during intercourse. That could be perceived as not valuing her for who she is, making her feel inadequate. Even if it's true, the way he communicated his preference could be seen as hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention this before. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences earlier, especially since her insecurities were present. Delaying the conversation until she was vulnerable might have contributed to the hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the person is being honest about his preferences, which is important. But honesty alone isn't enough if it's delivered without consideration. The question is whether he handled the situation correctly. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to communicate preferences in a way that doesn't belittle the partner's feelings. The fact that he waited until she was already feeling insecure to bring it up might be the issue. Also, not acknowledging her feelings and just stating his preference could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, while he's being honest, the timing and approach might have been wrong. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care and sensitivity.\n"
