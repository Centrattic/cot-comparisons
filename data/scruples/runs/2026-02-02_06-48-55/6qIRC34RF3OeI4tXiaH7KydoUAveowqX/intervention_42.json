We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The situation is that he's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked him about his attraction to her chest, and he admitted he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt because he didn't mention this before.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider communication in relationships. Both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs and preferences. The author admitted he didn't know how to respond, but he was honest. However, bringing up something like this suddenly after three years might be a problem. Why didn't he communicate this earlier? If he's had preferences all along, especially since he mentioned he's been with bigger women before, maybe he should have discussed it when they started dating instead of waiting until she brought it up after three years.\n\nAlso, the context matters. His girlfriend was already insecure about her body. By bringing up his preference for bigger chests, he might have reinforced her insecurities. Even if he's honest, the timing and the way he delivered it could be hurtful. She felt like he lied because he didn't mention it before. Honesty is important, but it's also about how and when you communicate sensitive topics.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require mutual respect. If one partner has insecurities, the other should be considerate. The author's response didn't seem to address her feelings but focused on his preferences. He could have validated her feelings instead of just stating his own. For example, he could have said he appreciates her in other ways but also has his preferences. But he didn't, which led to her feeling hurt.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the key points are the lack of prior communication, the impact on her feelings, and the manner of delivery. Even though honesty is a virtue, the way it was handled here might be unkind. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
