We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. From the situation described, the girlfriend seems to be insecure about her flat chest. She mentions that she's noticed he hasn't commented on that aspect and that it made her feel unattractive. The author then tells her honestly that he prefers bigger breasts and that this is why he prefers her facing away during intercourse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, so there's been a long time for things like this to come up. The girlfriend's insecurity is something she's been dealing with, and she brought it up because she's been trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The author's response, while honest, might have been hurtful because he didn't address her feelings first. Instead of just stating his preference, maybe he could have reassured her about her attractiveness in other ways before mentioning his own preference.\n\nCommunication in relationships is key. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering her emotional state. Even if the truth is necessary, the way it's delivered matters. The girlfriend felt like he lied because he didn't bring it up before, which might mean he didn't acknowledge her insecurities in the past. The author's honesty is valid, but the timing and method of delivery could be seen as insensitive. \n\nAlso, the fact that he uses her back during intercourse might be a red flag for her, thinking he's not satisfied or not attracted to her. The author's explanation after the fact may not have been comforting enough. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the conversation had a negative impact, and the author might have done something differently to validate her feelings first. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily a bad person for being honest about his preferences, but in how he communicated it. The problem is the lack of consideration for her feelings and the way he handled the situation. The answer would probably be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because the issue lies in the manner of the communication rather than the truth itself. However, some might argue that honesty is important, but in relationships, how you're honest is just as important. So, the author's approach was wrong, making him the asshole here.\n"
