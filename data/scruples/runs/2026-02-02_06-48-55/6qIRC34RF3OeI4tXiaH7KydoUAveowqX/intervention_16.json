We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that the couple has been together for three years, and the girlfriend is thin with a flat chest, which is different from the types of women the author has been with before. The author mentions that he prefers bigger chests and that this isn't a turn-off but not a turn-on. The girlfriend was insecure about her body, which the author brought up honestly, and she felt hurt and that he lied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. In long-term relationships, honesty is important, but so is how that honesty is delivered. The author waited three years to mention his preference, which might have been a key issue. The girlfriend had been trying to fit into lingerie and was already insecure, so bringing up his preference then could have been hurtful. Timing and context matter a lot. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author prefers a different body type might be natural, but the way he communicated it made his partner feel unattractive. Even if he's honest, the impact on her feelings is significant. Relationships require balance between honesty and compassion. \n\nAnother angle: the author's preference might not be a deal-breaker, but the fact that he never mentioned it before and then did so during a vulnerable moment could make it seem like a betrayal. The girlfriend might feel like her insecurities were ignored or dismissed. \n\nHowever, the author could argue that he was being truthful and that his preference isn't a deal-breaker. But in relationships, especially long-term ones, partners often adjust their expectations. The key here is whether the author's honesty was delivered in a way that respected his partner's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the method of communication was considerate. Since the author didn't address this earlier and brought it up when the girlfriend was already insecure, it's likely that he was in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings of being hurt and lied to (even if he was honest) suggest that the way he communicated his preference was inappropriate.\n"
