We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to preferring bigger chests. The issue arose when she asked if he's okay with her flat chest. He admitted he prefers bigger ones, which made her feel hurt and led to her leaving.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend had insecurities about her body, which the author's comment exacerbates. The timing is important too; she was already in a mental funk after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. His honesty might be valid, but the way it was delivered and the context matters. In a relationship, communication is crucial, but it's also about considering the other person's feelings, especially when they have known insecurities.\n\nHe mentions it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on. However, bringing this up after three years might make her feel like he hasn't been truthful or supportive. The fact that he didn't bring it up before could be seen as a lie by omission. Also, the impact on her self-esteem is significant here. While he's being honest, the effect on her is hurt and feeling unattractive. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but it's also about how and when you share such information. Since she had ongoing insecurities, it's possible that he should have approached the topic more carefully, maybe in a way that reassures her rather than pointing out her insecurities. The fact that he uses her facing away during intercourse as an example might also come off as using a workaround instead of addressing her feelings directly.\n\nSo, while he's not being malicious, his approach might be considered insensitive. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his honesty, although truthful, was delivered in a way that hurt her and didn't take into account her existing insecurities. The key is balancing honesty with empathy and timing.\n"
