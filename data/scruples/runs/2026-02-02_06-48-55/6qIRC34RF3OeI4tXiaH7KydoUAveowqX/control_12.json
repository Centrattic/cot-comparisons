We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the man isn't physically attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size, and he's been honest about it. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought he was lying because he hadn't mentioned this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for three years, and the man admits he's never been with someone as thin as her. He's been attracted to bigger chests in the past. The key issue is communication. He was honest when asked, but maybe the timing or the way he delivered the truth was hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend had been insecure about her body and tried on lingerie that didn't fit, leading to her asking the question. The man's response was straightforward but might have been insensitive. Even if he's honest, the way he communicates it can affect his partner's feelings. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is empathy. The man's honesty might not be the problem per se, but not addressing her insecurities earlier. If he always felt this way but never discussed it, even when she was already struggling with self-esteem, then maybe he should have brought it up sooner or in a more supportive manner. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers her facing away during intercourse might have added to her feelings of inadequacy. She could perceive this as him avoiding her body, which might reinforce her insecurities. The man's response might not be malicious, but it's possible he didn't consider how his words would impact her emotionally. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have roles. The girlfriend might need to work on her self-esteem, but the boyfriend could have communicated his feelings in a way that's honest yet supportive. Since he didn't address this before she brought it up, and when she did, his response was blunt without enough reassurance, that might make him at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, while honesty is key, the way he handled the conversation could have been more empathetic. Therefore, he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room to argue he could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the main issue is his honesty versus her hurt feelings, the answer might lean towards him not being the asshole, but there's a nuance here. The key is whether the way he expressed the truth was unnecessarily hurtful. Since he was honest but didn't account for her feelings, maybe he's partially at fault. But in some perspectives, honesty isn't the problem. It's complicated, but I think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong because he was honest, even if the delivery could have been better. However, in terms of relational sensitivity, there's room for improvement, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about optimal communication.\n"
