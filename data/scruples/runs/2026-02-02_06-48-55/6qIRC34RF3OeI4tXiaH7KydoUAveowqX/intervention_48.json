We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that the girlfriend asked him about her flat chest, and he told her he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt and lied to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend had insecurities about her body, especially her chest size. She noticed he didn't comment on it and asked directly. The author's response was honest but maybe not considerate enough. He said he prefers bigger, which might have been a trigger for her insecurities. \n\nThe key points: Communication in relationships is important. The author didn't bring up this preference before, which might have led to her feeling unaware. Also, the way he delivered the honesty might have been harsh. Being honest is good, but timing and sensitivity matter. He could have validated her feelings instead of just stating his preference. \n\nHe mentions that he usually prefers bigger, but it's not a deal-breaker. However, the fact that he didn't address her insecurities and instead confirmed her fears could have been hurtful. The girlfriend felt lied to because expectations weren't met. \n\nIn relationships, partners have different needs. The author might not be wrong for being honest, but the way he handled the situation could have been better. Maybe he should have acknowledged her insecurities first or found a kinder way to express his preferences without making her feel inadequate. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though honesty is important, the delivery and context are crucial. He could have been more empathetic and supportive rather than just stating his preference, which hurt her feelings. The fact that he didn't mention this before and the immediate impact on her self-esteem suggests he could have handled it differently.\n"
