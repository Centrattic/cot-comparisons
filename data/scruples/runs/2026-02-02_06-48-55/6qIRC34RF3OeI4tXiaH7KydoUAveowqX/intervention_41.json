We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being honest with his girlfriend about not finding her chest size attractive, which led to her feeling hurt and leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for three years, and the girlfriend had been insecure about her body, especially her chest size. She brought up the topic because she noticed he didn't comment on it and was trying on lingerie that didn't fit well. The author admitted he prefers bigger chests and that his preference affects his intimacy with her.\n\nNow, the key points here are honesty versus communication and emotional impact. The author was truthful, but did he communicate his feelings in a way that was considerate? The girlfriend felt lied to because he never mentioned this before, which might mean he didn't address her insecurities proactively. Being honest is important, but timing and approach matter in relationships. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's insecurities are valid. If he knew she felt this way, perhaps he should have addressed it earlier rather than waiting for her to bring it up. By not acknowledging her feelings and instead focusing on his preference, he might have come off as dismissive. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel valued. The author's honesty led to hurt, which suggests that while being truthful, he could have framed his response in a way that affirmed her attractiveness beyond just her chest size. The fact that he never mentioned this preference before might indicate a lack of communication, which can be a problem. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction shows that this issue is significant to her. The author's response didn't seem to validate her feelings, which could be seen as insensitive. Even if his feelings are genuine, the way he communicated them might have been harsh. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and communication. While honesty is important, it's also about how it's delivered and whether it addresses the partner's emotional needs.\n"
