We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man not being physically attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and the girlfriend has been insecure about her body. She asked him if he's okay with her flat chest, and he told her honestly that he prefers a bigger size. She felt hurt and said he lied because he never mentioned this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is honest but maybe didn't handle the conversation well. The girlfriend had been dealing with insecurity, and the timing of the truth might have been an issue. Was it wrong to be honest? Or was the way he delivered it the problem?\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is communication. If he never mentioned his preferences before, and now he brings it up in a way that triggers her insecurity, maybe he's not wrong in wanting to be truthful, but perhaps he could have approached it more sensitively. The fact that he didn't know how to respond and just said the truth might not be malicious, but it could have been more compassionate.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling hurt and like he lied is a natural response when a partner shares something that's never been discussed. The author didn't consider that she might be seeking reassurance, not just information. So, while he's not in the wrong for being honest, there's a case for him not handling it well. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author is in the wrong. However, in AITA scenarios, sometimes being honest isn't the issue if done with care. The answer might hinge on whether the author's honesty was delivered without consideration for her feelings. So, maybe the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because he could have been more empathetic.\n"
