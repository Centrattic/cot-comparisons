We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who admitted to his girlfriend that he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. They've been dating for three years.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue seems to be about communication in a relationship. The guy didn't mention his preference for bigger chests before, even though she was insecure about it. He only mentioned it when she brought it up after noticing his lack of comments. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger, which made her feel hurt and like he lied. \n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break down the factors. In relationships, communication is key. If someone has preferences that could affect their partner's feelings, it's important to discuss them, especially when the partner is already insecure. The guy didn't bring this up earlier, even though she had mentioned insecurities. By not addressing it, he might have contributed to her low self-esteem. When she finally asked, he was honest but it came as a surprise, which hurt her.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy is being truthful about his preferences. He didn't hide it when asked. But the timing and lack of prior communication might be the issue here. In a healthy relationship, partners should feel comfortable discussing such things without waiting for the partner to be in a vulnerable position. The guy's honesty is important, but the way and timing of revealing it matters. \n\nAlso, the fact that she felt lied about because he didn't mention it before. If he didn't think to mention it when she was insecure, maybe he should have. The fact that he never addressed her insecurities could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier, especially when aware of her insecurities. Even though he was honest, the lack of proactive communication led to hurt feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
