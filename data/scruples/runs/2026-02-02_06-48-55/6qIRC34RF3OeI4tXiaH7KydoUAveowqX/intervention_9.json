We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about attraction to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nThe girlfriend is petite and has always been insecure about her flat chest. They've been together for three years, and the guy has always preferred bigger chests, mentioning that in the past. The issue came up when the girlfriend asked if he was okay with her chest size. He admitted he prefers bigger, which made her feel hurt and like he lied. The question is whether he's the asshole here (option A) or not (option B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. It's important in any relationship to be honest about preferences, but timing and how it's communicated matter. The guy waited until after three years to mention his preference, which the girlfriend found hurtful. Maybe he should have communicated this earlier if it was a significant issue.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend had asked him directly, so his honesty might be justified. At the same time, the fact that she's been insecure about this for a while and he didn't address it before could contribute to her feeling hurt. Also, the fact that he chooses positions during sex to avoid facing her might indicate he's been avoiding the issue rather than addressing it openly.\n\nOn the other hand, being honest is important. If he's not attracted to her in that way, perhaps he's not the one for her, but given they've been together three years, there's a question of why he didn't raise it earlier. Maybe he's been in denial or didn't want to hurt her feelings. But keeping such a core aspect of attraction a secret for three years could be seen as dishonest, especially if it affects intimacy.\n\nBut the girlfriend's insecurities are also a factor. She might have expected more reassurance. The guy's response might have been direct, but maybe he could have framed it more positively, focusing on other aspects he finds attractive instead of just stating the preference.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did he communicate this in a timely and respectful way? The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention it before. The timing and delivery might be the issue here. If he's been in the relationship for three years and only brings up his preference after she's already had insecurities, that could be seen as contributing to the problem. But is he in the wrong? Or is she also responsible for her own insecurities?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whose actions are more hurtful. The guy's honesty might be the right thing, but the way it was delivered and the fact that he didn't address it earlier could make him the asshole. Alternatively, if he's being honest when asked, maybe not. But since it's a core part of attraction and he's been avoiding it, maybe he's not wrong. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The answer might depend on whether honesty without prior communication is acceptable. In relationships, partners do have different preferences, but if one's a dealbreaker, it should be discussed earlier. Here, he didn't say it's a dealbreaker but rather a preference. However, the fact that it's affecting his intimacy (facing away) suggests it's more than just a preference. So maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing this earlier and for hurting her feelings, even if he's being honest now. So I'd lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
