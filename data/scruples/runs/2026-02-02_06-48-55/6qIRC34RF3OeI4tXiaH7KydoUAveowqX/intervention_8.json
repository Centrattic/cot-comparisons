We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been with her for almost three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The main issue here is communication.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend expressed insecurity about her body, especially her chest size. She noticed he never commented on it and mentioned trying on lingerie that didn't fit well. Then, during a Netflix night, she asked him directly. The author admitted he's not attracted to her chest size, prefers bigger, and that's why he faces away during sex. The girlfriend was hurt and felt lied to because he didn't bring it up before. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, he's being honest, but there's a timing issue. He waited until she brought it up, which might have been because she was already feeling insecure. Maybe he could have approached the topic earlier in a more supportive way. Also, the way he delivered the truth might have come off as blunt, especially if it wasn't framed with empathy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling insecure and then hearing that your partner isn't attracted to a part of your body can be hurtful. The author didn't lie; he was honest, but honesty without consideration for the other person's feelings can be harmful. The key here is that he didn't communicate this preference earlier, which could have led to her feeling like he held back important information. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if something is true, how and when it's shared matters. The author's honesty is commendable, but the timing and the manner might have been careless. He should have considered her feelings and maybe found a way to express it in a way that reassured her attractiveness beyond her chest size. \n\nSo, while he's not malicious, he could have handled it better. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't manage the conversation with sensitivity. But some might say he's not in the wrong for being honest. However, the context of a long-term relationship and the girlfriend's existing insecurities makes his approach problematic.\n"
