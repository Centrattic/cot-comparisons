We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not being attracted to his girlfriend's chest size, leading to some hurt feelings. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, so there's a long-term commitment. The girlfriend has been insecure about her body, specifically her chest size, and this insecurity is old. She even tried on lingerie that didn't fit well, which made her feel worse.\n\nThe boyfriend didn't mention his preference for bigger chests before because he thought it wasn't an issue. But when she asked directly, he was honest about not being attracted to her chest size. He prefers bigger, but he said it's not a turn-off, just not a turn-on. This honesty caused her to feel hurt and like he lied, even though he didn't bring it up before.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and the impact of his honesty. In relationships, communication is crucial. If someone has specific preferences that affect their partner's feelings, it's important to discuss them, especially when the partner is already insecure about those areas. The boyfriend might not have realized that his silence was contributing to her insecurities. By finally telling her, he might have thought he was being honest, but it came as a surprise and hurt her.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was trying on lingerie that didn't fit and felt unattractive suggests that this was a sensitive topic for her. The boyfriend's response could have been more empathetic. Even if he's honest, the way he delivered the truth might have been harsh. Relationships require balancing honesty with compassion. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend admitted he didn't know what to say and was just being honest. While honesty is important, it's also about how it's communicated and whether it's done in a way that considers the other person's feelings. If he hadn't brought it up before, it's possible that she felt he was being dishonest by not addressing it when she was struggling with her self-image.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier, even if they weren't a deal-breaker. His honesty was late and delivered in a way that hurt her. He should have addressed her insecurities when he noticed them instead of waiting until she asked directly. The impact of his words caused her emotional pain, which is significant in a long-term relationship.\n"
