We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend being insecure about her body, specifically her chest size, and the author being honest about not being attracted to that aspect. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for three years. The girlfriend has always been insecure about her flat chest, and the author hasn't commented on it before. Now, when she brings it up, he's honest that he prefers a bigger chest and that it's not a turn on for him. She's hurt because he didn't mention this earlier.\n\nHmm, communication is key in relationships. The author is being honest, which is good, but timing and approach matter. He didn't address this issue when she was bringing it up before. Now, when she's vulnerable and asking for reassurance, he's revealing something that could hurt her feelings. Even if it's the truth, it's possible that the way he delivered it was harsh. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's facing away from her during intercourse might have been a subtle clue for her. But maybe he didn't realize how it could be perceived. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she was seeking validation and instead received a blow to her self-esteem. \n\nThe author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of lying or being fake, but he could have handled it more sensitively. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences earlier, especially since she's been insecure about this. By waiting until she's already upset, it comes off as insensitive. \n\nSo, balancing honesty with empathy is important. The author's intention was to be truthful, but he didn't consider how it would affect her emotionally. In relationships, there's a balance between being honest and being kind. In this case, the author's honesty caused hurt, which suggests he might have been the asshole (AITA) because he didn't approach the conversation with enough care and empathy, considering her feelings and history of insecurity.\n"
