We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man not being attracted to his girlfriend's body type, specifically her chest size. He mentions she's the first thin person he's been with, and he prefers bigger chests. He was honest with her, which upset her, leading her to leave and feel hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Honesty is important, but how it's delivered matters. He waited until after an incident where she was already insecure (trying on lingerie that didn't fit) to bring up his preference. That timing might be an issue. He says he's being honest, but if he's been with her for three years and never mentioned this before, it could feel like a betrayal. People often expect their partners to be supportive of their insecurities rather than adding to them.\n\nAlso, the fact that he faces away from her during intercourse might have already been a sign to her that there's something off, but he didn't address it. His honesty came as a shock, which she might see as a lie because he didn't bring it up earlier. The key here is whether his honesty was communicated in a way that's considerate of her feelings and the established relationship. \n\nAnother angle is that attraction can be complex, and preferences are valid. However, relationships require mutual respect and support. If his preference is affecting her self-esteem and the relationship dynamics, it's something that needs to be handled carefully. The question is whether his truth was communicated in a way that harms her emotional well-being. \n\nIn many cases, relationship experts advise couples to address such issues early and with empathy. Since he waited until a vulnerable moment, it's possible that his approach was inconsiderate. Even if his feelings are genuine, the timing and the impact on her are critical factors. \n\nSo, while he might not be entirely wrong in having his preferences, the way he communicated them and the context in which he did so likely caused unnecessary hurt. That would suggest he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
