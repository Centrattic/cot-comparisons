We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body. They've been in a 3-year relationship, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The main issue is her chest size and his attraction.\n\nHe mentions that he prefers bigger chests and that this is why he faces away during sex. She felt hurt and like he lied because he didn't bring it up before. Now, he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but so is how and when you bring up sensitive topics. He admitted he didn't know what to say and was being honest. But timing and context matter. She brought up the topic first, asking if he was okay with her flat chest. She was already insecure about it. He responded honestly, which made her feel hurt. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) She initiated the conversation about her insecurities. 2) He was honest but maybe didn't express it in a way that was considerate of her feelings. 3) The fact that he preferred bigger chests and that's why he faces away during sex might come off as dismissive, especially if this is the first time he's mentioned it. \n\nIn relationships, even if something is true, the way it's communicated can affect the other person. He didn't lie, but he might not have approached it with enough empathy. Also, the fact that he's only now bringing this up after three years could imply that he didn't consider her feelings enough in the past. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his preferences, which is reasonable. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of hurting someone, especially when they're already insecure. The way he handled it might have been a mistake, but the act of being honest isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He was honest, which is good, but maybe he didn't handle it with enough sensitivity. Since she felt hurt and lied to, it's possible he's at fault for not being more empathetic in his communication. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider how his honesty would affect her, even though he was truthful.\n"
