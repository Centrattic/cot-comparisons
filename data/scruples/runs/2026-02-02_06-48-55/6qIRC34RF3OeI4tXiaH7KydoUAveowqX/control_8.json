We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's body type, specifically her chest size, and being honest about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The couple has been together for three years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is the first time the guy has been with someone like that. She's been insecure about her chest size, and he admitted he prefers bigger. She felt hurt and that he lied by not bringing it up earlier.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should think about communication in relationships. Being honest is important, but timing and sensitivity matter. The guy didn't mention this preference before, even though she was already insecure. By not addressing it, he might have let her go without knowing his preference for three years. When he finally did say it, it came as a surprise and hurt her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was trying on lingerie and feeling insecure adds context. Maybe he could have found a way to reassure her earlier instead of just being blunt. The fact that he usually prefers facing away during sex because of her chest size suggests he's been avoiding the issue for a while. His honesty is valid, but the way and timing of the communication might be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is good, but it's also about how you communicate sensitive topics. If he didn't express his feelings before, especially when she was already insecure, that could be seen as not supporting her. So even if his feelings are genuine, the fact that he didn't address this in a more supportive way might make him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
