We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The couple has been together for three years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is different from the guy's past partners. She asked him about his attraction to her chest, leading to the conversation where he admitted he prefers bigger chests. She felt hurt because he hadn't mentioned this before and felt lied to. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is crucial. The author didn't bring up this preference earlier despite being in a long-term relationship. While it's true that attraction can vary, not addressing this issue when it's affecting his partner's feelings might be a problem. The girlfriend's insecurity is significant here; she's been trying on lingerie and feeling insecure about her body. The author's honesty might be valid, but timing and how it's communicated matter. By not discussing his preferences sooner, especially since they've been together for three years, it could be seen as insensitive. He should have addressed her insecurities proactively instead of waiting for her to bring it up. Additionally, the fact that it upset her and made her feel unattractive suggests that his approach was hurtful. Even if he's truthful, the way he delivered the information without prior discussion might be at fault. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he failed to communicate his feelings earlier, contributing to her emotional distress.\n"
