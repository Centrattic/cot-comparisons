We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend asked if he was okay with her flat chest. He admitted he prefers bigger chests and that he doesn't find her chest size attractive. She felt hurt because he didn't mention this before, leading her to feel lied to. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author is being honest, which is important, but timing and empathy matter. He waited until she brought up the insecurity, which seems like a vulnerable moment. By being honest then, he might have hurt her feelings unintentionally. The fact that he didn't bring this up before could be an issue. Relationships require both partners to feel valued and confident. If he's been with her for three years and never expressed this preference, it might have been better to address it earlier in a supportive way rather than when she's already insecure.\n\nAlso, his response about preferring bigger chests and facing away during intimacy could come off as dismissive of her feelings. He needs to balance honesty with compassion. Maybe there was a way to affirm her attractiveness while expressing his preferences without making her feel inadequate. The key here is whether his honesty was delivered in a way that respects her feelings. Since his honesty caused her pain, even if he didn't mean to, it's possible he's in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his honesty was delivered without sufficient consideration for her feelings and could have been communicated more thoughtfully to maintain her confidence in the relationship.\n"
