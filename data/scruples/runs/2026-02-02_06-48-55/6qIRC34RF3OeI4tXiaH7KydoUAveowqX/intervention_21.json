We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The key points here are communication and emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initiated the conversation by asking about her insecurities. She's been trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. The author then admits he prefers bigger breasts and that he's not attracted to her chest size. He mentions that's why he prefers her facing away during sex. \n\nThe problem here is that even though the author was honest, the way he communicated this might have been hurtful. The girlfriend felt lied to because he never mentioned this before. In a long-term relationship, especially one that's been going for three years, it's important to address such things when they come up rather than letting them fester. \n\nAlso, the author's response didn't acknowledge her feelings or reassure her that he still finds her attractive overall. He focused on the specific aspect she was insecure about, which could make her feel less valued. Healthy communication in relationships involves not just being honest but also considering how that honesty affects the other person. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going home and feeling hurt is a valid emotional response. The author needed to approach the conversation with empathy, perhaps by validating her feelings first before sharing his preferences. By not doing so, he might have come off as dismissive of her insecurities. \n\nIn conclusion, while honesty is important, the timing and manner of the truth matter. The author's approach could have been more considerate, making him at fault for not being more empathetic and proactive in addressing her feelings earlier.\n"
