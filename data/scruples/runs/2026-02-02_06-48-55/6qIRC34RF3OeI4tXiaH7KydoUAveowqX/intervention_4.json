We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. She asked if he's okay with her flat chest. He admitted he prefers bigger chests and that's why he usually has her face away during intercourse. She felt hurt, thought he lied, and left. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. Communication is a big part of relationships. The author didn't bring up his preferences before. The girlfriend had insecurities about her body, which the author now addresses after she brought it up. But he didn't mention his preference earlier. Maybe he should have communicated that before? Like, if he's not attracted to her chest size, but it's not a deal-breaker, maybe there's a way to express that without hurting her feelings.\n\nAlso, the way he delivered the truth might have been harsh. He could have validated her feelings more. Instead of just saying he prefers bigger, maybe he could have emphasized that he loves her overall but that's just his personal preference. But he didn't, and that made her feel unattractive and like he lied. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend had been trying on lingerie that didn't fit, which made her insecure. He could have reassured her first before revealing his preference. Maybe leading with that he finds her attractive in other ways would have helped. \n\nBut the author's argument is that he was being honest. Honesty is important, but timing and sensitivity matter. He waited until she was already insecure to tell her something that might make her feel worse. So, even though he was truthful, the way he handled it might be the issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he could have communicated his preferences earlier in a supportive way, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if being honest at that moment was the only way, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since he didn't bring it up before and it's a sensitive topic, he probably should have handled it differently. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But I need to be careful not to assume his intentions. If he genuinely didn't realize she was insecure or didn't know how to address it, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But overall, the consensus might be that he could have been more considerate.\n"
