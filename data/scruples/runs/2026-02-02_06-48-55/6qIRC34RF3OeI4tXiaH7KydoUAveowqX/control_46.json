We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. She's the first thin person he's been with, and she's petite and has a flat chest. He's more used to being with women with bigger chests.\n\nThe problem started when she asked if he was okay with her flat chest. He told her honestly that he doesn't find her chest size attractive and prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt, thought he was lying about not bringing it up before, and decided to go home. He's now questioning if he was the asshole.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication in a relationship. He's being honest about his preferences, but maybe didn't consider how it would affect her feelings. They've been together for three years, so she's had insecurities about her body for a while. He never brought it up before, which might have made her think he was more accepting than he actually was. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's also being honest. Relationships require honesty, but maybe the way he communicated it was harsh. When she asked specifically, he had to be truthful. However, he could have framed it differently, maybe emphasizing that he likes her for other things, not just her chest. \n\nAlso, she was trying on lingerie and had a mental funk about her appearance. Maybe he could have reassured her more instead of just stating his preference. The fact that he uses her facing away during sex is something he didn't mention before, which might have made her feel like he's been hiding things. \n\nBut is he wrong for being honest? Or is the issue about not being sensitive enough? The question is whether he's the asshole. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship dynamics. Since they both care about each other, maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate his feelings in a way that was supportive. \n\nSo, considering that he didn't mention his preference before, leading her to believe he was okay with it, and then bringing it up when she was already insecure could be seen as the asshole move. He should have addressed it earlier if it was a concern. But if he's just being honest now, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the main issue is that he didn't consider her feelings when he gave his answer. Even though he's honest, being honest in a way that hurts someone can be problematic if there's no consideration. So, maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he could have been more thoughtful in his approach.\n"
