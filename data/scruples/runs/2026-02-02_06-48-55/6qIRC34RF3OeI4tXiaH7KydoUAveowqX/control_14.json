We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. They've been dating for three years, and he never mentioned this before. Now she's hurt and feels lied to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. The guy says he's been honest, but he didn't bring up this issue before. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences earlier, especially if it affects their intimacy. The girlfriend was insecure about her body, and the guy didn't address it, which might have made her feel unappreciated. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is being honest now, but timing matters. If he brought it up suddenly without prior communication, it could hurt her feelings. Also, the fact that he prefers a bigger chest and that's why he prefers her facing away during sex\u2014this might have been something he could have addressed more sensitively. \n\nThe key points here are honesty vs. timing and sensitivity. In relationships, communication is key. If he had mentioned his preferences earlier, maybe they could have found a way to make each other feel good. Now, bringing it up after three years without prior discussion might come off as a lie because he didn't mention it before. \n\nSo, the guy might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier, leading to hurt feelings. The answer might be A, but I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, is it his responsibility to mention such preferences? Or is the girlfriend overreacting? But considering the girlfriend's insecurities, the lack of communication from the guy could have made her feel undervalued. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
