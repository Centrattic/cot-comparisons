We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy is asking if he's the asshole for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been together for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he usually prefers a bigger chest.\n\nFirst, the situation: She asked him if he was okay with her flat chest, which she's always been insecure about. He admitted he prefers bigger, but said it's not a turn-off. Then he mentioned he prefers her facing away during sex. She felt hurt, thinking he lied because he didn't bring it up before.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Communication is key in relationships. He didn't lie; he was honest, but maybe he didn't consider the timing or her feelings. She had been trying on lingerie and felt insecure, so bringing up his preference in that moment might not have been the best approach. However, honesty is important too. The problem might be that he didn't address her insecurities earlier or in a more supportive way.\n\nHe didn't hide his preference until that night. But bringing it up when she was already feeling insecure could be seen as insensitive. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences in a more constructive way, focusing on her other attractions rather than just stating what he doesn't like. Also, not facing her during sex because of her chest size might make her feel unattractive. His response could have been more reassuring, emphasizing that he likes her as a person, not just her body.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether his honesty was necessary in that moment and how he delivered it. But since he was honest and didn't lie before, maybe it's a B (not in the wrong). However, the way he delivered the information might have been hurtful, so maybe A (in the wrong). But the key point is that he was truthful. However, the way he handled it could have been better. Maybe the answer is A because he didn't consider her feelings and brought it up in a sensitive moment without being supportive. Alternatively, B because he was honest and didn't lie.\n"
