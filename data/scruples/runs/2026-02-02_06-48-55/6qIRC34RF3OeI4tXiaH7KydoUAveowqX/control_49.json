We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. The man admitted he prefers bigger chests and that he's not attracted to her size. But he didn't bring this up before, even though she was already insecure about it. He was honest, but maybe the timing or the way he communicated it was hurtful. \n\nHe said he didn't know how to tell her before. But in a 3-year relationship, if there are concerns about physical attraction, it's important to address them respectfully. His girlfriend felt lied to because he hadn't mentioned it, which is a valid reaction. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was trying on lingerie and was already insecure makes the situation more sensitive. Bringing up this preference at that moment, especially when she's vulnerable, might not be the best approach. \n\nHowever, he was honest and upfront, which is important in a relationship. But honesty needs to be paired with empathy. Maybe he could have approached the conversation differently, focusing on his feelings without making her feel inadequate. \n\nThe key points are: 1) He didn't communicate his preferences before, leading her to feel lied to. 2) He brought it up when she was already insecure. 3) His response was direct but potentially hurtful. \n\nSo, while honesty is good, the way he communicated it and the timing might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, he's partly at fault. But is he the asshole? The options are A or B. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. His intent was honesty, but the impact was hurting her feelings. She's been dealing with insecurity, and he could have handled it better. However, he's not entirely in the wrong because he's being honest. \n\nBut the fact that he didn't bring it up before and then brought it up in a situation where she was already vulnerable might make him the asshole. The answer might be A. But I'm a bit torn. Maybe the community would say he's not the asshole because he was honest but should have handled it better. Hmm. Wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the asshole, then B. But I think the answer could be A because he didn't consider her feelings enough. The fact that she felt lied to is significant. So maybe A.\n"
