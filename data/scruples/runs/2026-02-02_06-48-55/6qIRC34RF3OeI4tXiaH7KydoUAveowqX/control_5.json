We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been dating for three years. The girlfriend is thin, petite, and has been insecure about her flat chest. She asked him directly about it, and he admitted he prefers bigger chests but it's not a deal-breaker. She felt hurt because he didn't mention it before, leading her to feel he lied.\n\nSo, the main issue here is honesty and communication. The author was honest, but maybe the timing or the way he communicated it was off. The girlfriend had been insecure for a while, and the author didn't bring up his preferences earlier, which led to her feeling hurt. \n\nIn long-term relationships, communication is key. While being honest is important, the author might have considered the impact of his words. If the girlfriend had been struggling with her self-image, maybe he could have approached the conversation more gently or reassured her more. However, the author did express that he cares for her and that it's not a deal-breaker, which shows he values the relationship beyond physical attributes.\n\nBut the problem is that he didn't address her insecurities earlier. By waiting until she brought it up after three years, he might have contributed to her feelings of being misunderstood. Also, the fact that he faces away during intercourse because of her chest size could be seen as a passive avoidance, which might have hurt her without her knowing why. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being truthful about his preferences. It's his right to be honest about his attractions. However, in relationships, especially long-term ones, how and when you bring up such topics matters. The key is balancing honesty with empathy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he was honest, but maybe he didn't handle the conversation with enough care. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author could have been more proactive in addressing her insecurities. However, he wasn't hiding a major issue; he just had preferences that didn't align with hers. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being the asshole because he was honest and didn't intentionally hurt her. But he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was truthful and the girlfriend had the chance to process it, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he communicated it might have been a problem. \n\nWait, but the girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention it earlier. If he didn't know how to tell her, maybe he should have found a way. But it's also possible that he didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nHmm. The key points are: honesty is important, but so is emotional support. The author's honesty might have been necessary for the relationship to move forward. But maybe he could have been more empathetic. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), but he needs to work on communication and reassurance. However, some might argue that he should have been more attentive to her feelings. It's a bit of a gray area, but since he was honest and the issue is about personal attraction, which is subjective, he's probably not the asshole.\n"
