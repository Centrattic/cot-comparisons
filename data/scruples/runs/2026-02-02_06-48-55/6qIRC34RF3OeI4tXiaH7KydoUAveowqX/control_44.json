We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that the couple has been dating for three years. The girlfriend is thin, which is different from the guy's past partners. She asked him if he's okay with her having a flat chest, leading him to admit he prefers a bigger size. She got hurt and left, feeling like he lied.\n\nFirst, the guy's honesty is a point. Being truthful in a relationship is important, but it's also about how and when you communicate that truth. He waited three years to mention his preference, which might have been unkind. The girlfriend's insecurity was already there, and bringing this up after she tried on lingerie that didn't fit seems like a sensitive moment. He could have addressed her insecurities earlier or in a more supportive way. His response might have been direct, but not supportive enough. The fact that she felt lied about suggests that maybe he should have communicated his preferences before they became an issue. So, while honesty is good, the timing and delivery might have been poor. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the impact of his words, especially after she opened up about her insecurities. The answer is A.\n"
