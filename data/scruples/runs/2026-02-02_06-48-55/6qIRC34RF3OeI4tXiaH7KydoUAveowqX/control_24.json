We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that the girlfriend asked if he's okay with her flat chest, and he told her he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt and thought he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for almost 3 years. Communication is key in relationships, especially when it comes to intimacy and attraction. The author didn't mention his preference before, so bringing it up suddenly might have caught her off guard. But why didn't he talk about it earlier? Maybe he thought it wasn't important or didn't want to hurt her feelings. However, not communicating such a thing could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe girlfriend had been insecure about her body, as mentioned. She tried on lingerie and felt insecure again. When she asked, he was honest but maybe not in a way that was supportive. His honesty might be truthful, but the way he delivered it could have been more empathetic. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have affirmed her attractiveness while explaining his preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that he mentioned preferring bigger chests and faces away during intercourse might make her feel inadequate. Even if it's the truth, the impact on her self-esteem is significant. The key here is whether the author's honesty was necessary in that context and if there was a more thoughtful way to communicate it. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but it's also about how you communicate and considering the other person's feelings. By not addressing this before, he might have contributed to her insecurity without giving her reassurance. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being open about his preferences earlier and for not handling the conversation with more care, leading to hurt feelings.\n"
