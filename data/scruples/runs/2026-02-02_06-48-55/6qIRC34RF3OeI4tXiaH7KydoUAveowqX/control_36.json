We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. They're a guy who's been with his girlfriend for three years and admitted that he's not attracted to her flat chest, preferring a bigger size. He shared this after she asked him about it, which led to her feeling hurt and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They care about each other, so communication is key. The author was honest, which is important, but the way he delivered the information might have been hurtful. His partner had been insecure about her body, and bringing this up after she expressed her insecurities could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAlso, he mentioned that he's the first thin person he's been with, which might mean he didn't realize how his preferences could affect her self-esteem. However, honesty in relationships is usually praised, but it needs to be balanced with empathy. The fact that he didn't know how to handle it and ended up hurting her suggests he might not have considered the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, he didn't lie. He was upfront about his preferences, which is part of a healthy relationship. But maybe he could have handled it more delicately. The question is whether his honesty crossed into being an asshole. The answer might depend on whether his communication was kind and supportive despite the truth.\n\nIn conclusion, while honesty is important, the way he communicated his preferences without addressing her feelings could make him the asshole. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. Alternatively, if the community values honesty over hurt feelings, the answer might be B. But since she felt lied to and he didn't address her insecurities properly, A seems more likely.\n"
