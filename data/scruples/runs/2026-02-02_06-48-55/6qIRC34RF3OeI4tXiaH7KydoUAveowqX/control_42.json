We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest, and how he communicated that to her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple has been together for three years, they care about each other, but the guy has a preference for bigger chests and hasn't mentioned this before. His girlfriend is insecure about her body, especially her chest size. When she brings up the topic, he's honest but it upsets her.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, honesty, and how the information was delivered. The girlfriend felt hurt and lied to because the guy didn't mention his preference earlier. He says he was being honest, which is important. But in a long-term relationship, not discussing something that affects intimacy could be an issue. \n\nIs he in the wrong for not bringing it up before? Maybe. Partners should feel comfortable discussing their preferences, especially if they affect the other person's feelings. However, he didn't lie; he was just being honest when asked. The problem might be that he didn't address her insecurities proactively. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is understandable. She's insecure and the comment about preferring bigger chests might have reinforced her insecurities. The way he communicated it could have been more sensitive. For example, he could have emphasized his attraction to her other features or reassured her. \n\nThe guy's response was honest, but honesty without empathy can be hurtful. In relationships, how you communicate is as important as the content. So, while he isn't entirely in the wrong for being honest, he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe girlfriend feels lied to because he didn't mention this before. But he didn't lie; he just didn't bring it up. So maybe he isn't in the wrong for being honest, but he could have been more considerate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he was truthful, but the situation requires more nuance. However, in the context of the question, which is asking if he's the asshole, the judgment might lean towards A if his honesty was unkind. But the user's options are A or B. \n\nThe key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the problem is that he was honest but could have been more sensitive, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the problem is that he didn't address her insecurities and his preference affected their intimacy, then maybe he is. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and he should have considered her feelings when responding. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is emotional support. By not addressing her insecurities earlier or framing his preference in a way that doesn't hurt her, he might be at fault. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his communication was hurtful and he didn't consider her feelings. Alternatively, if the answer is B, because he was honest and it's not his fault for not lying. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. The user's example might be more leaning towards A because the girlfriend felt lied to, and the author didn't handle the communication well. But the answer depends on whether the action (being honest but hurtfully) is considered wrong. In this case, the answer might be A. However, some might argue that being honest isn't wrong, hence B. \n\nLooking at similar scenarios, often in these situations, if someone is honest but doesn't consider the other person's feelings, it's still seen as hurtful but not necessarily the asshole. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's intention was honesty. The answer might be B. But in the context of the question, the answer is likely A. Wait, but the user's options are A (the author is in the wrong) and B (not). \n\nGiven that the user is asking for a judgment, the answer would likely be A because the author's honesty was delivered in a way that hurt the girlfriend and didn't consider her insecurities. Even though he was honest, the way he communicated it was unkind. So, the answer is A. But I need to be sure. In the context of \"Am I the asshole?\", the community often considers intent and harm. If the harm was unnecessary, then the person might be the asshole. Here, the author's honesty caused harm, but he might not be the asshole if he didn't have bad intent. The answer might be B. \n\nWait, the girlfriend felt lied to because the author didn't mention this before. But he didn't lie; he just didn't bring up his preference. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not lying. However, he should have considered her feelings and maybe addressed her insecurities earlier. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with care, leading to hurt feelings, even if he was honest. But if the answer is based on whether he lied, then B. The key is the impact on the girlfriend. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is A.\n"
