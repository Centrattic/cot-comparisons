We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating almost three years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is different from the guy's previous partners who were bigger. She asked him about his attraction to her chest because she's insecure. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones, which made her feel hurt and led her to leave. He's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy didn't mention his preference before, even though they've been together for a long time. He says it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on either. She felt lied to because he never brought it up. His honesty might have been necessary, but the timing and context matter. Was he supposed to avoid the topic to protect her feelings, or was he right to be honest? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. But when does honesty become hurtful? If he's been with her for three years and never mentioned this preference before, maybe he could have addressed it earlier in a more supportive way. By bringing it up after she tried on lingerie and was already insecure, it might have been a bad time. The fact that she felt hurt and he didn't see it coming could indicate a lack of emotional awareness. \n\nAlso, her insecurities were already present. The guy's admission might have triggered her negative self-image. Even if he's truthful, the way he delivered it might have been careless. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the issue isn't just about his preference but how it affected her self-esteem. \n\nOn the other hand, he did say he prefers bigger chests, which is his personal taste. But in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration. He might not be wrong about his feelings, but the way he handled the disclosure could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate this preference sooner and his honest answer, while truthful, was delivered in a way that hurt her feelings. The longer they're together, the more important it is to address such issues before they become a problem, especially when the partner is already insecure. He could have framed it more positively, acknowledging her other qualities and not focusing solely on the aspect that made her feel bad. Therefore, answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
