We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's chest size, which she found hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. They've been dating for three years. The girlfriend has long been insecure about her flat chest, which is a known issue. The guy never mentioned his preference for a bigger chest before, and when she asked, he was honest but didn't frame it in a way that was comforting. \n\nThe key points are: She already had insecurities, he didn't address them before, and his blunt honesty upset her. In relationships, communication is crucial, especially regarding sensitive topics. Even if he's honest, the timing and manner matter. Since she had been trying on lingerie and was in a mental funk, bringing up his preference without being supportive could have been hurtful. \n\nHe might not be wrong in feeling that way, but the way he communicated it was an issue. The girlfriend's feelings of being lied to suggest that he didn't express his needs in a way that acknowledged her insecurities. The correct answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with care and empathy, leading to emotional harm.\n"
