We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's not attracted to his girlfriend's flat chest and told her so, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They've been dating for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he prefers bigger chests. She asked him about how he feels regarding her chest size, and he told her honestly that he isn't attracted to it. She felt hurt and thought he lied because he never mentioned it before. \n\nHmm. Communication in relationships is important. The guy was honest, but maybe the timing or the way he communicated it was an issue. He didn't bring it up before, so bringing it up suddenly could be hurtful. Also, she had been trying on lingerie and was already insecure. Maybe he should have addressed her insecurities earlier instead of just giving a direct answer after she asked.\n\nBut he did say he's honest. However, in relationships, honesty needs to be balanced with consideration for the other person's feelings. If he knew she was insecure about her body, he might have approached the topic more gently or reassured her instead of just stating his preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers facing away during intercourse because of her chest size suggests that he's been avoiding certain positions for a while. If he didn't mention this before, she might feel like he's not been truthful about his feelings. \n\nSo, while he might be telling the truth, not addressing her insecurities or his preferences earlier could make him seem inconsiderate. The way he handled the conversation might have been abrupt. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the person acted with consideration. Here, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate this important aspect of his preferences earlier, leading to hurt feelings. Even though he's honest, the timing and the impact on her self-esteem are factors. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
