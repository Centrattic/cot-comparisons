We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The key points here are about honesty in a relationship and how it affects the partner's feelings.\n\nFirst, the guy has been with his girlfriend for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with people with a bigger chest. When she asked if he was okay with her flat chest, he admitted he prefers bigger and that he faces away during sex. She got upset, felt hurt, and he's now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHonesty is important in relationships, but so is communication and sensitivity. He waited three years to bring this up. That seems like a long time. By not discussing this issue earlier, he might have contributed to her insecurity. She mentioned she's always been insecure about her chest, so maybe he could have addressed it in a more supportive way earlier on.\n\nBut he did tell her the truth, which is that he's not attracted to her chest size. However, the way he communicated it might have been blunt. He could have been more considerate, maybe framed it in a way that reassures her about other aspects of her attractiveness. Instead, he just stated his preference without considering how it would make her feel. \n\nAlso, the fact that he faces away during intercourse because of her chest size suggests that this has been an ongoing issue he didn't address, which could have led to her feeling unattractive. Not talking about it for three years might have made it worse when he finally did mention it. \n\nSo, on one hand, he's being honest about his preferences, which is valid. On the other hand, not addressing the issue earlier and not being empathetic in his delivery might have caused her emotional pain. The question is whether his honesty was necessary at that moment and how he could have handled it better. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance honesty with kindness. If he was concerned about her feeling insecure, maybe he could have approached it differently. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have expressed appreciation for other aspects of her body and how he values their relationship beyond physical attributes. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he waited too long to bring it up and didn't communicate it in a way that protects her feelings. Alternatively, it could be B (not in the wrong) because he was honest, which is important. But given the context of her existing insecurities and the long time he waited, I think the answer leans towards A.\n"
