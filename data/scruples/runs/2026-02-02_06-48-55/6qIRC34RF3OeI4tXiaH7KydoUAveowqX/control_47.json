We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's body type, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The guy mentions he's never really commented on her chest before, and when she asked, he was honest but it hurt her feelings. The girlfriend felt like he lied because he didn't bring it up earlier. \n\nIn relationships, how and when you share such preferences matters. Even if it's the truth, bringing it up suddenly after years might feel like a betrayal. The guy could have been more considerate in his approach. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences earlier or handled it more sensitively. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's insecurity is a factor. She's been insecure about her body, and his comment might have triggered that. It's important to address insecurities with care. The guy's honesty might be truthful, but the way he delivered it could have been hurtful. \n\nIs honesty an excuse here? Maybe, but communication style is key. The girlfriend felt hurt and lied to, which affects trust. The guy needs to take responsibility for not being more tactful. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like it's a mix of both. He's honest but didn't handle it well. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to see if the community usually sides on communication issues here. In AITA scenarios, being honest but causing pain can be tricky. However, if the issue could have been discussed in a kinder way, the person might be at fault for not doing that. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences in a way that considered his girlfriend's feelings and addressed her insecurities. He should have been more thoughtful and maybe discussed it earlier or found a better way to express his honesty without hurting her.\n"
