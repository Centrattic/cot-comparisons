We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She's petite and flat-chested. He's more into bigger chests, which is why he prefers her facing away during sex. She brought up the issue when she noticed he never commented on her chest, after trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. He told her honestly he prefers bigger ones, which she took as a hurtful comment, leading to tension.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, communication in relationships is key. The author said he was honest, but maybe the way he approached it was too direct. He didn't mention that he still finds her attractive overall or that he values her in other ways. He didn't acknowledge her feelings of insecurity before stating his preference. That might have made her feel unappreciated. Also, keeping this to himself for three years without addressing it, even if he thought it wasn't a deal-breaker, might have been a missed opportunity to reassure her. However, he did share it when she asked, which shows he was honest. The problem could be in the delivery and the lack of sensitivity. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but there's room for him to have handled it better. But according to the rules, the answer should be A or B. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that honesty is important but how it's delivered matters, perhaps the answer is A because he should have been more considerate in his approach, even if his feelings are valid.\n"
