We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The main issue here is communication and how he handled the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend approached him about her insecurities regarding her chest size. She noticed he didn't comment on it and had been trying on lingerie that didn't fit. She was vulnerable and seeking reassurance. The author then told her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size, preferring bigger ones. He mentioned it's not a deal-breaker but isn't a turn-on. She felt hurt and said he lied to her because he hadn't brought this up before. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: communication styles, emotional impact, and relationship dynamics. In long-term relationships, honesty is important, but so is how you deliver that honesty. The author could have anticipated that bringing up a preference he never mentioned before might hurt her, especially since she's already insecure about it. Timing and context matter. If he waited until after three years to mention this, it might come as a surprise and feel dismissive of her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers bigger chests but she's flat is a physical preference. However, in relationships, emotional connection and communication are crucial. The way he delivered the honesty might have been too direct without considering her feelings. He should have addressed her insecurities earlier if they were aware of his preferences. \n\nOn the other hand, he did tell her the truth, which is important for the relationship's health. But the method and timing could have been better. Maybe he should have framed it in a way that emphasizes his attraction to other qualities, not just focusing on the one aspect she's insecure about. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He wasn't dishonest initially, but bringing up this preference in response to her insecurities might have been unkind. The way he communicated it could have been more sensitive. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, as he could have handled the situation more thoughtfully.\n"
