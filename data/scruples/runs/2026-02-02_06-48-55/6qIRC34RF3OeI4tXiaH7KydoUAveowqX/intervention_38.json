We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating almost 3 years, and the girlfriend is petite with a flat chest. The author has been with bigger girls before, prefers bigger chests. The girlfriend brought up the issue when she noticed he didn't comment on her chest, and he admitted he's not into her size. She felt hurt because he never mentioned it before, and now he's facing her away during sex. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and how he handled the conversation. He made an account on AITA (Am I the Asshole) to ask, which is a common place people go for relationship advice. The girlfriend was insecure about her body, and he didn't address it before. She tried on lingerie and felt bad, so she asked him. He told her the truth, but it hurt her feelings. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, communication is crucial in relationships. If she's been feeling insecure for a while and he never addressed it, maybe he should have brought it up earlier. But he says he was being honest. However, the way he delivered it might have been harsh. He didn't consider her feelings when he mentioned he prefers bigger chests. Even though he's being truthful, not being considerate in how he communicates that can be an issue. \n\nAlso, the fact that he faces her away during intercourse because of her chest size suggests that his attraction is affecting their intimacy. Maybe he should have considered how that affects her self-esteem. The girlfriend feeling like he lied is because he didn't mention his preferences before. In a long-term relationship, it's important to talk about these things early on, especially if it's affecting the relationship dynamics. \n\nOn the flip side, he's being honest, which is important, but honesty needs to be balanced with empathy. He might not be the asshole, but he definitely could have handled it better. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and if he's not attracted to her body, it's important to find a way to communicate that without hurting her. Maybe he should have approached it differently, focusing on his love for her while acknowledging the physical aspect. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If we consider that he's being honest but didn't consider her feelings and history of insecurity, then maybe he is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the reasoning is that he didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity. If B (no), it's because he was being honest. But the community often leans towards considering how actions affect others. Since he didn't address her insecurities before and his comment hurt her, he's at fault. So, the answer might be A.\n"
