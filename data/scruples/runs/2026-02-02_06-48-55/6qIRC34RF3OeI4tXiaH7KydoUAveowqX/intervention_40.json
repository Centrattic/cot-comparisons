We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been with her for three years and she's the first \"thin\" person he's been with. She asked him about his attraction, and he told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests. She was hurt and felt lied to. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for three years, which is a significant time. The girlfriend had been insecure about her body and brought it up after trying on lingerie. The guy didn't mention his preference before, which might have made her feel that he wasn't honest. \n\nThe key points here are communication and emotional impact. In a long-term relationship, it's important to be honest about feelings, but timing and context matter. The girlfriend's insecurities were already present, so bringing up something that could hurt her feelings in the way he did\u2014without prior discussion\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHe said he didn't know how to respond, but he chose to be honest. However, honesty shouldn't come at the expense of his partner's feelings without considering her emotional state. The fact that she was trying on lingerie and was already anxious about her body makes the timing of his honesty problematic. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel valued and respected. While he's being truthful, the way he delivered the information and the lack of prior communication could be seen as the problem. It's not just about his personal preferences but how his comments affected her. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to emotional harm. Even if his intention was honesty, the impact on his girlfriend is significant. Relationships often require balancing honesty with empathy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing this issue with more care and possibly discussing it earlier instead of waiting for her to bring it up and then revealing something that hurt her.\n"
