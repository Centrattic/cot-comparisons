We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the relationship is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The person mentioned that they prefer bigger chests and admitted that's why they face away during intercourse. The girlfriend felt hurt and like he lied because he never brought it up before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is key, but timing and sensitivity matter. The author did come clean after the girlfriend brought up her insecurities. However, the girlfriend was already in a mental funk due to her own insecurities. The author's directness might have been necessary, but the way he delivered it and the fact that he didn't address her feelings beforehand could be problematic.\n\nNext, emotional impact. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought he lied because he didn't mention his preference before. Even if he's honest, not addressing such a sensitive topic proactively can lead to hurt feelings. Partners often expect their significant others to be supportive of their insecurities rather than bringing up their own preferences that could exacerbate them.\n\nAlso, the act of facing away during intercourse. If the author is doing this because of her chest size, that's a valid issue. It might make the girlfriend feel unattractive or not desired in that aspect. The author's honesty is one thing, but the effect on the relationship dynamics is another. The girlfriend might feel that her partner isn't accepting of her body as it is, which is important for self-esteem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being truthful, which is important in a relationship. He didn't hide his preferences, and he came clean when asked. But maybe he should have addressed her insecurities more proactively instead of waiting for her to bring it up. Also, perhaps he could have been more supportive in his response, focusing on the positive aspects of her body rather than just stating his preference.\n\nIn terms of the rules of the situation, if the girlfriend expressed insecurity before, the author should have been more mindful of her feelings. Being honest is good, but it's also about how it's communicated and the context. If the author's preference is affecting their intimacy, that's a problem that needs to be navigated with care, maybe by finding ways to make her feel desired in other aspects.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's being honest, but he might not have handled the situation with enough sensitivity. The key issue is that his honesty, while necessary, was delivered in a way that hurt her feelings and didn't consider her existing insecurities. Therefore, he could be seen as partially at fault for not being supportive enough in his communication.\n"
