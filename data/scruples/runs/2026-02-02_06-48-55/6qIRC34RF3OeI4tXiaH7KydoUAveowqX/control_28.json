We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not being attracted to his girlfriend's chest size and telling her honestly. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is insecure about her body, especially her chest. The author mentions that he prefers bigger chests and that he's not into her flat chest. He told her this after she asked. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he didn't bring it up before. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but the way he communicated it might have been a problem.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. But timing and approach matter. The girlfriend had been insecure about this for a while, maybe even tried on lingerie and felt bad. The author's response was honest, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings. Just saying he's not attracted to her chest size without offering reassurance or validation could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, he mentioned that he prefers bigger chests and that he usually has them face away during intercourse. That might come off as dismissive. Even if it's true, the way he framed it could make her feel like her body isn't good enough. \n\nBut then again, the author was being honest. There's a balance between honesty and being kind. Maybe he should have approached the conversation more sensitively, focusing on her feelings rather than just stating his preferences. The girlfriend felt like he lied because he didn't mention it before, but maybe he didn't know how to bring it up. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he was honest but didn't handle it well. The fact that she felt hurt and he didn't consider the impact of his words might make him the asshole. On the other hand, he's also being truthful, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he communicated it and the lack of empathy could mean he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, because the author didn't consider his girlfriend's insecurities and communicated his preference in a way that hurt her, even if it was honest. The key here is empathy and how he handled the conversation.\n"
