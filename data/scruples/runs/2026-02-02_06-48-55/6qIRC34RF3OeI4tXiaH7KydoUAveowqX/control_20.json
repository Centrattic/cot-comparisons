We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He told her he prefers bigger chests, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He's never mentioned his preference before, and she asked him directly because she was insecure. He answered honestly but it hurt her feelings. \n\nCommunication is a big part of relationships. The author says he didn't know how to respond and just told the truth. But maybe the timing or the way he delivered the truth was harsh. She felt lied to because he never mentioned it before, even though he didn't bring it up. \n\nAlso, her insecurity is real. She was trying on lingerie and feeling unattractive. Bringing up his preference in that moment could have been unhelpful. Perhaps he should have reassured her first before stating his preferences. \n\nHe mentions that he prefers her facing away during intercourse. That might be a point where he could have addressed it earlier. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences in a more supportive way instead of when she was already feeling insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, being honest is important. He didn't lie; he just hadn't considered how his honesty would affect her. The issue here is about how to communicate preferences without hurting someone's feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the hurt feelings are there. Even if he's honest, the way he communicates it matters. He could have been more considerate of her insecurities. So maybe answer A, yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with care and consideration for her feelings.\n"
