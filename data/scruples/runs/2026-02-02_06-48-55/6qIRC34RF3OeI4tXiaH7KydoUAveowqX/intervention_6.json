We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the person not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author has been in a 3-year relationship and mentions that his current girlfriend is the first thin person he's been with. He prefers bigger chests and hasn't shown attraction to her flat chest. The girlfriend brought up the issue because she was insecure after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The author was honest about his preferences, which upset her because she felt lied to and hurt.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. Communication is key in any relationship. The author didn't raise this issue before, even though he's been with her for three years. That's a long time, and not discussing such a significant aspect of attraction might have caused hurt. The girlfriend felt unattractive and that her body didn't meet his standards, which is a valid feeling. The author's honesty is important, but timing and context matter. Bringing it up after the girlfriend is already insecure might have been harsh.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author prefers bigger chests and has been with bigger women before suggests that his attraction is based on specific preferences. However, in a long-term relationship, partners might adjust or accept each other's differences. The author might have been avoiding the issue for three years, which isn't healthy either. The girlfriend's insecurity is a result of not feeling attractive to her partner, which is a serious emotional issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his preferences. But honesty without consideration for the other person's feelings can still be harmful. The key here is that the author didn't communicate his preferences earlier, leading to the girlfriend's hurt. He didn't address her insecurities proactively but instead let it come up when she was already vulnerable.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? He was honest, but maybe he could have handled it differently. By keeping this unspoken for three years, he didn't support his girlfriend's self-esteem. The way he revealed it might have been unkind, especially after she was already trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. The fact that he admitted to preferring bigger chests and changing positions to avoid facing her could make her feel like her body isn't acceptable. \n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's insecurities. If the author's preferences were a deal-breaker, maybe he should have communicated earlier. But since he's in the relationship, not addressing it for three years and then bringing it up in a hurtful way might make him the asshole. The girlfriend has the right to feel hurt by not being his type, especially if it affects their intimacy. The author's lack of proactive communication and the context of the conversation likely contributed to the hurt feeling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). He didn't handle the communication well, didn't address the issue when it could have been less damaging, and his honesty came at a time that exacerbated her insecurities. Even though being honest is important, the way and timing are crucial here.\n"
