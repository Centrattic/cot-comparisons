We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked him directly about her insecurities. She's been trying on lingerie and felt insecure. The author then told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests and that she doesn't turn him on in that aspect. He mentioned that he usually prefers her facing away during sex.\n\nThe girlfriend felt hurt and thought he lied because he didn't mention this before. Communication in relationships is key. The author was honest, which is good, but maybe the timing or the way he delivered it was hurtful. However, he didn't lie; he just hadn't discussed it before. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because unaddressed insecurities can be sensitive. But the author's truth is also important. \n\nIs honesty a defense here? If he didn't know how she'd react, maybe he should have approached it more carefully. But he didn't avoid the issue. The fact that he made an anonymous account to ask shows he's seeking resolution. The question is whether his honesty makes him the asshole. \n\nIn relationships, partners have different preferences. The author's preference isn't a crime. However, not addressing her insecurities could be an issue. But he did address it when she brought it up. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because he was honest, but could have been more considerate. The answer would be B (No).\n"
