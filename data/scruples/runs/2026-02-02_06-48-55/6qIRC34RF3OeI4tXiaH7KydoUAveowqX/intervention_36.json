We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. He's the first one to be with a thin, petite partner, as he's usually been with women who have larger chests. The girlfriend approached him about her insecurities regarding her flat chest, mentioning she tried on lingerie that didn't fit and was feeling down. The author then told her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size, prefers bigger ones, and that's why he prefers her facing away during sex. She was hurt, felt lied to, and left. He's now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and how the truth was delivered. The author is being honest, but the context matters. The girlfriend's insecurities were already present, and she brought up the topic because she noticed he never commented on her chest. He responded with his preference, which was new information to her. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but timing and how you express it can affect things. The girlfriend felt hurt because this was unexpected and maybe she thought they were on the same page. The author didn't lie; he was truthful but perhaps didn't consider her feelings or the way to approach it. Also, preferring a certain body type is common, but bringing it up in a way that makes your partner feel inadequate can be problematic. \n\nThe fact that he mentioned preferring a different body type and that his actions (facing away) were influenced by that might have made her feel less valued. The response could have been more supportive, maybe acknowledging her insecurities first before stating his preference. The author's approach was blunt, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, while the author isn't lying, the way he communicated his preference without considering her feelings might make him the asshole here. The question is whether honesty excuses not being considerate. In AITA scenarios, the balance between honesty and empathy is crucial. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her insecurities were invalidated. The author's response might have been necessary for him, but the delivery was harsh. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his honesty wasn't delivered with enough empathy, causing hurt and damaging the relationship dynamic.\n"
