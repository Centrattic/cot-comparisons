We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body. The situation is that the girlfriend asked the author if he's okay with her flat chest. The author admitted he prefers bigger breasts and mentioned it's why he makes her face away during sex. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought he lied because he hadn't mentioned this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author is being honest about his preferences, which is important. However, the timing and the context might matter. The girlfriend was feeling insecure already because of her lingerie issue, so bringing up his preference in that moment could have been hurtful. Did he address it in a considerate way? Maybe he could have approached the topic more sensitively, especially since it's a sensitive issue for her.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's been with her for three years and this is the first time he's brought up his preference. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention it before. But is honesty the issue here, or the way it was delivered? If the author had communicated his preferences earlier, maybe she would have felt less blindsided. On the other hand, if he's being truthful now, is that fair?\n\nAnother angle: the author's preferences are valid, but the impact on his partner's feelings is significant. The girlfriend's insecurity is a red flag. The author could have handled it by reassuring her that his feelings for her aren't solely based on her body, while also expressing his preferences constructively. Maybe the problem is not the truth itself, but the lack of consideration for her feelings and the lack of prior communication about this aspect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), it's because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier or in a more supportive way. If B (no), because he's being honest about his preferences, and it's not his fault for having them. But the key here is how he communicated it. The question is whether honesty justifies the hurt caused. In relationships, communication matters a lot. Being honest is good, but it's also about how and when you do it. The author might not be in the wrong for being honest, but could have been more thoughtful in his approach. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be valid because of the impact on her self-esteem. \n\nThe community often considers both perspectives. The answer might lean towards A because the author's honesty caused hurt without prior discussion, leading to the girlfriend feeling unvalued. Or B if the author is just being honest and it's not his fault for having preferences. But the fact that the author didn't address this earlier and chose a moment when she was already insecure might tip the scales towards A. The girlfriend's feeling of being lied to is because the author didn't communicate this before, which is a valid reaction. So the author might be in the wrong for not handling the conversation better, even if his preferences are legitimate.\n"
