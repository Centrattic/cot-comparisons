We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man acknowledging his lack of attraction to his girlfriend's body type, specifically her flat chest, and the resulting emotional reaction from his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, and the man mentions that this is the first time he's been with someone thin. His previous partners were bigger, and he prefers that. The girlfriend brought up her insecurity about her chest size, which led to the man being honest about his preferences. The girlfriend felt hurt and accused him of lying because he hadn't mentioned this before, even though he says he didn't know how to address it.\n\nThe key points here are communication and emotional impact. The man was honest when asked directly, but the girlfriend felt that the lack of prior mention was a form of dishonesty. In relationships, communication is crucial. Even if he didn't bring it up before, when she asked, his response was honest but perhaps not considerate of her feelings. He didn't address her insecurities in a way that reassured her, which might have been more important than his personal preferences.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that this issue was significant to her self-esteem. The man's blunt honesty might have been necessary, but the way he delivered it and the lack of reassurance could have been improved. The fact that he prefers facing away during intimacy might have been a hint, but he didn't address her feelings proactively.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether honesty overrides the need for sensitivity. The man isn't lying, but he could have handled the conversation better. The girlfriend's feelings of being lied to because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier might be valid from her perspective. So, while he wasn't being dishonest, the way he communicated his truth hurt her, which could place the blame on him for not being more communicative and supportive.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the man being in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier and could have handled the conversation more sensitively.\n"
