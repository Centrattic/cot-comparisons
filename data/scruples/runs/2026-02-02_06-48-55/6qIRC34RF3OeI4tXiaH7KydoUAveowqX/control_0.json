We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's been with his girlfriend for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She's petite and flat-chested, and he's admitted he prefers bigger chests. He told her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size, which made her feel hurt and led to her leaving. She feels like he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nHmm. So first, communication in relationships is key. He didn't bring this up before, even though they've been together a while. That might be the issue. If he had preferences, it's important to discuss them, especially if they affect her self-esteem. But he said he's honest about it now. On the other hand, his honesty might have been delivered without considering her feelings. Maybe he could have phrased it differently, like focusing on other aspects he finds attractive.\n\nWait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he waited three years to bring this up could be problematic. If his preferences are affecting how he interacts during intimacy, like her facing away, that's something she might not have known. She tried on lingerie and felt insecure, so bringing it up after she already felt insecure might not be the best timing. Also, he didn't address her insecurities before, which could show a lack of emotional support.\n\nBut he did say he's honest, so maybe he's not at fault for being truthful. However, in relationships, honesty should be balanced with empathy. He might not be in the wrong for being honest, but maybe he could have handled it better. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on communication in relationships. If he didn't consider her feelings, maybe he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's just being honest, maybe not. But since he's been with her three years and never mentioned this before, causing her hurt feelings, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's wrong). Or B (No, he's not wrong).\n\nHmm. The key points are: he waited three years to talk about this, his comments were specific about her body part which she's insecure about, and he didn't support her by focusing on other aspects. So, even if he's honest, the way and timing might be the issue. So the answer might be A. But some people might say that honesty isn't wrong. It's a tough call. But given that he's been with her for a long time, and this affected her self-esteem, he should have addressed it earlier or more supportively. So AITA might lean towards A, but maybe not. Alternatively, if he's not in the wrong for being honest, then B. I think the answer is A because he didn't communicate his feelings before causing her hurt, even if it's truthful. But maybe not. I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is A.\n"
