We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. So, the user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been dating for three years. The girlfriend is thin, petite, and has a flat chest, which is different from the guy's previous partners who were bigger. The girlfriend brought up the topic when she noticed he didn't comment on her chest size. She was insecure because she tried on lingerie that didn't fit well in that area. The guy then told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests and that she facing away during sex is why he does that. She felt hurt and said he lied because he didn't bring this up before.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, communication is key. The guy says he was being honest, but the girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention this before. Even if he didn't mean to hide it, not discussing this preference earlier could have led to her insecurity. In a long-term relationship lasting three years, it's important to address such issues when they come up, especially if they affect the other person's self-esteem.\n\nThe girlfriend's insecurity seems valid here. She tried to bring up the topic because she noticed his silence. By not addressing his preference sooner, he might have contributed to her feeling insecure. When she asked directly, his response was honest but maybe not empathetic enough. He didn't consider how this might impact her emotionally until after she reacted. The fact that she felt hurt and that he didn't anticipate that reaction suggests that he could have handled the situation better.\n\nAlso, in relationships, especially after three years, partners should be open about their preferences, especially if those preferences affect the other person's feelings. The guy's honesty is good, but the timing and the way he delivered it might have been careless. He didn't take the time to reassure her or explain his feelings in a way that wouldn't hurt her. Instead, he just stated his preference, which led to her feeling unattractive and the situation escalating.\n\nSo, while being honest is important, the way he communicated it and not addressing her feelings adequately might make him the asshole here. He should have been more considerate of how his words would affect her, especially since she was already insecure about that aspect. The fact that he didn't bring this up before and only mentioned it when she directly asked could be seen as not being fully transparent, even if he was truthful in the moment.\n"
