We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's been with his girlfriend for almost three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he prefers a bigger chest size. She asked him if he's okay with her flat chest, and he told her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. He didn't bring up this preference before, even though they've been dating for a long time. That's a big point. If something is a deal-breaker or affects how he feels about her, he should have addressed it earlier. By not doing so, he might have led her to believe he was okay with her body when he wasn't. That could be seen as dishonest or not being open.\n\nThen, when she asked directly, he answered honestly but maybe not in a way that's supportive. He could have acknowledged her feelings and explained his preferences in a way that doesn't make her feel inadequate. Instead, he told her he prefers bigger, which might make her feel like her body isn't good enough. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the way he communicated it could be harmful.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was already insecure about her body and had been trying on lingerie without it fitting makes the situation more sensitive. He didn't address her insecurities constructively but instead reinforced them by not offering reassurance. That could be why she felt hurt and like he lied\u2014he didn't correct the assumption that he was okay with her body when he wasn't.\n\nOn the other hand, he did tell the truth. Maybe he thought honesty was the best approach here. But in relationships, how you communicate the truth matters a lot. If he could have expressed his preferences in a way that doesn't undermine her self-esteem, maybe that would have been better. But as it stands, he didn't consider the impact of his words on her feelings, especially since she had already shared her insecurities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though he was honest, not addressing the issue earlier and not handling the conversation with care might make him the asshole here. He should have been more proactive in discussing his preferences and supporting her feelings instead of just stating his preference without context or reassurance.\n"
