We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been dating almost 3 years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is different from his usual preferences. She asked him about his feelings on her chest size, and he told her honestly that he's not into her chest size and prefers bigger. She felt hurt, thinking he lied because he never mentioned it before. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether honesty in this context is justified. On one hand, honesty is important in a relationship. On the other, communication is key. The girlfriend had insecurities and approached the topic, so maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But he did tell her the truth when she asked. However, the way he delivered it might have been harsh. He didn't frame it in a supportive way. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have validated her feelings first, then shared his thoughts. \n\nAlso, the fact that he never mentioned this before might have led her to think she met his standards. Now, bringing it up after 3 years could feel like a betrayal. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and lied to. The author might have been honest, but the timing and delivery might have been inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, preferences can exist, but how they're communicated matters. Being honest is good, but without consideration for the partner's feelings, it can cause harm. So, while he's not entirely wrong for being honest, the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because his communication could have been more empathetic and supportive, considering her insecurities.\n"
