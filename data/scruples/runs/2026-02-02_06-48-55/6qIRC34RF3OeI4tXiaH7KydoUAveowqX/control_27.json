We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been together for three years and just recently admitted this preference.\n\nFirst, honesty in a relationship is important. The author says they're being honest, which is good. But timing and how it's communicated matter. They didn't bring this up before, which might have made the girlfriend feel like they were hiding something. She was insecure about her chest size and had been trying on lingerie, which probably made her more vulnerable when she asked about it. The author's response might have come off as blunt or hurtful in that moment.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend felt lied to because the issue wasn't discussed earlier. Even if the author is truthful, not addressing it when the issue was already on her mind could be seen as insensitive. The fact that he prefers a different body type isn't inherently wrong, but how it's communicated affects the relationship. The key points are honesty versus timing and emotional impact. The author might not be in the wrong for being honest, but they could have handled it better to consider her feelings. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact and timing of their honesty.\n"
