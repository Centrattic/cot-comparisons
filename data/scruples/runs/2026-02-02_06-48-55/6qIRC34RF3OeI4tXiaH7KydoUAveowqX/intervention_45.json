We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been in a 3-year relationship, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The issue came up when she asked if he was okay with her flat chest, and he admitted he prefers bigger chests. She felt hurt and thinks he lied by not bringing it up before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Honesty is important, but timing and context matter. He waited until after three years to mention a preference that affects his attraction, which could be seen as a problem. His girlfriend had been struggling with insecurity about her body, and bringing up his preference at that moment might have been insensitive, even if he was being honest. \n\nAlso, the way he delivered the information might have hurt her feelings. Instead of validating her insecurities, he focused on his own preferences without acknowledging her feelings first. The fact that he doesn't find her attractive in a specific way could contribute to her insecurity, even if he meant well. \n\nHowever, he didn't outright lie. He didn't say he found her attractive in that area when he didn't. The problem might be more about not addressing it earlier and not being considerate in his delivery. Relationships require open communication, but it's also about how and when you communicate. \n\nSo, while he wasn't dishonest, his approach might have been the issue. He should have addressed his feelings earlier and perhaps in a more supportive manner. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
