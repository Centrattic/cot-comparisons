We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who's been with his girlfriend for three years and admits he's not attracted to her flat chest, preferring bigger ones. He told her honestly, which hurt her feelings. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Being honest is important, but the timing and the way you communicate can matter. He mentions that she was already insecure about her chest, and she noticed he never commented on it. Then he brings it up out of the blue during a Netflix night. Maybe he didn't consider how that would affect her. \n\nAlso, the fact that he mentioned he prefers facing her away during intercourse because of her chest size might have been a trigger. She felt like he lied because he didn't mention this before. In long-term relationships, there's an expectation of mutual honesty, but there's also a need to approach sensitive topics with care. \n\nHe made an ALT account because family follows his main, so maybe he's anxious about judgment. But the core issue is about respecting her feelings. Even if his preference is genuine, how he communicated it might have been hurtful. Maybe he could have approached it differently, showing more empathy. \n\nSome might argue that he's not wrong for being honest, but others would say he should have considered her feelings more. The key points are honesty vs. sensitivity, and whether he had the right to bring this up in that context. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because even if his feelings are valid, the way he handled it hurt her. Relationships require both honesty and care, and he might not have balanced them well.\n"
