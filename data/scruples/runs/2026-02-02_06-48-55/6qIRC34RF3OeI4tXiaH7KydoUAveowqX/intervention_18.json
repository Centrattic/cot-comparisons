We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being unattracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with. He's used to being with people who have bigger chests. She asked him about her chest size after trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests and that it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on either. She felt hurt because he didn't mention this before, and she felt lied to.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Communication is key in relationships. He didn't bring up his preferences earlier, even though she had insecurities. By bringing it up now, maybe he should have addressed it before to avoid hurting her. But he was being honest. On the other hand, he didn't consider how his honesty might affect her self-esteem. He also mentioned preferring bigger chests, which might contribute to her feeling inadequate. \n\nAlso, the fact that he faces away from her during intercourse because of her chest size suggests that his preferences are affecting their intimacy. But he didn't communicate this earlier. Maybe he should have talked about it sooner to address her insecurities before they escalated. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but timing and approach matter. He could have approached the situation with more empathy. Instead of just stating his preference, he might have validated her feelings first. The fact that she felt lied to indicates that there was an expectation of openness, which he didn't meet. \n\nSo, even though he's being honest, not addressing her insecurities earlier and not handling the conversation with care might make him at fault. The answer could be A. He's in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier and didn't consider her feelings adequately.\n"
