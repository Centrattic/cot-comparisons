We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The author admits he prefers bigger chests and has been avoiding facing her during sex because of this. His girlfriend got hurt and feels lied to because he never mentioned it before.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author didn't bring up his preferences until she brought it up. But when she asked, he was honest but maybe not in a way that considered her feelings. He didn't realize the impact of his words. His girlfriend was insecure and trying on lingerie, which shows she's already self-conscious. Telling her he's not attracted to her chest size could have been more hurtful than helpful.\n\nAlso, the fact that he preferred bigger chests and adjusted their intimacy without discussing it might show a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if he's honest, how he communicates it matters. He could have approached the conversation differently, maybe emphasizing other aspects of her attractiveness and reassuring her instead of just stating his preference.\n\nOn the other hand, being honest about attraction is important too. But the way he delivered it, especially without prior discussion, might have been abrupt. The author might not be in the wrong for not being attracted to her, but he's definitely at fault for not handling the conversation more sensitively. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling like you're being lied to or not appreciated can be damaging. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings in a way that respects her emotions and builds up to the conversation properly.\n"
