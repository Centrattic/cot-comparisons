We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted about not being attracted to their girlfriend's chest is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been dating for almost three years. The girlfriend is thin, petite, and has a flat chest. The user has been with bigger women before and prefers bigger chests. The girlfriend asked if he's okay with her flat chest, and he told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt and thought he lied. Now he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nHmm, the key points here are honesty versus sensitivity. The user was honest but maybe didn't consider how his words would affect her. The girlfriend had been insecure about her body and had tried on lingerie that didn't fit, leading to a mental funk. When she asked, she was probably hoping for reassurance. Instead, he told her he's not attracted to her chest size, which might have been a blow to her self-esteem.\n\nBut then again, he was being honest. Maybe he should have framed it differently. Like, he could have said he loves her regardless but still mentioned his preference in a way that doesn't make her feel bad. But the way he said it directly might have been too blunt. Also, he mentioned that he prefers facing away during intercourse because of her chest size, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention it before. So maybe he should have addressed this earlier rather than letting it fester. The fact that he didn't bring it up before and then just blurted it out when she asked might have made her feel like he wasn't truthful. But he also didn't lie; he just hadn't discussed it before. \n\nSo, the question is about whether honesty is more important than the potential hurt it causes. In relationships, communication is key, but it's also about how you communicate. If he hadn't brought it up before, maybe he should have had that conversation in a more supportive way. Also, considering her insecurities, he might have needed to handle it more gently. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not obligated to pretend to be attracted to her in a certain way. But relationships do require mutual respect and consideration. If his preference is affecting their intimacy, he needs to address it without making her feel inadequate. Maybe there's a middle ground where he can express his preferences without hurting her feelings. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the user being in the wrong because his honesty, while valid, was delivered without considering her feelings. He could have been more empathetic and found a way to express his preference without making her feel unattractive. The fact that he didn't address this earlier and then brought it up in a way that hurt her suggests he could have handled it better. So, answer A.\n"
