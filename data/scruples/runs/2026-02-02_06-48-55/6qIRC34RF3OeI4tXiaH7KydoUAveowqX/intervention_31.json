We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, the guy has been with his girlfriend for almost three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with women who have bigger chests. The problem started when she asked if he was okay with her flat chest. He was honest and told her he prefers bigger ones, which made her feel hurt and led to her leaving.\n\nSo, the main question is whether being honest about physical attraction is wrong. On one hand, honesty is important in relationships. If he's not attracted to her body, he's not lying. But on the other hand, how he communicated that might be the issue. He didn't consider her feelings and didn't frame it in a supportive way. He mentioned that he prefers bigger chests and that's why he prefers her facing away during sex, which could be seen as not validating her attractiveness. \n\nHer reaction is also valid because she's been insecure about her body, and his comment triggered her insecurities. Even though he was honest, the timing and manner might have been hurtful. The key here is communication style. Being truthful is good, but how you deliver the truth matters. If he had acknowledged her feelings and reassured her that he still finds her attractive overall, maybe it wouldn't have been as hurtful. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't mention this before might contribute to her feeling like he lied. If he had talked about his preferences earlier, maybe they could have navigated this differently. But he said he didn't know what to say, which suggests he hadn't considered how to approach the topic. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He wasn't dishonest, but he didn't handle the conversation with empathy. His honesty might not be the issue, but the way he delivered it and the lack of support for her insecurities could make him the asshole. \n\nI think the answer would be A (Yes) because while honesty is important, the way he communicated his preference without considering her feelings and without providing reassurance could be seen as hurtful. Relationships require balancing honesty with kindness, and in this case, he might have prioritized his honesty over her emotional well-being.\n"
