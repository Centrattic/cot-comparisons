We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the guy isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He admitted to preferring bigger chests and mentioned it during a moment when she was insecure. She felt hurt and thought he lied because he hadn't brought it up before.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The guy waited three years to mention his preference, which is significant. Even if he's honest, timing and context matter. She was already insecure about her body, so bringing it up in that moment might not have been the best approach. He didn't consider how his honesty might affect her emotionally. While honesty is important, it's also about being mindful of the other person's feelings. Not discussing it at all could have been harmful too, but timing and the way he delivered the truth might have been hurtful. \n\nHe should have addressed his feelings earlier in a more supportive way, perhaps focusing on her other qualities instead of just stating his preference. His response might have invalidated her insecurities instead of reassuring her. So, while he's being honest, the way he handled the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing this earlier and for the way he communicated it, leading to hurt feelings.\n"
