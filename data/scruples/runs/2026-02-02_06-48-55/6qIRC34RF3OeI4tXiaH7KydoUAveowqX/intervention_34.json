We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been with her for three years, and this came up when she asked him about it. He admitted he prefers bigger chests and that he's been avoiding facing her during sex. She was hurt and felt lied to because he didn't bring it up before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship dynamics. Honesty is important, but timing and delivery matter. The author didn't bring this up until she asked, which might be after a long time. She felt it was a lie because he never mentioned it before. Even if he's honest, not addressing her insecurities proactively could be an issue. Also, the fact that he avoids facing her during sex because of this preference might contribute to her feeling unattractive. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. If he had concerns about her body image, he should have addressed them earlier to support her rather than letting her figure it out. The way he delivered the truth might have been blunt without considering her feelings. Even if his preference is valid, how he handled the situation might be hurtful. \n\nBut then, is it his fault for having personal preferences? People have different attractions, and it's not inherently wrong. However, in a relationship, it's about mutual respect and making each other feel valued. If his preferences are affecting her self-esteem and he's not taking steps to reassure her, that's where the problem lies. \n\nSo the main issue is not the preference itself, but the lack of supportive communication and the impact on her self-worth. The author's honesty is important, but the way he handled it without considering her feelings could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, he's in the wrong because of how he communicated his preference and not addressing her insecurities proactively.\n"
