We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend have been together for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with women who have bigger chests. She asked him about his feelings regarding her chest size because she's insecure. He told her the truth that he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Communication is essential in relationships. The author didn't mention that he was being honest, but he just said what he thought. However, the timing and the way he delivered it might be an issue. She had already brought up her insecurities, and instead of reassuring her, he confirmed her fears. \n\nBut wait, honesty is also important. If he's not attracted to her body type, maybe he should have communicated that earlier. However, in a three-year relationship, maybe there's something else. Does not being attracted to her body mean he's in the wrong? Or is it about how he handled the situation?\n\nShe texted him later saying he hurt her, and he didn't know what to say. He was honest, but maybe he could have been more empathetic. The fact that she felt lied to because he never brought it up before suggests that he might have kept his feelings to himself, which could have been a mistake. \n\nAlso, the impact of his words: She's already insecure, and his honesty might have exacerbated her insecurities. Even if he's being truthful, the way he communicates it matters. Relationships require balancing honesty with kindness. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong for being honest but hurting her feelings? Or is she expecting him to lie about his preferences? The question is whether honesty is an excuse. In some perspectives, if you're in a relationship, you should address such issues earlier. Not bringing it up for three years and then dropping it when she's already vulnerable might be the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's not attracted to her body, maybe it's a deeper issue that they need to work on together. But the way he handled it might have been abrupt. \n\nI think the main issue here is the timing and the context. He waited until she was already feeling insecure to tell her the truth. Maybe he could have approached it differently, with more empathy and reassurance that he still finds her attractive in other ways. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the communication well, even if his honesty is valid. The way he delivered the truth hurt her, and he didn't consider her feelings in the moment.\n"
