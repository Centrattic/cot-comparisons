      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pushing his girlfriend off him during a game. The situation is that when the Eagles tied the game, she jumped on him and kissed him a lot, and he told her to get off and gave her a stiff arm. Then there was a fight because she thought he was being an asshole, especially when he was happy Dallas won.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's watching a sports game with his girlfriend. She's a fan of the Eagles, he's a Dallas fan. The game was close. She gets excited and jumps on him, maybe in a playful way. He responds by telling her to get off and uses a gentle push. Then she's upset for 10 minutes and calls him an asshole, especially when he's happy Dallas won. He tried to explain that his reaction is similar to how she gets emotional while watching Grey's Anatomy, but she still thinks he's wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did he have a right to push her off? If she was being overly affectionate during a game, maybe he felt it was a bad time. But pushing her off, even gently, could be seen as dismissive or hurtful. Also, the fact that he's happy Dallas won might have made her feel like he's being insensitive to her team's efforts. \n\nFrom his perspective, he might think he's just setting boundaries, similar to how she might react to something else. However, the key here might be the communication. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe instead of pushing her off, he could have explained that he wanted to focus on the game or needed a break from the affection. But he did use a \"stern yet gentle\" push, which might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, considering the aftermath: She was upset for 10 minutes and called him an asshole. That's a strong reaction, but maybe she felt disrespected. If he was trying to explain his behavior by comparing it to her Grey's Anatomy reactions, but she didn't accept that, perhaps there's a communication breakdown. He might not have considered how his actions affected her emotionally.\n\nIn relationships, actions that seem minor can have bigger impacts. Even if he felt it was an overreaction, pushing her off during a moment of affection could be seen as invalidating her feelings. She might have felt that he was being cold or dismissive, especially during a time when she was expressing excitement. His happiness at Dallas winning could have been perceived as him being against her team, adding to her frustration.\n\nSo, weighing all that, even if he thought he was just setting a boundary, the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate. The author's action of physically pushing her off, even gently, could be seen as in the wrong because it might have hurt her feelings and didn't account for her emotional expression. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
