      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pushing his girlfriend off during a game. The situation is that during a close game, she jumps on him and kisses him when the Eagles tie it up, and he tells her to get off. Then she gets mad when Dallas wins and he's happy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The girlfriend initiated physical contact, but the author asked her to stop. If she was being overly affectionate or aggressive, maybe it's his right to set a boundary. However, using a \"stern yet gentle stiff arm\" could be seen as a bit harsh if she was just being playful. But the key point is that he was respecting his own space, which is important in any relationship. \n\nThen there's the aftermath. She called him an asshole and got even more angry when Dallas won. His attempt to explain his own emotional reactions (like getting angry/excited during sports) might not have been effective because she was already upset. The problem here could be communication. He might have not expressed his feelings clearly, leading to her feeling disrespected.\n\nThe user is AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the community often looks at intentions and respect. If he pushed her off without any prior warning or if he was being dismissive, that's a problem. But if he clearly communicated that he didn't want her affection at that moment, then maybe she overreacted. However, the fact that she was trying to celebrate her team's moment and he was dismissive could be seen as not respecting her feelings.\n\nAnother angle: emotional reactions during sports can be intense. If she was excited and he was in a different emotional state, maybe they didn't consider each other's feelings. But the main issue is whether his action of pushing her away was justified. If she was being affectionate in a way that made him uncomfortable, then he's not in the wrong. However, if her affection was appropriate and he overreacted, then he might be. \n\nThe key is whether the physical contact was consensual and if he had the right to push her away. If she was being physical without his consent, then he's within his rights. If she was just being playful and he was being cold, then maybe he's in the wrong. The description says she \"jumped on him and went for a flurry of kisses.\" That sounds like a sudden, enthusiastic action. If he felt overwhelmed, pushing her off could be a reaction to being overwhelmed, not necessarily disrespectful. \n\nBut the fact that she was celebrating her team's moment and he was dismissive might have hurt her feelings. The author might not have considered her emotional needs in that moment. So, even if he had the right to set boundaries, his reaction led to a bigger conflict. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate and respect each other's boundaries and emotions. If he had explained his feelings before pushing her away, maybe the outcome would have been different. However, the immediate action of pushing her off might have been necessary for his comfort. \n\nOverall, I think there's a balance here. The author tried to set a boundary, which is okay, but the way he did it and the subsequent conflict suggest that communication was lacking. However, the girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole and getting angry over the team's outcome might indicate that she took it more personally. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how both handled the situation.\n"
