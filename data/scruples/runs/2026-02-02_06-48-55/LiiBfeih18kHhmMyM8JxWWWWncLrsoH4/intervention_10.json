      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who jumped on him during a sports game, started kissing him, and he pushed her off. Now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy is a Dallas fan, the girlfriend is an Eagles fan. The Eagles tied the game, so she gets excited and jumps on him for kisses. He responds by telling her to get off and gently pushes her. Then she's mad for 10 minutes, calls him an asshole, and gets angrier when Dallas wins. He tried to explain that her emotional reactions to Grey's Anatomy are similar to his sports excitement, but she still thinks he's wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether pushing her off was wrong. Let's break it down. When a partner is physically affectionate during an emotional moment, the other person's response can vary. If someone is in the middle of a passionate moment, pushing them away might be seen as rejecting their affection, even if it's not meant that way. \n\nThe guy says he gave a \"stern yet gentle stiff arm.\" That sounds like a polite but firm way to remove her. But maybe the problem is the context. She was excited and showing affection, and he didn't reciprocate at that moment. Even if he's not a fan of her team, her excitement is a positive emotion. Rejecting her physical affection during that could feel hurtful, especially if it's unexpected. \n\nHe compared it to her emotional reactions to Grey's Anatomy. That might not be a good analogy because Grey's Anatomy is fictional, and sports are real-time events with actual stakes. Also, the way emotions are expressed can differ between people. She might have expected a more enthusiastic response from him during her excitement, even if her team is his rival. \n\nAnother angle: communication. After pushing her off, he waited 10 minutes, and she called him an asshole. Maybe he should have talked to her immediately after, explained his feelings instead of just pushing her away. If he was uncomfortable with the sudden physical affection, he could have said so without being dismissive. \n\nThe fact that he was happy Dallas won might have made her feel like he was mocking her, especially if her team had just tied the game. His reaction to Dallas winning might have been the last straw for her, making her feel like he wasn't supportive of her, even during a moment of shared excitement. \n\nIn relationships, respect and consideration are important. Even if a person is being affectionate in a way the other isn't comfortable with, the response should be respectful. A gentle push might be okay if it's mutual and both parties understand the boundaries. But if the person is trying to express affection and the other person rejects it, that can lead to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively. He could have found a way to address his discomfort without making her feel dismissed. The key is whether his action was respectful and communicative. If he just pushed her off without explaining, maybe that's where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But some might argue that it's okay to set personal boundaries, so maybe B. But given the emotional context and the aftermath, the answer is likely A.\n"
