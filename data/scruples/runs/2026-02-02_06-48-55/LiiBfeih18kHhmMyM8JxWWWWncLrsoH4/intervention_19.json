      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pushing their girlfriend off when she jumped on them during a sports game. The girlfriend is an Eagles fan, the author is a Dallas fan. So during the game, when the Eagles tied it up, she jumped on him for kisses. He told her to get off with a gentle push. Then she got angry, called him an asshole, and was upset when he was happy Dallas won. He tried to compare it to her emotional reactions during Grey's Anatomy, but she still thought he was wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to figure out if he was in the wrong. The key points here are consent and communication. When someone jumps on you unexpectedly, especially during a passionate moment like a sports game, it might be overwhelming. The author's reaction was to push her off, which he says was gentle. But the girlfriend felt hurt and angry. \n\nSo, from a consent perspective, if she was physically affectionate without considering his comfort, that could be an issue. But maybe the author should have communicated his feelings beforehand about physical affection during games. If he hadn't mentioned it, then maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, his response of pushing her off might have been abrupt, leading to her feeling rejected. \n\nAlso, the fact that she called him an asshole and got angrier when he was happy Dallas won suggests that her reaction was more about the loss than his actions. But he might not have handled the situation well. Maybe a better approach would have been to ask her to stop in a kinder way instead of pushing her. \n\nOn the other hand, if she was being affectionate and he didn't like it, he has the right to set boundaries. But the way he did it might have been hurtful. The comparison to Grey's Anatomy shows he tried to explain, but she didn't accept it. \n\nI think the author's mistake was not communicating his discomfort beforehand. If he had told her he wasn't into physical affection during games, she might have respected that. Instead, he pushed her off during the moment, which could have been seen as rejecting her affection, leading to her anger. So, he might be at fault for not setting boundaries earlier. But if he felt overwhelmed in the moment and acted to remove himself, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that she was upset about the loss and he was happy Dallas won might have compounded the issue. The author's action, though a reaction to her affection, might have been unnecessary. Maybe a better approach is to acknowledge her excitement while expressing his need for space. \n\nOverall, I think the author is partially at fault for not setting clear boundaries earlier, but not entirely. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that pushing her off could be seen as dismissive, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
