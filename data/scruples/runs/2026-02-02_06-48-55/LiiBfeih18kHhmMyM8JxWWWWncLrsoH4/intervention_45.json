      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who's a fan of the Eagles and the author supports Dallas. During a game, when the Eagles tie the game, the girlfriend jumps on him for kisses, and he pushes her off. She gets mad, calls him an asshole, and the argument escalates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal space. When she jumped on him for kisses, he might have felt uncomfortable. But the question is whether he had the right to push her off. On one hand, he has the right to his body and can set boundaries. But on the other hand, she might have been acting on excitement and affection, which he didn't reciprocate at that moment.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. If she initiated physical contact and he didn't want it, he has the right to say no. However, the way he reacted\u2014sternly pushing her\u2014might have been abrupt or hurtful. Also, after that, he was happy Dallas won, which upset her further. It seems like there's a lack of understanding on both sides. The author is comparing her emotional reactions to his own, but maybe that's not a fair comparison.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her affection was rejected, and the author might feel that his personal space was invaded. But pushing someone off, even gently, could be seen as dismissive, especially if she was trying to show support. The fact that she got angry suggests that she felt hurt or rejected. The author's explanation about his own emotions during sports might not fully address her feelings in that moment.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had a previous discussion about boundaries regarding physical contact during games, maybe it's different. But since he just pushed her off without prior discussion, it could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be entirely wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he was uncomfortable and set a boundary, that's his right. But if the way he set that boundary was hurtful, then he might share some responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings and reacted in a way that could be seen as rejecting her affection without a clear prior discussion. Alternatively, if he had the right to set his boundaries, it might be B. But given the outcome and the girlfriend's reaction, it's possible he's at fault for not handling the situation more sensitively. Hmm.\n"
