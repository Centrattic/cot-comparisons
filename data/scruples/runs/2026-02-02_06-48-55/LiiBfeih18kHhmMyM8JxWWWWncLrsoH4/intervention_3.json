      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pushing his girlfriend off him during a game. The situation is that they were watching a big game, and when the Eagles tied it up, the girlfriend jumped on him to kiss him. He told her to get off and gave her a gentle push. Then she got angry when Dallas won, and he tried to explain by comparing her emotional reactions to his.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's response was \"Yo get off me\" and a gentle push. That seems like he's setting a boundary because he didn't want to be grabbed unexpectedly. But maybe he could have handled it better. Like, instead of pushing, maybe he could have communicated more clearly or asked her to stop in a softer way.\n\nThen, after the game, she's upset and calls him an asshole. He was happy Dallas won, which she might have taken as him not caring about her team. But he tried to explain that her emotional reactions are similar to his when he's into sports. However, maybe his comparison isn't valid because they're different types of emotions\u2014she's expressing affection, while he might be expressing competitiveness. \n\nHe might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings when pushing her off. Even if he was uncomfortable, the way he reacted could have been more respectful. Also, after the fact, instead of just defending his actions, he should have apologized or acknowledged her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if he was genuinely uncomfortable with her sudden physical affection, maybe it's his right to set boundaries. But the way he handled it could be seen as dismissive. The key is whether he was respectful in setting that boundary. A stern \"get off me\" and a push might come off as harsh, especially if she was trying to show affection. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with enough empathy. He should have communicated his discomfort more politely and maybe checked in with her afterward instead of justifying his actions.\n"
