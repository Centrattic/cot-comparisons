I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (24F) is in the wrong for using an app to talk to guys and earn money when she was single, but now her boyfriend (43M) is angry about it even after she quit a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was a broke college student, dependent on her parents, and used the app for financial reasons. She didn't have emotional connections or engage in anything sexual. She confessed to her boyfriend when things got serious and even gave him money as a gesture. However, he keeps calling her a whore and being abusive, even threatening to break up. He has his own issues, like past divorces, family problems, and substance abuse.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she might have breached his trust when they were in a relationship. If they were already a couple when she confessed, then maybe she should have been honest from the start. But if she was using the app before they were in a serious relationship and stopped after starting the relationship, maybe it's less of an issue. The problem is that he's holding it against her a year later and being emotionally abusive, which is definitely a red flag.\n\nBut according to the situation, she stopped using the app after confessing and has been off it for a year. His continued anger and name-calling are toxic and inappropriate. The fact that he's being controlling about her having male friends and making degrading comments about sex workers might indicate deeper issues with trust and control in the relationship. She's also facing pressure from her family about the age gap, which complicates things.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, using the app when she needed money and had no emotional ties might not be unethical. The real problem here is the boyfriend's reaction and ongoing abusive behavior. He's not respecting her past actions once she stopped and is using it to control her. The author's actions might have been a mistake in not being upfront from the beginning, but the boyfriend's response is more about power and control. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if they were already in a committed relationship when she started using the app, then she might be in the wrong for not being transparent. But if she was using it before the relationship became serious and stopped after starting the relationship, then maybe she's not at fault. However, the key issue is the boyfriend's ongoing abuse and inability to move past her past actions, which is a sign of a toxic relationship. \n\nI think the main takeaway is that while the author may have made a choice that the boyfriend disapproved of, the boyfriend's behavior is the real problem. However, depending on when she started using the app in relation to the relationship, there could be some responsibility on her part for not being honest earlier. But given the information, she did confess and stopped using the app, so the boyfriend's continued anger is more of a red flag.\n"
