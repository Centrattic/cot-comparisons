I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old female who used to make money by talking to guys via an app. She mentions there was no emotional connection, no sexting, and the worst was maybe promising snuggles. She quit the app a year before this situation. Her boyfriend is 43 years old, a bit older than her, and he's been calling her a \"whore\" since she told him about the app. He's been through two divorces, has a family with mental health and addiction issues, and has some financial problems. The author is a broke college student dependent on her parents, and her family wouldn't support someone with a significant age gap. She feels pressured to be the financial support in the relationship and is dealing with a lot of anxiety.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author did something for money before the relationship, which she disclosed. The boyfriend reacted poorly, calling her names and being controlling. The author feels she's not in the wrong because there was no emotional involvement, and the boyfriend is acting out of bitterness towards women, given his past. Also, he's not consistent in his behavior, allowing himself certain actions (like saying he can sleep with anyone) that he doesn't extend to her.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. She used the app for money, which is a personal choice. There's no mention of anything illegal or unethical. The app itself is probably a platform where users pay for conversation, which is different from sex work. She stopped using it, so the action is in the past. The boyfriend's reaction is what's problematic here. He's using derogatory terms (\"whore\") and being abusive. That's emotional abuse, regardless of the context. His controlling behavior about her having male friends is also a red flag.\n\nThe boyfriend's history with his ex-wives and his bitterness towards women adds context to his reaction. He might have a history of projecting his past experiences onto women in his life. His family's mental health issues could contribute to his stress, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. The author is in a dependent financial situation, which might make her feel trapped or unable to leave the relationship, adding to the power imbalance.\n\nThe author gave him $1000 as an apology, but he's still holding it against her. This suggests that his anger isn't about the app itself but perhaps deeper issues, like his own insecurities or past traumas. The fact that her previous boyfriend didn't react this way supports the idea that it's more about him than the action itself.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because she disclosed her past actions, stopped the behavior, and there was no emotional connection involved. The boyfriend is being abusive and controlling. The author's financial dependency and the pressure from her family add to the complexity, but they don't make her actions wrong. The key issue here is the boyfriend's response, which is inappropriate and harmful. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
