I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman made money by talking to guys on an app before she was in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She quit the app a year ago, but her boyfriend is still upset and calls her a whore. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what the actual issue is. The woman used the app for financial reasons, not for any sexual activity. She mentioned there was no emotional connection or sexting, just light conversation. But when she told her boyfriend, he reacted angrily, even after she apologized and gave him money. He keeps bringing it up and using that to belittle her.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she was honest about her actions and tried to make amends. She stopped the app, so maybe she's not doing anything wrong now. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014calling her a whore and holding a past action against her even after she's moved on. That could indicate a problem with his behavior rather than hers.\n\nBut then, maybe there's an issue with trust or boundaries in the relationship. Did she have an obligation to not use the app before the relationship? If they were already dating when she confessed, maybe she should have been upfront earlier. However, she did confess and then quit, so she's not hiding it now. \n\nHer boyfriend's history of bitterness towards women and his controlling behavior (like not allowing male friends) might also be a red flag. His reaction could stem from his own insecurities or past traumas, not necessarily her actions. The fact that he's been through two divorces and has a family with various issues might affect his mental state, but that doesn't justify his treatment of her.\n\nShe's financially dependent on her parents and stressed about her future, which might explain why she used the app in the first place. The boyfriend has his own financial issues and family problems. It feels like both are dealing with their own stress, but the way he's handling the situation is more concerning. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the woman's actions (using the app) don't seem inherently unethical, especially since she didn't engage in anything inappropriate. The boyfriend's constant belittlement and inability to move past her past actions seem like the bigger issue here. He's using the term \"whore\" which is degrading and not okay regardless of the situation. \n\nSo, considering all of this, the author might not be in the wrong. The main problems lie with the boyfriend's toxic behavior and inability to trust her. The woman did what she felt was necessary for financial support and was honest when she could be. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of his own issues rather than her wrongdoing.\n"
