I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to men for money before being in a relationship with her 43-year-old boyfriend. She quit the app after confessing to him, but he keeps calling her names and threatening to break up even after a year. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was a broke college student, financially dependent on her parents, and used the app for money. She had no emotional connection or sexual activity with the men. The boyfriend has a troubled background, including a recent divorce and family issues. He has issues with women, calls them derogatory names, and has trust issues.\n\nThe key points here are: she was honest with him, stopped the app when she felt guilty, and gave him money as a gesture of apology. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and ongoing, even after a year. His behavior includes name-calling, threats, and a lack of trust, which might indicate deeper issues rather than her actions alone. \n\nBut the question is whether she was in the wrong. She didn't hide it for long and stopped when she felt it was right. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own issues and inability to move past the incident. However, using money from such an app could be seen as ethically questionable, but the article mentions she didn't engage in anything sexual or emotional. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's persistent anger and threats might suggest he's in the wrong, but the original question is about the author. If she was transparent and stopped the activity, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But some might argue that even if the activity wasn't illegal, it's a breach of trust in a relationship. However, since they were not in a relationship when she did it, that's a factor.\n\nAlso, his reaction seems disproportionate and controlling, which is a red flag. But the initial act of using the app for money without emotional ties might not be her fault. She had financial stress and was young. The boyfriend's response is more about his own controlling behavior rather than her actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. She took responsibility, stopped the activity, and was honest. The boyfriend's continued anger and threats are more problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But some might still think she should have considered his feelings more. But given the circumstances, she was upfront and took steps to apologize. The boyfriend's behavior is more to blame.\n"
