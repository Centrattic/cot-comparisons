  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money before being in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. Now, after a year of quitting the app, her boyfriend continues to call her a whore and hold it against her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a broke college student and used the app for financial reasons. There's no emotional connection or sexual activity involved, just light conversation. She quit the app when she started the relationship, which shows she tried to address the issue when it became relevant. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women, given his past divorces and his family's issues. His reaction seems extreme, especially since he calls her names repeatedly and threatens to break up even after a year. His own actions, like holding onto past grievances and making degrading comments about sex workers, might contribute to the toxic dynamic. \n\nThe author's intentions were financial necessity, not deceit. She did confess and even gave money as an apology. However, the boyfriend's inability to move past this and his controlling behavior (not allowing male friends, threatening to break up) suggest deeper issues in the relationship. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She used the app before the relationship, which could be seen as a past decision that she addressed when she entered the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own issues rather than her actions. However, some might argue that she should have been more transparent from the start or that the act of being paid for online conversations, even non-sexual, could be seen as ethically questionable in the context of a relationship. \n\nConsidering all factors, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic. The author's actions were a past decision she addressed upon forming a relationship. The ongoing conflict is more about the boyfriend's inability to let go and his toxic attitudes towards women. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
