I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 24-year-old woman used an app to talk to guys for money before her relationship with a 43-year-old man started. Now, her boyfriend is constantly calling her a whore for it, even a year after she stopped using the app.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was a broke college student, so she needed money. She used the app for financial reasons, not for sex, and had no emotional connections. The boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women due to his past divorces and has some controlling tendencies. He's also dealing with family issues, which adds stress. When she confessed about the app, he reacted angrily and keeps bringing it up, calling her names and threatening to break up. She gave him money as an apology, but it hasn't helped.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether she's in the wrong. The app work wasn't sexual or emotional, so it's more about selling her time and conversation. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since she stopped using the app a year ago and there's no current behavior causing the issue. His anger might stem from his own issues with women, and he's projecting his bitterness onto her. Also, he's been controlling (e.g., not allowing male friends) and has a history of being in counseling for being bitter, which suggests he has personal problems contributing to his reaction. The author's actions were in the past and weren't harmful, so holding it against her a year later is unreasonable. The boyfriend isn't being supportive, especially with her financial struggles and her ending the app use. The key here is that the author isn't wrong for needing to make money and that the boyfriend's reaction is the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
