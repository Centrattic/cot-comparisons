I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used to earn money through an app by talking to guys, and her 43-year-old boyfriend is upset about it even a year after she quit. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The woman was using the app for financial reasons since she's a broke college student and dependent on her parents. She didn't have emotional connections with the guys and didn't engage in anything sexual or explicit. She quit the app when she felt guilty, especially after starting the relationship. \n\nHer boyfriend, who is older and has a history of two marriages ending in divorce, reacts negatively by calling her a whore repeatedly. He has trust issues, given his past experiences with ex-wives, and has a negative view of women in general. He also has a difficult family situation with a sister with schizophrenia, a brother with addiction issues, and a Xanax-addicted mother. The woman is supportive of him despite these challenges.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, transparency, and mutual respect. The woman was honest with her boyfriend about her past, which she did before they became serious. However, his reaction is extreme and ongoing, even after she quit the app. His behavior includes name-calling and threats of breaking up, which is emotionally abusive. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic. He's projecting his own issues onto her, and his reaction is not proportional to her actions. He calls her derogatory names and holds past actions against her, which is not healthy in a relationship. The woman made a choice she later felt was wrong and took steps to apologize, including giving him money. Yet, he continues to hold a grudge.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the woman's actions were to support herself financially and were not harmful. However, the context of the relationship is crucial. While she was honest and stopped the behavior when it caused issues, the boyfriend's response is toxic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both parties have responsibilities. The woman did what she thought was necessary given her financial situation. The boyfriend's inability to move past her past actions and his controlling behavior (like not allowing male friends) are more significant issues. His past experiences might influence his reactions, but that doesn't justify his treatment of her.\n\nSo, considering all this, the woman isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the real problem here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
