I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (24F) is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves her using an app to talk to guys for money, which she stopped doing, but her boyfriend (43M) is still upset and calls her names.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman was a broke college student when she started the app, using it purely for financial reasons. She didn't have emotional connections, no sexting, just light conversation. The boyfriend found out, took it badly, started calling her a whore, and has been holding it against her for a year. He has a history of two divorces, bitterness towards women, and issues with his family. The woman feels she's being unfair treated, especially since she stopped the app and gave him money as an apology.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but wants a second opinion. Let's analyze from different angles:\n\n1. **Consent and Honesty**: The woman was honest about her actions, which is important. She confessed, so there's no deception. However, using an app to message people for money might be seen as a form of transactional relationship, which some might view as exploitative or ethically questionable, even if she's not doing anything explicit. But in her case, she's doing it for financial reasons as a student, which adds context.\n\n2. **Boundaries in the Relationship**: The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He has his own issues with women (bitterness from past relationships) and control issues (not wanting her to have male friends). His behavior\u2014calling her names, threatening to break up, and not letting go of the issue\u2014suggests a lack of emotional control and possibly jealousy or insecurity. The fact that he criticizes sex workers while she's doing something similar (even if not sexual) shows inconsistency.\n\n3. **Power Dynamics and Control**: The boyfriend's financial instability and family problems might contribute to his need for control. However, his constant belittling and threats are unhealthy. The woman's financial dependence on her parents might have made her feel cornered, leading her to take the job. His reaction exacerbates her anxiety rather than supporting her.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: The app itself. If it's a legitimate app where she's providing a service (like companionship) for payment, and she's not engaging in anything illegal or unethical, then she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's perspective is that it's degrading, which is his personal opinion but not a legal or moral issue.\n\n5. **Communication and Resolution**: She stopped the app and tried to apologize, even giving money. He hasn't moved past it, indicating he might not be ready for a healthy relationship. Her guilt after confessing suggests she didn't want to hurt him, but his reaction is part of the problem.\n\nPutting this all together, the author's actions (using the app) might be ethically questionable to some, but they were done out of necessity and without deception. The boyfriend's response is more problematic due to his controlling behavior, lack of trust, and inability to move past the issue. His history and attitude towards women are red flags. So the primary issue is his reaction, not her initial action. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
