  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (24F) is in the wrong in her situation. The main points are:\n\n1. She used an app to talk to guys for money before she was in a relationship. She quit when she started dating her 43M boyfriend.\n2. The boyfriend calls her a \"whore\" constantly after she confessed. He has a history of bitterness towards women, including degrading comments about strippers and not allowing her to have male friends.\n3. He has a troubled family and financial issues. She's a broke college student dependent on her parents.\n4. She gave him $1000 in an apology, but he's still angry and threatens to break up. He's been unfaithful in the past, but now he's double standards.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the act itself\u2014using an app to talk to guys for money\u2014might be seen as ethically neutral if it's non-sexual and consensual. The key factors here are that she had no emotional connection, didn't engage in sexual activities beyond light conversation, and used it for financial reasons. Her boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially considering his own history with women and his current behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's anger and double standards are problematic. He's projecting his past experiences onto her and holding this against her for a year after she quit. His behavior (calling her names, threats, controlling her friendships) is abusive regardless of her past actions. His own issues, like his family problems and financial instability, don't excuse his treatment of her.\n\nThe author feels guilty but maintains that her actions were justified given her financial situation. She tried to apologize and make amends, but he's not letting go. The fact that he accuses her of being a \"whore\" while being unfaithful (as implied by his past relationships) shows hypocrisy.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions were a personal choice for financial support, and she quit when the relationship started. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own insecurities and control issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for her past actions, especially since they were non-emotional and she stopped when she started the relationship.\n"
