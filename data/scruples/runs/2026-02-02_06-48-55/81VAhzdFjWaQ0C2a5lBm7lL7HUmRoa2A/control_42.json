I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in her situation. So, the key here is to assess both sides of the relationship and see whose actions are more problematic.\n\nFirst, the author (24F) was using an app to talk to guys for money before she started dating her boyfriend. She clarifies that there was no emotional connection, no sexting, and the worst part was maybe promising snuggles. She stopped using the app after the relationship started and has been off it for a year. However, her boyfriend (43M) is constantly calling her a whore and bringing it up after she confessed. He also has a history of negative views towards women, degrading comments about sex workers, and controlling behavior regarding her male friends. \n\nNow, looking at the boyfriend's behavior: he calls her names, threatens to break up, and is very controlling. He also has a history of bitterness towards women from his past divorces, which might contribute to his current attitude. His family situation is complicated, but that doesn't excuse his toxic behavior. The author has been financially supporting him as well, but he's in debt and has a problematic family. \n\nThe author's defense is that she stopped using the app once the relationship became serious, showed remorse by giving him $1000, and feels he's being overly harsh. She also mentions her financial dependence on her parents and the pressure she's under. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the act of using the app before the relationship and stopping it was wrong. Since she didn't have emotional connections and it was for financial reasons, many might see her actions as understandable, especially given her student status and need for money. However, the boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. His constant belittlement, threats, and controlling behavior are signs of emotional abuse. The fact that he calls her derogatory names and brings up the issue repeatedly after a year is toxic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic and harmful. The author's actions, while perhaps not ideal in the context of a relationship, were for survival and she stopped once the relationship became serious. The boyfriend's lack of forgiveness and toxic mindset make him the one at fault here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
