I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money before her relationship with a 43-year-old man. She quit the app a year after confessing to him, but he still calls her a whore and is angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was using the app before the relationship, so that's a key point. The boyfriend's reaction is intense and ongoing, which is problematic. He also has issues with trust and bitterness towards women, which he brings up, like his past divorces and negative views towards sex workers. He also restricts her from having male friends, which is a red flag for controlling behavior.\n\nThe author didn't have emotional connections with the guys on the app and didn't engage in anything that could be considered cheating. She used the app for financial reasons, which is understandable given her being a broke college student. The boyfriend's anger and constant threats of breaking up are more indicative of his own issues, not necessarily her wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of transparency. Even though she quit the app after confessing, the fact that she didn't disclose this before the relationship became serious might be an issue. But given that she was in a relationship before and he had a history of trust issues, maybe she felt she had to be honest when the time came. \n\nHis reaction seems more about his own insecurities and past traumas than her actual actions. The fact that he calls her names and threatens to leave, despite her not doing anything that would be considered cheating, points to his controlling and abusive tendencies. The fact that he compares her to his ex-wives and targets sex workers with his derogatory language also shows a pattern of judgment and misogyny.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have been upfront from the start about her past. But in her defense, the app use was before the relationship, and she did eventually tell him. His inability to move past that and his toxic behavior are more significant issues.\n\nSo weighing all these factors, the author's actions aren't inherently wrong, especially since she quit the app and had no emotional ties. The main problem lies with the boyfriend's reaction and his controlling behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she isn't in the wrong.\n"
