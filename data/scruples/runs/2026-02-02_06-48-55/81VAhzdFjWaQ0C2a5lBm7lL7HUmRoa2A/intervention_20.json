I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using an app to talk to guys for money while in a relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author is 24, a college student, and financially dependent. Before the relationship, they used an app to earn money by talking to guys. The key points are that there was no emotional connection, no sexting, and the worst was promising snuggles. The boyfriend found out and has been calling her a whore for over a year, even though she quit the app. He has issues from past relationships and family problems.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, from a moral or relationship standpoint, what's the line here? The author was in a relationship when she did this. Even though she stopped using the app before the relationship became serious, the fact that she didn't disclose this to her boyfriend could be an issue. Relationships often require transparency, especially about things that might make the other person uncomfortable.\n\nBut on the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Calling her a whore repeatedly and not moving past it, even after a year, is abusive. His behavior is toxic, and he has his own issues with women, which he projects onto her. The author's financial dependence adds pressure, making her situation more complex. She had a valid reason for needing money and did something that's not necessarily harmful by her own description.\n\nThe key here is whether the act itself was wrong. If she was in a relationship at the time, then yes, it's a breach of trust. But the timing matters. If she did it before the relationship, then maybe it's less about being in the wrong. However, she confessed to him, and the way he reacted is problematic. The author's actions might not be the sole source of conflict here. The boyfriend's inability to move past it and his controlling behavior are significant issues.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong, especially if she was doing it out of financial necessity and without emotional ties. But ethically, in a relationship, keeping such things secret could be seen as a breach of trust. However, since she stopped using the app and it's been a year, the continued conflict is more on the boyfriend's part. The author's main issue is his reaction, not her past actions. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
