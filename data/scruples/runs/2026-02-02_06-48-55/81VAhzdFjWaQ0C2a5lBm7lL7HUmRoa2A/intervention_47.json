I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman who was making money through an app by talking to guys without any emotional connection. She quit a year ago, but her boyfriend, who is 43, keeps calling her a whore because she confessed to him. He's been through two divorces and has a lot of family issues, including a schizophrenic sister and a violent brother. He also has financial problems. The author is a broke college student relying on her parents and is financially dependent. She helped him emotionally and financially when they got serious. \n\nHe has a history of bitterness towards women, calling them sluts and whores, and is against her having male friends. After she confessed about the app, he had an angry reaction, and even though she's been off the app for a year, he still brings it up. She gave him $1000 as an apology but he's still upset. She's anxious about financial stability and her family's reaction if they knew about the age gap. She feels he's being unfair compared to her previous boyfriend who was supportive.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether her past actions (using the app for money without emotional involvement) and her current relationship dynamics mean she's at fault. \n\nFirst, the app itself: If she's using it to have non-sexual conversations for money and there's no emotional connection, maybe it's a form of work, like a gig economy job. But some might see it as transactional and possibly controversial, especially if there's a risk of being misinterpreted. However, she didn't engage in anything sexual or emotional, so from her perspective, it's just work. The fact that she quit after feeling guilty suggests she was concerned about his feelings.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction is harsh\u2014he calls her a whore constantly, which is abusive. His history of bitterness towards women and his controlling behavior (disapproving of male friends) are red flags. The fact that he's bringing up this past issue even after a year, despite her having left the app and apologized, points to possible jealousy or possessiveness, maybe even emotional manipulation. His threats to break up and his own behavior (like the heroin OD, financial instability, and family issues) might indicate he's not handling his own issues well, projecting onto her.\n\nShe's in a financially vulnerable position, dependent on her parents and him, which could be a power imbalance. His threats to break up might be a way to control her. The money she gave him as an apology might have been an attempt to appease, but he's still not letting it go. Comparing to her previous boyfriend who supported her financially shows she's in a toxic dynamic with this current partner.\n\nThe question is if she's in the wrong. On one hand, she did something that her boyfriend found hurtful. On the other, she was in a situation where she needed money and didn't engage in anything she felt was wrong. He's the one with the controlling and abusive behavior. The fact that he's holding this against her for a year and not allowing her to move past it suggests that the problem is more about his inability to trust and his toxic views on women rather than her actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, even if there's some ambiguity about the app work, the boyfriend's behavior is more clearly problematic. The author is in a difficult position, dealing with his emotional issues and financial dependencies. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here; the responsibility lies with the boyfriend for his toxic reactions and lack of trust.\n"
