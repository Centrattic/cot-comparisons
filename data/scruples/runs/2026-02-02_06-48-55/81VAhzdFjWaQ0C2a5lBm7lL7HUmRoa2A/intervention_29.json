I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 24-year-old woman was using an app to talk to guys for money, without any emotional connection, and her boyfriend, who is 43, is constantly calling her a whore for it. She quit the app a year ago but he still holds it against her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author was using the app before the relationship, and she stopped when she felt guilty. She didn't have sexual interactions or emotional attachments. The boyfriend has a history of being bitter towards women, which might influence his reaction. \n\nOn one hand, using the app for money could be seen as a personal choice. If there's no emotional involvement and it's not illegal or harmful, some might argue it's not wrong. However, since she's in a relationship now, honesty is important. She did confess, which is good, but the boyfriend's reaction is extreme and abusive.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014calling her names, threatening to break up, and not moving past it\u2014is problematic. His personal issues, like his family problems and past, don't justify his actions. The fact that he's being controlling and degrading is a red flag in the relationship.\n\nThe author's intentions were for financial support, which is understandable, especially as a student. However, in a relationship, mutual respect and communication are key. Even if her actions aren't wrong, the boyfriend's response is toxic. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong for using the app (especially since she stopped and was honest), the boyfriend's reaction is definitely wrong. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since there's no legal or moral violation (assuming the app isn't illegal), she's not the one at fault here. The issue lies with the boyfriend's abusive behavior. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
