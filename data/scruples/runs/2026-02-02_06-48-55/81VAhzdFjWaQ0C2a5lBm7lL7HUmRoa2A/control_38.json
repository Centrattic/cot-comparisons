I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the 24-year-old woman was using an app to talk to guys for money, and her 43-year-old boyfriend found out and has been calling her a whore since. They've been in a relationship for a while, and he has a history of bad experiences with women, including his ex-wives. She stopped using the app a year ago but he's still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author was making money through the app, but it's non-sexual. She didn't have emotional connections or sexting. The app work was for financial reasons because she's a broke college student. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has trust issues due to past betrayals. He's been called names and has a controlling attitude, like not allowing her to have male friends. He also has a history of anger and bitterness towards women, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. From her perspective, she was acting out of financial necessity. However, in a relationship, transparency is important. She confessed, which is a good step, but maybe the issue is how he reacted. His reaction seems disproportionate and abusive. He's been calling her names, threatening to break up, and being controlling. That's not healthy. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior doesn't seem to be about the act itself but more about his own insecurities and past trauma. He's using the situation to belittle her and control her, which is toxic. The author's actions might not be the worst, but the boyfriend's response is definitely wrong. The key here is that while she did something that might not be ethical in a relationship without full disclosure, she did stop and was honest. His reaction is more about his own issues than her actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she was upfront and stopped, while the boyfriend is being abusive and controlling.\n"
