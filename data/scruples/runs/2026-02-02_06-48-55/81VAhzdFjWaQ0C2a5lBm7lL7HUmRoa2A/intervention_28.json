I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money, and her 43-year-old boyfriend is upset about it, calling her names and being emotionally abusive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author worked on this app before the relationship, earning money because she's a broke college student relying on parents. She stopped using the app after confessing to her boyfriend. However, he's been calling her a whore and acting out with anger since then. He has a history of issues, including past divorces, a family with mental health and addiction problems, and his own past with drug overdose. The author felt guilty but didn't think she was doing anything wrong since there was no emotional or sexual involvement.\n\nNow, considering the question of wrongdoing. The key points here are consent, honesty, and mutual respect. The author was honest by telling him about the app, albeit after they got serious. But the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and abusive. He's calling her derogatory terms, threatening to break up, and being controlling about her relationships. His behavior is toxic and harmful.\n\nThe author's actions involved making money through a service that others might find controversial, but she didn't engage in anything illegal or explicitly inappropriate. She stopped using the app after confessing, showing effort to address his concerns. However, the boyfriend's response is more about his own control issues and past traumas rather than the act itself. His behavior is more concerning here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for using the app? If she was honest and stopped after the confession, maybe not. The main issue is the boyfriend's emotional abuse and lack of support. The author's financial dependence and anxiety add to the complexity. The boyfriend's threats and insults are unacceptable regardless of the app.\n\nBut some might argue that the app work could be seen as unethical or exploitative, even if it's legal. However, the author's intent was financial support without emotional ties. The boyfriend's reaction is more about control and his own prejudices against sex workers, which he projects onto others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had questionable judgment, the boyfriend's abusive behavior is the more significant issue. The question is about who is in the wrong. The author's actions, though perhaps not ideal, don't reach a level of wrongness that justifies the boyfriend's treatment of her. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
