I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The author is a 24-year-old female in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used to make money by talking to guys on an app, but she didn't have any emotional connections or sexual interactions with them. She told her boyfriend about this, and he's been calling her derogatory names and threatening to break up, even though she quit the app a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend has a history of two divorces, a family with significant mental health and addiction issues, and financial problems. He has anger issues and a tendency to generalize women as being untrustworthy. The author was financially dependent on her parents and used the app to make money while in college. She felt guilty and tried to apologize, even giving him money to show her sincerity.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author didn't engage in any sexual activity or emotional involvement, which might be important. However, the act of monetizing conversations with men, even if non-sexual, could be a red flag for someone with trust issues like her boyfriend. But is that justifiable for him to be so angry and abusive?\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Constantly calling her names, threatening to break up, and not moving past the issue even after a year suggests poor emotional control and possibly jealousy or insecurity. His history with ex-wives and his negative views towards women might contribute to his overreaction. His behavior\u2014labeling her as a \"whore\" and making degrading comments about sex workers\u2014indicates a problematic attitude towards women, which is not healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe author's actions, while perhaps not ideal, don't seem to cross into deceit or harm. She was honest when she confessed, and the boyfriend's response has been abusive. The fact that he uses this as a reason for ongoing conflict, even after she's quit the app, points to his inability to handle the situation maturely.\n\nFinancial dependency and family pressures also play a role. The author is in a vulnerable position, and her boyfriend's threats might be a form of emotional manipulation. Given all this, the onus is on the boyfriend to manage his own issues rather than blaming her for past actions that no longer occur.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's not respecting her by continuing to bring up a past decision she's already addressed. His anger and insults are controlling and unhealthy. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
