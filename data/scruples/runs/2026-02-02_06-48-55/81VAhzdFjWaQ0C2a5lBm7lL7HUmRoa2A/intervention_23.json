  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman dating a 43-year-old man. She used to earn money by talking to guys on an app without any emotional connection, and after confiding in her boyfriend, he's been calling her a whore and being abusive. She's a college student dependent on her parents, and the boyfriend has a complicated family situation with mental health and addiction issues.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The woman started using the app before the relationship, so maybe she didn't expect it to be a problem. She stopped using the app a year ago when she entered the relationship, which shows she made a conscious decision to quit. The boyfriend, however, has a history of bitterness towards women due to his divorces and family issues. He's been using derogatory language and threatening to break up. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. She was honest about her past actions once she was in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly abusive, especially with the constant name-calling and threatening behavior. The fact that he calls her a whore repeatedly and doesn't let it go after a year is a red flag for emotional abuse. \n\nShe also gave him $1000 as an apology, which might have been an attempt to make things right, but his behavior hasn't improved. His past issues with his ex-wives and his negative views towards women (like calling strippers derogatory names) suggest his reaction isn't just about her actions but his own issues. \n\nThe woman's financial dependence on her parents and her anxiety about the future add context to her initial decision to use the app. However, that doesn't make her actions right, but it does show a motivation driven by necessity. \n\nOn the other hand, she should have been upfront about using the app from the start, especially since relationships often require transparency. But she did stop once she was in a serious relationship, indicating she wanted to avoid causing harm. The boyfriend's ongoing anger and refusal to move past this after a year is problematic. His behavior is more indicative of control and jealousy, maybe projecting his own faults onto her.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the boyfriend's actions are more concerning. He's being verbally abusive and holding her past against her, which is unhealthy. While the woman might not be entirely blameless for not disclosing earlier, the primary issue is the boyfriend's toxic behavior. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's behavior is more harmful and unjustified.\n"
