I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a 24-year-old female in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used to make money through an app by talking to guys non-sexually, and she confessed to her boyfriend. Now he's been calling her a whore and holding it against her even after a year since she quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman was doing this for financial reasons, which is understandable given her being a broke college student. She didn't have emotional connections and didn't engage in anything inappropriate beyond light conversation. She felt guilty enough to apologize and even gave him money to show she was serious. It's been a year, but the boyfriend continues to bring it up, which seems excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction is very harsh. He calls her a whore constantly, which is emotionally abusive. His history with previous relationships and his bitterness toward women might contribute to his overreaction. He has his own issues, like family problems and financial debt, which could affect his behavior. The fact that he doesn't think she should have male friends and makes degrading comments about women suggests a problematic attitude, possibly due to his past experiences.\n\nThe woman's actions were done before the relationship, and she was transparent about it. Even though there's an age difference and his controlling behavior, the key point is whether her past actions were wrong in the context of their relationship. Since she didn't have emotional connections and the work was light, it's more about financial need than anything else. His ongoing anger and threats to break up seem to stem from his own issues rather than her actual wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering that she was honest, had no emotional ties, and the work wasn't harmful, the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own insecurities and past. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue lies with the boyfriend's behavior being toxic and controlling.\n"
