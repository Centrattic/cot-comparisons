  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money when she was in college and broke. She's now in a relationship with a 43-year-old man who's been through two divorces and has a complicated family. When she confessed about the app, he called her a whore and it's been a year since she quit, but he's still angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a financially unstable situation, relying on her parents. The app work was non-sexual, just casual chats for money. She didn't have emotional connections and stopped when the relationship got serious. She even gave him $1000 as an apology.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has trust issues from his past, a troubled family, and seems to have a lot of bitterness towards women. He calls her names and is controlling, not allowing male friends. His reactions are extreme and ongoing, even a year later. He also makes degrading comments about sex workers and women in general, which might contribute to his harsh judgment.\n\nThe key points are: the app work was non-sexual, for financial reasons, and the author stopped when the relationship became serious. The boyfriend's response is disproportionate and ongoing, creating a toxic environment. The author tried to make amends but he's not moving past it. His controlling behavior and inability to trust her are problematic.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she made a choice to earn money in a non-exploitative way, stopped when the relationship progressed, and communicated her actions. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues and lack of trust, not her actions per se. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
