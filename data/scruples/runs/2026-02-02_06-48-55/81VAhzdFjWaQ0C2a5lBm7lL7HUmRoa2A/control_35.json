I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in her situation. She's a 24-year-old woman in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used to make money through an app by talking to guys without any sexual involvement, but her boyfriend calls her a whore for it and still holds it against her a year later.\n\nFirst, the key points here: She was in a vulnerable position financially, relying on her parents. The app work was non-sexual, just casual conversations for money. She quit the app when the relationship got serious and apologized, even giving him $1000. However, her boyfriend has ongoing anger, calls her names, and is emotionally abusive. He has a history of bitterness towards women, degrading comments about sex workers, and controlling behavior (e.g., not allowing male friends). Plus, he's had a troubled family background and has his own issues with debt and a past heroin overdose.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the elements of betrayal and the nature of their relationship. The author was honest about her past when she joined the relationship and stopped the app work when it became serious. She didn't hide it, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly rooted in his own issues rather than the act itself. The work wasn't sexual or emotionally involved, so labeling her a \"whore\" seems inappropriate and more about his personal biases.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior crosses into emotional abuse with constant threats, name-calling, and controlling tendencies. The dynamic here is toxic. The author's actions were a means to an end due to financial instability, and she took steps to address the issue by apologizing and quitting the app. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not holding himself to the same standard; he claims he can \"fuck anybody\" without consequences, which is hypocritical and manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and trust are crucial. The boyfriend's inability to move past this and his ongoing anger without valid reason point to his own problems, not the author's. The fact that her family might not support her if they knew about the age gap adds pressure, but it doesn't justify his behavior. The author isn't in the wrong here because her actions were a response to financial hardship, she was honest, and she ceased the activity when it became a problem. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues and toxic behavior rather than any legitimate wrong by the author.\n"
