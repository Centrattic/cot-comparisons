I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is a 24-year-old female in a relationship with a 43-year-old man who's been through two divorces. She used to make money by talking to guys on an app, but she had no emotional connections and didn't engage in anything sexual. She quit after a few months but her boyfriend, upon finding out, called her a whore and hasn't let go of it even after a year. The guy has a lot of personal issues, including a problematic family, financial debt, and a history of drug overdose.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong. She used the app for financial reasons, which is understandable given her situation as a broke college student. She was clear about not having emotional connections or engaging in anything sexual. The boyfriend, however, has a history of bitterness towards women due to his ex-wives, and he has controlling tendencies, especially regarding her interactions with other men. He also has a history of mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't hide her actions initially but confessed, which shows some level of honesty. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and potentially rooted in his own issues rather than the actual action. His behavior\u2014calling her names, threatening to break up, and being controlling\u2014suggests that his reaction is more about his personal insecurities and past traumas than the ethical wrongness of her actions.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's actions don't inherently make her wrong unless there was a prior agreement about exclusivity or sharing of finances. Since she was using the app before the relationship, and he only found out after they were serious, his reaction might be more about his inability to handle her independence or his own controlling tendencies. Additionally, his justification for calling her names is questionable given his own history with substance abuse and family issues.\n\nThe author's decision to quit the app was made to respect his feelings, so her intent wasn't malicious. The fact that he continues to bring it up after a year, despite her having stopped, indicates that his anger is more about his own unresolved issues rather than her current actions. His controlling behavior and the power imbalance in the relationship (he being older, with more life experience, and her being financially dependent on her parents) also play a role in how this dynamic is perceived.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while perhaps naive or driven by financial necessity, don't constitute her being in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of his personal issues and lack of emotional control than any wrongdoing on her part.\n"
