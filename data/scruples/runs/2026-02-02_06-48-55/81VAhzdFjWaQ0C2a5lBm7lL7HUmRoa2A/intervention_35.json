I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. Before they started dating, she used an app where she talked to guys for money. She mentions it wasn't emotional, no sexting, just light conversation. She did it for financial reasons because she's a broke college student dependent on her parents. She quit the app after she started the relationship but her boyfriend keeps bringing it up, calling her a whore, and threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the app work. The author isn't engaging in anything sexual or emotional, just talking for money. She did it before the relationship, which is important. Many people have jobs they do before a relationship that a partner might disapprove of, so maybe that's a factor. However, the boyfriend's reaction is extreme\u2014he's been calling her a whore constantly for over a year after she quit. That seems like a red flag. His behavior is abusive, with constant threats and emotional manipulation. \n\nThe boyfriend has his own issues: recent divorce, a sister with schizophrenia, a brother with a restraining order, and a Xanax-addicted mother. He's also mentioned his ex-wives cheated and he has bitterness towards women. He doesn't allow her to have male friends, which could indicate jealousy or controlling behavior. The author is in a financially vulnerable position, dependent on her parents and the boyfriend's family, which might be contributing to her feeling trapped.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's actions were pre-relationship, non-sexual, and for financial necessity. The boyfriend is acting abusively by constantly belittling her and threatening the relationship. Even though she apologized and tried to make amends by giving him $1000, he hasn't let go of the issue. His behavior seems more about his own insecurities and past traumas, but that doesn't justify his treatment of her. The author isn't engaging in the same behavior anymore, so his ongoing anger is unwarranted.\n\nIn relationships, communication and respect are essential. The boyfriend's inability to move past this and his toxic reactions suggest that the problem lies more with him. The author's intent was innocent, and she stopped the behavior when she realized it was causing issues. His constant criticism and threats are emotionally abusive, which is a serious issue. \n\nFinancial dependence can also make it harder for someone to leave a toxic relationship, which is a factor here. The author might feel pressured to stay in the relationship despite the negative treatment because of her financial situation. However, that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the main problem here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for using the app before the relationship, especially since she stopped it when she started dating him. The boyfriend's ongoing anger and abusive behavior are the real issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
