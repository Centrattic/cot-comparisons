I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman was using an app where she talked to guys for money but had no emotional connections. Her 43-year-old boyfriend found out and has been calling her a whore for a year after she quit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she was a broke college student, dependent on her parents, and used the app for money. She had no emotional feelings, no sexting, just light conversation. She felt guilty and quit, even gave him $1000 as an apology. She's been trying to support her family and deal with his family's issues.\n\nThe boyfriend's side: He's been through two divorces, has trust issues, a stressful family situation with a sister with schizophrenia and a brother with addiction. He has a history of bitterness towards women, calls them sluts and whores, and doesn't allow her to have male friends. He's been abusive in past relationships. He took the app confession as a personal betrayal, even though she had no romantic feelings involved.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, she was honest about her actions, stopped the behavior, and tried to make amends. She didn't have romantic intentions. On the other hand, his reaction seems extreme and possibly toxic. He's projecting his past traumas onto her, and his behavior (calling her names, threatening to break up, controlling her friendships) is problematic.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and trust. The author didn't act with malice; her actions were for financial reasons and were non-romantic. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues, and he's not treating her with respect. His controlling behavior is a red flag. Even though he's been through a lot, that doesn't justify his actions towards her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her actions, stopped them, and tried to address his feelings. The boyfriend is the one displaying toxic behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
