I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys non-sexually for money. She had no emotional connections and quit after a year. Her 43-year-old boyfriend, who's in a new relationship, calls her a whore after she confessed. He has a lot of trust issues due to his past divorces and family problems, including a brother with a restraining order against him. The author is financially dependent on her parents and felt she needed the money. She gave him $1000 in apology but the conflict continues even a year later.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Did the author do something wrong? The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. The app work was non-sexual, and she didn't have feelings for those guys. But the boyfriend's jealousy and constant name-calling are problematic. Also, his history of bitterness towards women and controlling behavior (like not allowing male friends) are red flags. The author is in a financially vulnerable position, which might have forced her to take the job. The boyfriend's reaction could be more about his own issues than the actual action. The author has moved on from the app, so the issue is ongoing due to his inability to let go. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior, like threatening to break up and making degrading comments, is more concerning. He also has a history of drug use and family drama. The author's actions, while maybe not ideal, don't seem malicious. She was trying to support herself. The boyfriend's jealousy and lack of trust could be signs of deeper issues, maybe even emotional abuse. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the app work wasn't illegal, didn't involve emotional harm, and she was honest about it after quitting, then his reaction is more about his own problems. The author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that working in such an app could be seen as morally wrong, even if it's not. However, the boyfriend's constant belittling is definitely wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's actions were a personal choice to support herself, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own insecurities and past. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
