I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was using an app to talk to guys and make money before she started dating her boyfriend. She's 24, he's 43. Now he's been calling her a whore constantly since she told him about the app. The main question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. She was using the app for money, not for emotional connections. She wasn't doing anything sexual or sexting, just light conversation. She stopped using the app after starting the relationship. The boyfriend has a lot of issues: he's going through a divorce, has a family with problems (schizophrenic sister, violent brother, addicted mother), and financial debt. He also has bitterness towards women, as mentioned by his comments about ex-wives and not allowing her to have male friends. \n\nWhen she confessed about the app, he had an explosive reaction, calling her names and not letting go of it even after a year. She felt guilty but justified because she wasn't emotionally involved. She even gave him $1000 as a gesture of apology. Now they argue about it frequently.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is important, so she did tell him. The problem is how he's reacting. But the app itself might be a gray area. If the app is a form of sex work or anything that would be considered unethical, maybe, but she's saying it's just conversation. However, the fact that she was making money from these interactions could be a point of contention, especially if he views it as prostitution. \n\nBut the key here is whether she was in the wrong. If there was no emotional attachment and no explicit agreements beyond conversation, maybe she wasn't. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of transparency and mutual respect. If she was engaging in something that he would find objectionable, even if it's not illegal, there's a conflict. \n\nAlso, his behavior is problematic. He's calling her a whore, threatening to break up, and showing anger. His past with ex-wives and bitterness towards women might influence his reaction. He might have double standards, as he's okay with his own actions but not hers. \n\nThe author's main point is that she didn't have feelings and stopped when she started dating him. She's financially dependent and had her reasons. But if the app was something he found morally wrong, even if she didn't, then the issue is his reaction, not necessarily her actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she wasn't being deceptive and stopped when the relationship started. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues and double standards. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
