I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's analyze this situation. The user is asking whether the author (24F) is in the wrong in her relationship with her 43M boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author used an app to talk to guys non-sexually for money. She had no emotional connection with them and quit a year ago. She confessed this to her boyfriend, who took it very badly, calling her names and not letting it go. The boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women and controlling behavior, like disapproving of her having male friends.\n\nThe author's financial situation is unstable; she's a broke college student relying on her parents. The boyfriend also has financial issues and a troubled family. She gave him $1000 as an apology, but he's still angry. She feels he's being unfair compared to her previous boyfriend. \n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The author's actions: While using the app might be seen as a personal choice, she did lie about it initially, which can be a problem in a relationship. However, the context matters. She was in a vulnerable financial position, and the work was non-sexual. Stopping the app shows she took responsibility.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is extreme. His constant belittlement, calling her a whore, and controlling behavior indicate toxic traits. His inability to move past her confession, despite her having quit and apologized, shows a lack of maturity and trust. His behavior is more concerning here. He also has a history of bitterness towards women, which is unhealthy. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were wrong. While lying about it is an issue, the work itself wasn't inherently unethical. The boyfriend's response is more indicative of a toxic mindset and inability to handle the situation respectfully. The author is not in a healthy relationship dynamic, but her initial use of the app isn't necessarily \"wrong\"\u2014it's more about the boyfriend's toxic behavior being the real problem.\n"
