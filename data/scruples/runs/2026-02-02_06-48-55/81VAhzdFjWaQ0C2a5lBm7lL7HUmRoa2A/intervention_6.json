  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author is a 24-year-old female who used an app to talk to guys for money before she was in a relationship with her current 43-year-old boyfriend. She had no emotional connections and didn't engage in anything sexual. She quit the app when she started the relationship. However, after confessing to the boyfriend, he's been calling her a whore and being abusive in the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He's been calling her names, threatening to break up, and his behavior includes controlling tendencies (like not allowing female friends). Also, he has a history of bitterness towards women, stemming from his past marriages and family issues. The author is financially dependent and felt pressured to use the app, but she stopped once the relationship started.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author made a decision she felt was necessary for financial reasons. She was honest with the boyfriend, even when it led to conflict. The boyfriend's reaction is not just disapproval but involves emotional abuse, which is a red flag. His behavior may be more about his own issues (like past trauma, family problems) and his unwillingness to accept her past actions, even after she's left the app.\n\nThe boyfriend's control over the situation, his threats, and his inability to move past this issue suggest that his behavior is more problematic. The author's use of the app, while perhaps ethically ambiguous in some contexts, was non-sexual and temporary, and she stopped once the relationship began. The key issue here is the boyfriend's abusive behavior and lack of trust, which is more harmful than her past actions.\n\nSo, while the author might have made a choice that some could view as inappropriate (depending on cultural or personal values), the primary responsibility for the conflict lies with the boyfriend's reaction. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
