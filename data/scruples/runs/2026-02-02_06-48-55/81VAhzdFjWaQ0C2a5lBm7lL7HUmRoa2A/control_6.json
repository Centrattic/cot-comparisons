I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was making money through an app by talking to guys, non-sexually, and she didn't have any emotional connections. Then she told her boyfriend, who is 43, and he's been calling her a whore and holding it against her for a year.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was a broke college student, dependent on her parents for financial support. She used the app before the relationship, and she stopped a year ago. The boyfriend has his own issues\u2014divorced twice, has a sister with schizophrenia, a violent brother, and a Xanax-addicted mom. He also has student debt and a history of heroin OD. \n\nHe seems to have a lot of bitterness towards women, given his past and his comments. She mentioned he calls strippers derogatory names and is against her having male friends. That sounds like control issues. When she confessed, he had a rage reaction, calling her a whore repeatedly. She apologized and gave him money, but he hasn't let it go. He also threatens to break up and says he can \"fuck anyone he wants,\" which is pretty controlling.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was her action something that the boyfriend has the right to be upset about? She didn't do anything illegal or necessarily unethical by his standards, but she's in a relationship now. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly a reflection of his own issues, like jealousy, control, and maybe his past experiences with women. \n\nThe app work wasn't sexual, so she wasn't engaging in anything that would typically be considered cheating or exploitative. The boyfriend's constant belittlement and threats might indicate a toxic relationship. Also, his comments about her not being able to have male friends and his own double standard (he can do whatever he wants) suggest a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally and ethically, if she wasn't doing anything wrong, and the boyfriend is reacting with anger and abuse, then she might not be in the wrong. However, in a relationship, transparency is important. She did tell him, which is a positive step. His reaction is the problem here, not necessarily her action. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues and control, not her actions being inherently wrong."
