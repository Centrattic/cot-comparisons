I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman was using an app to talk to guys and earn money without any emotional connection. Her boyfriend, who's 43, has been calling her a whore since she confessed. He's been holding this against her even after a year. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman was using the app for financial reasons because she's a broke college student dependent on her parents. She's not emotionally involved with anyone on the app and hasn't done anything sexual. The boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women due to past divorces and has issues with his family. He's been in counseling for that bitterness. \n\nSo, the main question is whether she's wrong for using the app. Well, if she's not doing anything illegal and there's no emotional or sexual component, maybe she's not inherently wrong. But the boyfriend is reacting very negatively, calling her names, and threatening to break up. He also has a history of being judgmental about women and sex workers. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly controlling. He doesn't want her to have male friends, which is a red flag. Also, he has trust issues from his past. However, he was aware of her using the app before it was a problem? Or did she confess later? She said she told him when the relationship was getting serious. His explosive anger and constant bringing up the issue a year later suggests he might be emotionally abusive.\n\nThe woman might not be in the wrong for using the app, especially if it was for financial reasons and there's no emotional or sexual connection. However, the key here is the consent and communication between partners. If she was honest about it and he's not respecting her for it, then the issue lies more with him. Also, his double standards\u2014like saying he can do whatever but she can't\u2014point to his behavior being problematic.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the woman's actions might not be wrong if she's being honest and there's no harm done. But the boyfriend's behavior is definitely abusive. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since she had a valid reason (financial need), no sexual or emotional involvement, and was honest, she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
