I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in her situation. The scenario involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money and is now dealing with her 43-year-old boyfriend's anger and constant name-calling after she confessed. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was using an app to make money because she's a broke college student. She didn't have any emotional connections and didn't engage in anything sexual or explicit, just light conversation. She quit the app a year ago but her boyfriend is still upset, calling her a \"whore\" repeatedly. He also has a history of a bitter attitude towards women due to his past divorces and family issues.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle here. The author's actions were done for financial necessity and she didn't engage in anything illegal or harmful according to her description. However, she had a relationship with her boyfriend when she was doing this, so there might be an issue of trust and honesty. She did confess to him, but his reaction seems extreme and abusive. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key factors are her intent (financial need, no emotional involvement), the nature of her actions (non-physical, non-sexual), and her boyfriend's response (abusive behavior, lack of trust). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if she was honest about her actions and there was no deceit, then maybe she isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that she should have avoided such a situation in a relationship to prevent hurt feelings, especially considering the power dynamics (age, financial dependency). \n\nBut her boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. His constant belittling and threats are abusive. He's projecting his past issues onto her, which isn't her fault. The fact that he can't move past this even after a year suggests more about his own insecurities and issues rather than her actions. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. She did communicate, yet he's still holding it against her. The author's actions, while perhaps not ideal, were not malicious. His reaction is more indicative of his own problems. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might not be ethically wrong, especially given her financial situation and the fact that she had no malicious intent. The real issue lies in her boyfriend's inability to handle the situation maturely and his abusive behavior.\n"
