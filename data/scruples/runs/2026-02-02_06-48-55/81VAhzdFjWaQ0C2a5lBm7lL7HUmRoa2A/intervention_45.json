I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (24F) is in the wrong in her situation with her boyfriend (43M). The main issue is that she used an app to talk to guys and earn money before she started dating him, and she feels guilty about it, but he keeps calling her a whore and not letting it go.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. She was using the app for money, no emotional connection, no sexting, just light conversation. She quit the app when she got serious with him. But he found out and has been abusive, calling her names and threatening to break up. He has a history of bitterness towards women because of his exes, and he doesn't support her having male friends. She's financially dependent on her parents and felt pressured to use the app for stability.\n\nNow, considering consent and transparency. When they started dating, she didn't tell him about the app initially. But she did confess later, maybe feeling guilty. However, his reaction was extreme and abusive. His behavior seems more problematic\u2014name-calling, threats, controlling behavior about friends. His past with his family and exes might contribute to his controlling nature.\n\nLegally and ethically, if she's not engaging in anything illegal or harmful, maybe she's not in the wrong. But in a relationship, honesty is key. However, she did stop using the app after they got serious, so maybe she tried to be honest when she could. His reaction is what's more concerning here. The fact that he doesn't show any change despite her apology and financial offering suggests he's in the wrong.\n\nShe's under a lot of stress and financial pressure, which might have influenced her initial decision to use the app. But the boyfriend's ongoing abuse is a red flag. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. If the app wasn't something they discussed and she stopped, maybe she's not at fault. His behavior is toxic.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. The main issues are his controlling behavior and inability to move past her past. She's the one trying to make amends, while he's being abusive and holding onto resentment. His actions are more indicative of a toxic relationship.\n"
