I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is a 24-year-old female in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used to make money through an app by talking to guys non-sexually and has no emotional connection with them. The boyfriend calls her a whore constantly after she confessed, even a year after she quit the app.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The app she used\u2014was it something that could be considered unethical or degrading? She mentions it's non-sexual, just light conversation, and she wasn't into any of the guys. So maybe it's a legitimate gig where people pay for companionship or conversation. But the key here is the boyfriend's reaction. He has a history of bitterness towards women due to his ex-wives and struggles with family issues. He also gave her counseling after his first divorce, which suggests he had prior issues with trust or anger towards women. However, after she confessed, he hasn't stopped being angry or using that term. \n\nThe user is in a financially unstable situation, relying on parents and the app for income. The boyfriend has his own financial problems and a challenging family environment. She gave him $1000 as part of her apology, but he's still bringing it up and threatening to break up. That's a red flag for emotional abuse. Even if the app was questionable, his constant belittlement and holding a past action against her is toxic. \n\nThe main question is whether her actions were wrong. If the app wasn't illegal or unethical, and she had no emotional ties, then maybe not. But if the app was perceived as something that could lead to suspicion, especially in a relationship where the partner has trust issues, her being upfront about it is important. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own biases and inability to handle her independence. He's also making controlling statements like not wanting her to have male friends. That's a sign of a controlling partner, not her actions. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), because while she might have made a questionable choice in the context of the relationship, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic. The app work isn't inherently wrong if it's consensual and she's not engaging in anything she's uncomfortable with. His constant name-calling and inability to move past her confession are abusive. The user's intent was to support herself financially in a difficult situation, and his reaction is more about his own issues rather than her wrongdoing.\n"
