I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 24-year-old woman, was using an app to talk to guys and earn money. She didn't have any emotional connections with them, just light conversation. Then she entered a relationship with a 43-year-old man who's been through two divorces and has a complicated family situation. He's been calling her a whore since she confessed about the app, even though she's been off it for a year now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author was making money by chatting, which isn't inherently wrong. She clarifies it's non-sexual and she doesn't have feelings for them. However, she did keep this from her boyfriend for a while before confessing. That secrecy might be an issue. Relationships often require honesty and communication, so not telling him about something that could be a deal-breaker for him might be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Calling her a whore constantly and holding the past against her for a year is abusive and toxic. He's also making degrading comments about other women and sex workers, which shows a negative attitude. His behavior is likely more problematic than hers. But the question is whether she is in the wrong.\n\nShe had financial pressures as a college student and used the app before the relationship. Once she was with him, she felt guilty and confessed, even giving him money as an apology. The fact that he continues to bring it up and treat her poorly suggests that his issues are deeper. However, her initial decision to keep the app a secret until later might still be a point of contention. \n\nBut considering the context, she's in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally, dependent on her family and in a challenging relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning with his anger, threats, and lack of support. His past with ex-wives and family issues might contribute to his possessiveness and jealousy. \n\nSo, while the author did keep information from her partner which could be seen as a lack of full transparency from the start, the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and abusive. The question is whether her actions constitute being in the wrong. If the standard is about honesty and communication, maybe she should have been upfront earlier. But if the standard is about respecting each other's boundaries and not being abusive, then he's clearly in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both parties share responsibility, but the boyfriend's ongoing behavior is more harmful. However, the initial secrecy might still make the author partially at fault. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide if her actions alone make her at fault. Given that she disclosed and stopped the app, and his reaction is toxic, maybe she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
