  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 24-year-old woman, used an app to talk to guys for money before her relationship with her current 43-year-old boyfriend. Now, after she confessed, he's been calling her a whore constantly for a year even though she stopped using the app.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a broke college student, dependent on her parents, and used the app for financial reasons. She didn't have emotional connections or engage in anything sexual. The boyfriend, who is older and has a history of being wronged by ex-wives, has a lot of bitterness towards women and issues with other men being around her. He also has family problems, which add to the stress.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she stopped the app when the relationship got serious and tried to make amends by giving money. She feels guilty but doesn't believe she was a whore. Her boyfriend, however, continues to be angry and threatens to break up, despite her not using the app anymore. He also has his own issues with controlling behavior (like disapproving of male friends) and a history of substance abuse.\n\nNow, the key here is whether her actions were wrong. The app work was non-sexual and for financial survival. She didn't hide it initially and confessed when the relationship became serious. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme and ongoing, which could indicate his own issues with trust or control rather than the act itself. His history of bitterness towards women and controlling behavior might mean he's projecting his own problems onto her.\n\nBut then, was it wrong to not be honest from the start? Wait, she did confess after a few months. Maybe she should have been upfront earlier? But the boyfriend only revealed his divorce after three weeks. Maybe both have issues with communication. Also, she was in a vulnerable financial situation, which complicates things. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his inability to handle jealousy or his own past traumas rather than her actual actions.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions\u2014while perhaps not perfect\u2014might not be in the wrong. The main issues stem from the boyfriend's toxic behavior, his inability to move past his past, and his controlling tendencies. She tried to make amends and stopped the activity. The problem isn't just her actions but how he's responding, which is abusive and disrespectful.\n"
