I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 24-year-old woman made money by talking to guys on an app before she started dating her 43-year-old boyfriend. She didn't have emotional connections or any sexual stuff, just light conversation. The boyfriend calls her a whore constantly after she confessed, even though she's been off the app for a year. He's been through two divorces, his family has issues, and he has trust issues. The woman is financially dependent on her parents and had the app job to help with money. Now, she's feeling guilty but he's still angry and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author used the app for financial reasons, not for sex. The boyfriend reacted extremely negatively, even after a year. He has a history of bitterness towards women, has family problems, and is controlling. The author is in a financially unstable situation and he has financial issues too. The BF's reaction seems excessive and possibly abusive. The author didn't have emotional connections or engage in anything inappropriate beyond light conversation. The main issue is whether her actions were wrong given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering the context, the author's actions might be seen as wrong if the boyfriend had known about the app beforehand and it was a deal-breaker. But since she confessed and quit the app, and the BF's reaction is disproportionate and ongoing, it's more about his control and past issues. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014calling her names, threatening to leave, and having trust issues\u2014seems more problematic. The author's use of the app was for financial support, which is understandable given her situation. The BF's inability to move past this and his controlling behavior might indicate deeper issues in the relationship, possibly abuse or lack of trust. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's more on the BF for his reaction and lack of support, while the author did what she could for financial reasons. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
