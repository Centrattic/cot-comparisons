I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was using an app to talk to guys non-sexually and getting money for it. Then her boyfriend found out and has been calling her a whore for a year, even after she quit the app. The user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA), so we need to assess if her actions were wrong in this context.\n\nFirst, let's look at her actions. She was a broke college student, dependent on her parents. She used an app to make money, which involved talking to guys but no emotional connection or sexting. The worst part was promising snuggles. She didn't do anything illegal, and she wasn't a sex worker. She used the app strictly for financial reasons, which is understandable given her situation.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction. He's a 43-year-old man who's been through two divorces. He has a lot of family issues, including a schizophrenic sister, a violent brother, and a Xanax-addicted mother. He met her a month after separating from his second wife. He's been counseling after his first divorce about not being bitter towards women. However, he calls her a whore constantly, doesn't allow her to have male friends, and has a double standard where he claims he can do whatever he wants. He also has financial issues and a history of drug overdose.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't have an emotional connection and was honest with her boyfriend. She even gave him $1000 as an apology. However, the boyfriend has a history of holding grudges and being judgmental towards women, which is a red flag. His behavior is controlling and abusive.\n\nThe author's actions, while perhaps naive or not considering the partner's potential reaction, don't inherently make her wrong. She was in a vulnerable financial position and made a decision to support herself. The boyfriend's inability to move past this, his constant belittlement, and his controlling behavior are the real issues here. The fact that he threatens to break up and calls her names when she has already quit the app shows that he's not being fair or respectful.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's double standards (he can do whatever he wants) indicate a lack of mutual respect in the relationship. The author is in a toxic situation where her partner is projecting his bitterness towards women onto her. His family's issues add to the stress, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for using the app when she was in a difficult financial situation and being honest about it. The real fault lies with the boyfriend's overreaction, controlling behavior, and lack of respect. The author's intentions were pure, and she took responsibility, so she's not the one in the wrong here.\n"
