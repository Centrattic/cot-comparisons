I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using an app to talk to guys for money and the subsequent fallout with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is 24, in college, and financially dependent on her parents. She used an app where she talked to guys non-sexually for money. She didn't have any emotional connections and stopped a year ago. The boyfriend, who is 43 and went through two divorces, has a negative view of women, calling them sluts and whores. He also has family issues with addiction and mental health problems. \n\nWhen she confessed about the app, he got angry and started calling her a whore repeatedly. She apologized and gave him money, but he still brings it up weekly, threatens to break up, and acts like he can do whatever he wants sexually. She feels he's being hard on her, especially since her previous boyfriend didn't react this way.\n\nNow, to assess if she's in the wrong. She used the app before the relationship, right? Or did she start during? The post says she confessed to him when they were getting serious, so maybe it was during the relationship. If she was in a relationship and using the app, that could be an issue of dishonesty. But she says she stopped after confessing a year ago. Also, she had financial reasons, which adds context.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is problematic. His anger, name-calling, and controlling attitudes (not allowing male friends) are signs of jealousy and possibly abuse. His family's issues might contribute to his stress, but that doesn't excuse his treatment of her. He also has a history of drug OD and high debt, which adds complexity.\n\nThe key points: Did she have a duty to disclose her app usage before the relationship became serious? If she was using it during the relationship, then yes, she might be wrong for not being honest. But she did confess and stopped, so maybe she tried to make amends. However, his reaction is extreme and abusive. The question is about her being in the wrong, not his behavior.\n\nBut the title is asking if she's in the wrong for using the app. The act itself\u2014talking to guys for money without emotional involvement\u2014could be seen as a form of sex work depending on the app, but she says it's non-sexual. If it's just chatting, maybe not. However, in a relationship, if there's an expectation of exclusivity or honesty, then not disclosing could be an issue. But she did confess. The problem is his reaction, not necessarily her past actions. \n\nFinancial dependence and her anxiety might have influenced her decisions. The boyfriend's controlling behavior is a red flag, but the question is about her. If she used the app during the relationship, maybe she should have been more upfront from the start. But if she stopped after confessing and he's still holding it against her, then he's the one continuing the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If she was in the relationship and using the app, then maybe she should have been honest earlier. But given her financial situation and his controlling nature, it's possible she felt it was a necessary means to an end. However, the fact that she used the app during the relationship and didn't disclose it until it became a problem could mean she was wrong for not being upfront. But the boyfriend's reaction is definitely toxic. \n\nHmm. I think the answer leans towards B (No) because her actions don't necessarily make her wrong, especially given the financial context and the fact that she stopped. The boyfriend's behavior is more to blame here. But there's a gray area if she used the app during the relationship without disclosure. However, the story says she confessed when they were getting serious, so maybe she did disclose. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
