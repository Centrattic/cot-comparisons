I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money before she started dating her 43-year-old boyfriend. After confessing, he's been calling her derogatory names and holding it against her, even a year later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a broke college student dependent on her parents. She used the app for financial reasons, not for any emotional connection. She didn't sext or have any physical interactions, just light conversation. She quit the app when the relationship got serious and felt guilty. She gave him $1000 as an apology, showing she took it seriously.\n\nThe boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women due to his past divorces and family issues. He's using derogatory terms like \"sluts\" and \"whores\" towards others, which the author finds problematic. He also has trust issues, not allowing her to have male friends. His behavior seems toxic and controlling, especially considering his threats to break up and his own issues.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's actions were for financial necessity, she had no emotional involvement, she stopped using the app when she entered a serious relationship, and she felt remorseful, even giving money to show her sincerity. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and based on his own unresolved issues and jealousy. His behavior is more harmful to the relationship, showing a lack of trust and respect.\n\nSo, while the author did keep a secret that might have been unwise in hindsight, especially in a relationship, the boyfriend's behavior is more indicative of a toxic dynamic. The severity of his anger and the constant holding it against her for a year suggests that he's the one in the wrong. The author's actions, while not perfect, were driven by financial need and she made the effort to stop and apologize. The boyfriend's ongoing harsh treatment is the bigger issue here.\n"
