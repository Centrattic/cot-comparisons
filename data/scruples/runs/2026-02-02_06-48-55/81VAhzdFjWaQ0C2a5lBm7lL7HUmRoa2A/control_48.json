I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (24F) is in the wrong for making money through an app by talking to guys without any emotional connection, and her boyfriend (43M) is constantly calling her a whore and holding it against her even after a year.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author was a broke college student, using the app before the relationship as a means to make money. She had no emotional involvement, no sexting, just light conversation. She quit the app when she started the relationship and apologized, even giving him money as a gesture. The boyfriend, however, has a history of bitterness towards women due to his past divorces and family issues. He's also dealing with a lot of stress from his family's problems. He's been unfaithful (implied by him saying he can \"fuck anybody\"), yet he's judgmental about her past actions.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and fairness. The woman didn't do anything illegal or involve emotional attachment. She stopped when the relationship started, which shows she cared about his feelings. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has trust issues and seems to project his own behaviors (like his comment about being able to have sex with anyone) onto her. His reaction is disproportionate, especially since it's been a year and he still brings it up. Also, he's in a position where he's almost twice her age, has financial instability, and a problematic family, yet he's the one making degrading comments and threatening to break up if she doesn't conform to his strict expectations.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is controlling and hypocritical. He criticizes her for something she did before they were together and hasn't moved past it, while he himself has a history of being wronged by women but still holds onto that bitterness. His comments about male friends and his own infidelity comments suggest a lack of mutual respect. The woman is also under significant pressure from her family and financial stress, which makes her position more vulnerable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman's actions were within her rights and done out of necessity. The boyfriend's inability to trust, his harsh judgment, and his controlling behavior are the real issues here. The fact that he's still holding a grudge after a year and calls her names repeatedly indicates that the problem lies more with him than with her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
