I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (24F) is in the wrong for making money through an app by talking to guys without any emotional connection, and then the boyfriend (43M) is upset and calling her a whore even after a year since she quit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was a college student, financially dependent on her parents, and used the app for money. She didn't have emotional connections, no sexting, just light conversation. The boyfriend, who is older, recently divorced, and has a troubled family, reacted badly when she told him. He calls her names, is controlling about her friendships, and has a history of bitterness towards women. She gave him money as an apology but he hasn't forgiven her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she was honest about her actions when she confessed, and it's her way of earning money without any sexual or emotional involvement. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels hurt and is projecting his past issues onto her. He's making her feel guilty and is controlling, which might indicate deeper problems in the relationship. \n\nThe key points are the financial dependency, the non-emotional nature of her work, and the boyfriend's controlling behavior. Since she was upfront and there's no indication she did anything unethical or harmful beyond what she disclosed, it's possible she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that engaging in such work could be seen as morally wrong, but the post says she doesn't engage in sex work and just has light conversation. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own issues\u2014his past with ex-wives, his family problems, and his controlling attitudes. He's treating her poorly, which is a bigger issue. So, the author might not be at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
