I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 24-year-old woman used an app to talk to guys and make money. She wasn't emotionally involved and didn't sext, just things like promising snuggles. She quit the app a year ago, but her boyfriend, who's 43 and a bit older, keeps bringing it up and calling her names like \"whore.\" The boyfriend had issues with his ex-wives and has a lot of family problems. She's financially dependent on her parents and the boyfriend, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether she was wrong to use the app. The key points here are the nature of the app. She said it wasn't sexual, no sexting, just light conversation. If that's the case, then maybe it's not inherently wrong. People have different boundaries, but if she was compensated for conversation, it's more of a gig economy thing. However, the boyfriend's reaction is extreme. He's holding it against her for a year, even though she's stopped. That seems like a problem on his end. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering the age difference and power dynamics: she's 24, he's 43. There's a significant age gap, and she's financially dependent on him and her parents. That could create an imbalance where she feels she can't make certain choices freely. His family's issues might add stress, but that doesn't justify his behavior towards her. He also has a history of substance abuse and mental health issues in his family, which could affect his stability.\n\nThe fact that she confessed shows she was trying to be transparent. She gave him money as an apology, which she didn't feel was necessary but did to appease him. His continued anger and threats to break up are controlling and unhealthy. The boyfriend's actions seem more problematic. He's projecting his bitterness towards women (from his past) onto her, which is toxic. \n\nHowever, the app work might be a red flag in the relationship. If the boyfriend felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe it's a boundary issue. But given the context\u2014she was a broke student, he's financially unstable too\u2014she had to make tough choices for money. The boyfriend's inability to move past this and his constant accusations could indicate deeper issues like jealousy or lack of trust, which are issues on his part.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for using the app in a non-sexual way. The mistake was not considering the boyfriend's possible insecurities and how he might react. But the primary fault here seems to be with the boyfriend's behavior, not the author's initial decision. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
