I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money while in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She quit the app a year ago, but her boyfriend still calls her a whore and holds it against her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a broke college student, dependent on her parents, and used the app for financial reasons. She had no emotional connections and didn't engage in anything sexual or explicit. The boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women, partly due to his past divorces and family issues. He's also been unfaithful in the past, but he doesn't think she should have male friends. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the author's action wrong? The boyfriend's reaction is extreme and ongoing, even after a year. The author has apologized and given money to show remorse. The boyfriend's behavior includes constant belittlement, threats, and a lack of trust, which are toxic traits. \n\nThe author's actions, while perhaps not ideal, don't involve deceit beyond what she confessed to. She stopped the behavior once she felt guilty and the relationship was serious. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own issues and inability to trust, compounded by his family problems and past experiences. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even though she used the app before the relationship, she was upfront about it once she felt the time was right. The boyfriend's anger and ongoing attacks are problematic. The author's situation includes financial instability and family pressures, which might explain her need for the app. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes controlling tendencies, like disapproving of male friends and not supporting the author financially. His reaction is disproportionate, given that the author has no feelings for those guys and has moved on. The fact that he calls her names and threatens to break up repeatedly suggests he's not handling the situation healthily. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because she acted out of necessity and was honest. The boyfriend's reaction is more indicative of his own issues, like trust problems and misogyny. However, the author should have considered the potential impact on the relationship before confessing, but once she did, the boyfriend's response is where the real issue lies. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The main responsibility lies with the boyfriend's toxic behavior and inability to handle the situation maturely.\n"
