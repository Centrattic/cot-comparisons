I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that she was using an app to talk to guys for money, no emotional connection, no sexual stuff beyond maybe some promises of snuggles. She told her boyfriend, who's 43, and he's been calling her a whore and holding it against her for a year. He has a history of bitterness towards women, issues with his family, and financial problems. She's 24, a broke college student, financially dependent on her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions were wrong. She used the app for money, not for emotional reasons. There's no mention of anything illegal or unethical beyond selling her time in conversation. Some might argue that it's a form of sex work or not, depending on the app's policies and what exactly was offered. But she says no sexting, no emotional connection. However, the line might be blurry here. If the app is similar to platforms like OnlyFans or others where people monetize their attention, maybe that's acceptable. But if it's something that's more like offering companionship for money, which could be seen as transactional sex, depending on the context.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction. He's been called a whore constantly and holds it against her. He has trust issues due to his past divorces and negative experiences with women. His reaction seems extreme and possibly controlling. He's also making degrading comments about women and sex workers, which shows his own problematic behavior. He also doesn't allow her to have male friends because \"they all want to fuck me,\" which sounds controlling and possessive.\n\nHer reasons for doing it were financial necessity. She's a broke student, so she needed money. She quit after confessing and has been off the app for a year. She tried to make amends by giving him money. But his anger continues, and he's threatening to break up, which is emotionally abusive. His control over her, financial dependency, and the pressure from her family (if they find out about the age gap, they'll stop support) add to a toxic dynamic.\n\nThe key points here: Was her action wrong? If the app is legal and consensual, then maybe not. However, the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and indicative of his own issues. The relationship itself seems abusive with his constant belittling and controlling behavior. She's in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the act itself isn't wrong, then her actions might not be, but the boyfriend's reaction is the real issue. However, if the app is considered sex work (even if not explicitly), some might argue she's in the wrong. But given that she had no emotional connection and it's for money, and considering the boyfriend's own problematic behavior, it's more likely that the boyfriend is the one with issues. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main problem is the boyfriend's reaction and the toxic relationship dynamics.\n"
