I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 24-year-old female college student who used an app to message guys and get paid. She's not had any emotional connections or sexual stuff, just light conversation. She made money this way before meeting her 43-year-old boyfriend. Now, she's been off the app for a year but her boyfriend still calls her a whore and is angry about it. He has a history of two divorces, issues with his family, and some financial problems. He's also judgmental towards sex workers and doesn't trust her having male friends. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if I agree. Let's consider the key points here. \n\nThe author's actions: She used an app to make money through non-sexual conversations. She didn't have emotional connections or engage in explicit content. She quit when she started the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is ongoing anger and name-calling, even after a year. He also has a history of bitterness towards women and control issues.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is important. The author did confess, which is a good step. But maybe the way she approached it or the context matters. However, the main issue here is whether using the app was morally wrong. Since there's no sexual or emotional component, just a transactional arrangement for conversation, it's more about her financial needs. She was in a vulnerable position financially and had to make a choice to support herself. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. His anger stems from his past experiences and prejudices. He calls her derogatory names and holds the past against her, even after she's quit. His behavior shows a lack of trust and possibly control issues. He also has a history of being bitter towards women, which might contribute to his harsh judgment. \n\nThe author's intentions were to make money without any emotional or sexual involvement. She took steps to apologize and even gave money to show her sincerity. The fact that it's been a year and he's still holding it against her suggests that his issue might be more about his own insecurities or past traumas rather than her actions. \n\nFinancial independence is a significant factor here. The author is a college student with no financial support, and her previous boyfriend supported her in making money. The current boyfriend's attitude seems controlling, especially given his financial situation and family issues. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't engaging in illegal or harmful activities. The app work, as described, is more about companionship. The boyfriend's reactions are disproportionate and could be part of a pattern of controlling behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for using an app to make money before the relationship. Her actions were honest and she stopped when the relationship became serious. The ongoing conflict stems more from the boyfriend's inability to move past it and his own issues, not the author's actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
