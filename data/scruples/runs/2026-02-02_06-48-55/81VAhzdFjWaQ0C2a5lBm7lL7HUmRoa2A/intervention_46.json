I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, she's a 24-year-old female in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used an app where she talked to guys for money, but there was no sexual stuff involved, just light conversations. She stopped after a few months in the relationship when she felt guilty. The boyfriend got really upset, called her a whore, and still brings it up a year later. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was a broke college student, financially dependent on her parents. The app was a way to make money, and she didn't have emotional connections. The boyfriend has a history of issues with women (divorces, bitterness), and he's judgmental about others. He also has family problems that add stress. She gave him $1000 as an apology and he still isn't over it.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. Did she do something that breaks trust? Maybe, but she was honest with him. The app isn't illegal or inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the behavior has stopped. His continued anger and derogatory language (\"whore\") might indicate deeper issues in their relationship, like his past traumas or his inability to handle financial stress. \n\nHe also has controlling tendencies, like not wanting her to have male friends. That's a red flag. Her decision to use the app was a way to support herself, which isn't her fault. The boyfriend's reaction and ongoing threats to break up could be more about his own insecurities rather than her actions. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and respect each other. If she was honest and stopped the behavior, maybe he's the one being unreasonable. His actions, like calling her names and threatening to leave, are harmful. Her being in the wrong would depend on if she was deceptive, but she confessed. However, his continued resentment might be his fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the main issue is the boyfriend's inability to move past her confession and his toxic behavior. The author's actions, while perhaps not perfect, were driven by financial need and she was upfront. The real problem lies in his response and control issues. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
