I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 24-year-old woman, was using an app to talk to guys for money before she started dating her 43-year-old boyfriend. She didn't have any emotional connections and stopped using the app after a year into the relationship. The boyfriend keeps calling her a whore and threatening to break up, even though she's been off the app for a while.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author was using the app for financial reasons, which I can understand since she's a broke college student. The key point here is whether the app's use is considered a form of sex work or something else. She mentions that the worst interaction was promising snuggles, but there was no sexting or anything more explicit. If the app is a legitimate way to earn money through conversation without engaging in sexual activities, then maybe it's not inherently wrong. However, the boyfriend's reaction is the main issue here. He's using derogatory terms and being abusive, which is a problem regardless of the situation. \n\nThe boyfriend has his own issues: he's recently divorced, has a history of drug addiction, a problematic family, and mental health challenges in the family. He also doesn't support the author's male friendships, which might indicate jealousy or possessiveness. The fact that he's been in counseling after his first divorce suggests he might have unresolved issues, but that doesn't justify his current behavior. \n\nThe author's motivation was financial necessity, and she felt guilty enough to give him $1000 as an apology. The boyfriend's constant threats and name-calling could be a sign of controlling behavior or emotional abuse. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, but from the information given, the boyfriend's actions seem more problematic. However, the app's nature is a bit unclear. If it's a form of sex work, there might be differing opinions on its morality. But since the author isn't engaging in it anymore and has apologized, the ongoing conflict might stem from the boyfriend's inability to move past it, possibly due to his own biases or trauma.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the author didn't hide this from the start and confessed when the relationship was becoming serious, that shows some level of honesty. But maybe she should have considered how he might react, especially given his history with women and his current attitude. However, the boyfriend's response of anger and degrading language seems excessive and harmful. The fact that he's threatening to break up and making degrading comments about sex workers and women in general might indicate deeper issues in his behavior that could be part of an abusive pattern.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the app. Given that she was doing it for money, without emotional involvement, and stopped after starting the relationship, it's more about the boyfriend's reaction and behavior. The author might not be in the wrong, but the boyfriend's actions are definitely problematic. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's response is inappropriate and potentially abusive, and the author's actions were driven by financial need and she has since stopped.\n"
