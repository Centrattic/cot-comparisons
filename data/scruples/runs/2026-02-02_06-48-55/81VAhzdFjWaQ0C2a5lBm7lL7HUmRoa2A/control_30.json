  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used to make money by talking to guys on an app, and her 43-year-old boyfriend is upset about it. She's a broke college student, financially dependent on her parents, and she's been in a serious relationship with her boyfriend for a while.\n\nFirst, the woman was earning money through the app before the relationship. She didn't have emotional connections with the guys, just light conversations. She quit the app after a year and felt guilty because her boyfriend, who has a history of bad relationships and a negative view of women, reacted angrily. He called her a whore and continues to be upset even after a year.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems problematic. He has a history of bitterness towards women, given his past experiences with ex-wives. He also makes degrading comments about women in certain professions. His reaction to her past actions is harsh, and he's been threatening to break up, which is a sign of emotional manipulation. He also expects her to have no male friends, which is controlling.\n\nThe woman's intentions were purely financial, and she didn't form emotional connections. She even gave him $1000 as an apology, showing she wanted to make amends. However, he hasn't let it go. Her financial dependence on her parents and the pressure to maintain a stable relationship add to her stress. The boyfriend's own financial issues and family problems might contribute to his instability.\n\nConsidering all this, the woman's actions were a response to her financial situation, and she didn't engage in anything that would be considered cheating or having emotional attachments. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top and based on his own issues and biases. He's not respecting her privacy and her means of coping with her financial struggles. His behavior is more indicative of his own problems rather than her wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the woman isn't in the wrong. The main issues lie with the boyfriend's inability to accept her past actions, his controlling tendencies, and his negative attitudes towards women. She made a choice to support herself financially, which isn't inherently wrong, especially given her circumstances.\n"
