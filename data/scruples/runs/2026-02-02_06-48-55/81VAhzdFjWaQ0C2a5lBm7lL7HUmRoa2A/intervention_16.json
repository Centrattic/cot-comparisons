I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman who used to make money by talking to guys on an app, and her boyfriend, who is 43, calls her a whore for it. She quit the app a year ago but he still brings it up. He has a lot of issues too, like a troubled family and past drug OD.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was using the app for financial reasons because she's a broke college student dependent on her parents. She didn't have any emotional connections and stopped when she felt guilty. On the other hand, her boyfriend has trust issues from past divorces and a family with mental health and addiction problems. He seems to have a very negative view of women, calling them sluts and whores, and has a double standard where he says he can sleep with anyone but she can't.\n\nThe key points here are the context of their relationship, the reasons behind her actions, and his reactions. The author wasn't engaging in anything illegal or explicit; it was light conversation for money. She stopped it when she started dating him, which shows she tried to respect his feelings. However, she didn't inform him about it until later, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is problematic too. His constant belittling, calling her a whore, and threats of breaking up are toxic. His past with ex-wives and family issues contribute to his bitterness, but that doesn't justify his treatment of her. He has a counseling history for bitterness, which might indicate deeper issues he hasn't resolved.\n\nThe financial dependency of the author adds pressure, making her situation more vulnerable. His double standard about male friends and his own behavior (saying he can sleep with anyone) highlights a lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author made a choice she later regretted and tried to address by quitting the app and giving money as a gesture. However, withholding information about her past could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the circumstances\u2014financial need, lack of emotional involvement, and his toxic reactions\u2014it's a complex situation. His behavior is clearly abusive and controlling, which might mitigate her responsibility in the wrong. However, she did keep something significant from him, which could be seen as a mistake. But considering the context, the primary blame might lie more with the boyfriend's toxic behavior than the author's past actions.\n"
