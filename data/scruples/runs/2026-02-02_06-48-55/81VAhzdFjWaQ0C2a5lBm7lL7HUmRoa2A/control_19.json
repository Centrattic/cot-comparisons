I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (a 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong for making money by talking to guys on an app before she was in a relationship with her 43-year-old boyfriend. The boyfriend called her a whore for a year after she confessed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was a broke college student, dependent on her parents. She used an app to earn money, but she didn't have any emotional connections or physical interactions with the guys. She quit the app before the relationship got serious. The boyfriend, who's almost twice her age and going through his second divorce, has a history of bitterness towards women, called them sluts and whores, and has issues with his family. When she told him about the app, he had an angry reaction and continues to bring it up even after a year.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions were non-sexual and for financial reasons, she didn't have feelings for the people she interacted with, and she stopped before the relationship became serious. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a problematic attitude towards women, a history of substance abuse, and financial issues. His reaction is ongoing and abusive, calling her names and threatening to break up. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, using an app to earn money when financially desperate might not be inherently wrong, especially if there's no exploitation or deceit involved. However, relationships require trust and communication. The author didn't keep this a secret but confessed when the relationship was getting serious. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and abusive, given his own issues and the fact that he's critical of other women in his life. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014continuing to call her a whore, not respecting her boundaries (like disapproving of male friends), and his own history of problems\u2014suggests that the issue is more about his control and bitterness rather than her actions. The author's intent was financial support, not infidelity or deceit. So, it's the boyfriend's response that's problematic here. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies more with the boyfriend for his abusive behavior and inability to handle the situation maturely.\n"
