I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 24-year-old woman in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used to make money by talking to guys on an app without any emotional connection, and after she confessed, her boyfriend constantly calls her a whore and is still upset even though she quit a year ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was using the app for money, had no emotional ties, and didn't engage in anything sexual. The boyfriend has a history of bitterness towards women, issues with his family, and has a problematic attitude, including calling other women sluts and whores. He also has a controlling stance, not wanting her to have male friends. The author was financially dependent on her parents and had anxiety about her future, which is why she took the job in the first place.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is explosive anger and ongoing criticism, even after she stopped the activity. He uses the term \"whore\" a lot, which is degrading and suggests a double standard. He also threatens to break up and claims he can do things he wouldn't do, implying hypocrisy. The author feels the pressure from her family not to be with an older partner, adding to her stress.\n\nNow, the question is whether she is in the wrong. On one hand, she did something that her boyfriend found hurtful and didn't disclose it upfront. However, the context is important: she was a broke college student, the job was non-sexual, and she quit after feeling guilty. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly rooted in his own issues with women and control. His behavior includes disrespect and abuse, which is problematic regardless.\n\nThe author's apology and financial gesture show she took responsibility, but the boyfriend isn't letting it go. His constant criticism and name-calling indicate emotional abuse. The situation also involves a significant age gap and power imbalance, with the older man in a more vulnerable position financially due to his issues, yet he's treating the younger woman poorly.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author did make a choice that her partner found offensive, the boyfriend's response is more concerning and abusive. The author's actions, while not perfect in terms of communication, were driven by financial need and lack of experience. The boyfriend's ongoing anger and degrading behavior suggest that he's the one in the wrong, not her. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
