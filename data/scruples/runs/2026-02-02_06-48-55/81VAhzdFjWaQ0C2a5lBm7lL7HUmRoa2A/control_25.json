  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA? I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money before she met her 43-year-old boyfriend. Now, even though she's been off the app for a year, her boyfriend continues to call her names and is angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a broke college student relying on her parents for financial support. She used the app for money, which she clarified wasn't for sexual purposes, just light conversation. She quit the app when she started the relationship and tried to apologize, even giving him $1000. The boyfriend, however, has a history of being in a toxic marriage, has family issues, and seems to have trust issues and bitterness towards women. He calls her a whore repeatedly and is controlling about her having male friends.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and context. The author was honest with her boyfriend about her past, even though he reacted negatively. She didn't engage in anything illegal or unethical, just used an app to make money. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own personal issues and past experiences rather than the act itself. His behavior\u2014calling her derogatory names, controlling her interactions, and being abusive\u2014crosses into emotional abuse territory. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's justification for his anger is unfounded since she's been off the app for a year and has no emotional ties. His inability to move past this and his controlling behavior indicate that he's the one in the wrong here. The author's actions, while perhaps unwise given the relationship context, don't make her the asshole. The boyfriend's ongoing anger and insults are the real issues.\n"
