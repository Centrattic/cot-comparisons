I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to men for money, which her 43-year-old boyfriend found out and has been calling her a whore ever since. They've been in a relationship for a while, and there's a lot of context here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. She used the app for financial reasons, which she explains because she's a broke college student dependent on parents. There's no emotional connection, no sexting, just light conversation. She quit the app after confessing to her boyfriend. So her intention was to earn money, not to have any emotional or physical relationships. That seems like a personal choice, maybe not ideal in a relationship context, but not inherently wrong.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend's reaction. He calls her a whore constantly, which is abusive and degrading. He has a history of being bitter towards women due to his past divorces and family issues. His behavior is toxic, and he doesn't support her financially, which adds stress. He also restricts her from having male friends, which is controlling. The author feels trapped because of her financial dependence and family pressure, especially since they wouldn't support her if her relationship with him was known.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she withheld information about the app until it was a problem. In a relationship, transparency is usually expected. But given her financial situation and the pressure she's under, maybe she felt it was a necessary choice. Also, she stopped the behavior when she felt guilty and tried to apologize by giving money. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and abusive. He's projecting his own issues onto her and not taking responsibility for his anger and controlling behavior.\n\nSo, while she might have made a choice that led to conflict, the boyfriend's actions are more blameworthy here. The author's actions, while perhaps not the best, don't seem malicious. The key points are the lack of emotional connection, her reasons for the app, and the boyfriend's toxic response. The author is not in the wrong because the boyfriend's behavior is the root of the problem. He's not respecting her autonomy and is being abusive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
