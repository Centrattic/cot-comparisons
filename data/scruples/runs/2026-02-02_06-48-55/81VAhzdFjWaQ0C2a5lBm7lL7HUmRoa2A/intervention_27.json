I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA post) is in the wrong in her situation. The main issue is that she used an app to talk to guys non-sexually and made money, and after she confessed to her 43-year-old boyfriend, he constantly calls her a whore and hasn't let go of it even a year later.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the app does. She says she talked to guys for money, no emotional connection, no sexting, just light conversation and maybe promised snuggles. So it's not like she was having affairs or anything sexual. She was a broke college student using the app for financial support, which she later quit. \n\nThen, her boyfriend is 43, went through two divorces, has a history of bitterness towards women, called them sluts and whores. He also has a family with mental health and addiction issues, which he's dealing with. She was supportive, even giving him $1000 as an apology. But he still holds a grudge, argues with her about it weekly, and makes degrading comments. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she did it out of necessity, not for anything inappropriate. She was honest and even tried to make amends. Her current relationship is causing her stress, and his behavior seems toxic and controlling. He's not only holding onto her past but also projecting his negative views onto her, which might indicate deeper issues like jealousy, insecurity, or unresolved trauma from his exes. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has valid concerns about trust and boundaries. However, the constant name-calling and inability to move past it after a year, especially when she's stopped the activity, could be more about his own issues rather than her right or wrong. The fact that he allows himself to have affairs (as he claims he can \"fuck anybody\") while she's being shamed for past actions might show double standards. \n\nAlso, considering her financial dependence on her parents and her anxiety, her actions might be seen as a way to cope with her situation. The boyfriend's response seems disproportionate and harmful, focusing on her past when it's no longer an issue. \n\nSo, while there might be some debate about the app's nature and whether she should have considered his feelings before confessing, his response is more concerning. The answer probably isn't that she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is toxic and shouldn't be excused just because he's dealing with his own problems. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
