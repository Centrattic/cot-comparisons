I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old woman in a relationship with a 43-year-old man. She used to make money through an app by talking to guys, but there was no sexual content. She quit a year ago, but her boyfriend still calls her a whore. He has a history of bitterness towards women from past divorces and has mental health issues in his family. He also has debt and a restraining order against a brother. The author was financially dependent and felt pressured by her family to stay in the relationship. She gave him $1000 as an apology, but he's still upset.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are her actions and his reaction. She used the app for money, non-sexual, and had no emotional connection. She stopped after confessing. However, the boyfriend is using derogatory terms repeatedly, which is problematic. The nature of her job\u2014talking to men for money\u2014could be seen as transactional, but without sexual activity, it's more like a gig economy job. However, the issue is the boyfriend's reaction. He's being abusive, calling her a slur, and threatening to break up. His bitterness towards women is an issue, and his behavior is toxic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have considered the impact of her actions on the relationship. Even though the job itself was non-sexual, the fact that she was earning money from interacting with other men could be a point of contention. But since she stopped and apologized, and he's still not letting go, the fault might lie more with him. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend is so sensitive to her past and continues to abuse her, but she had a legitimate reason (financial need) and no current issue (she quit), then she's not in the wrong. His reaction is the problem. So the answer would be B (No). However, maybe there's an aspect of not being upfront earlier? But she did confess and stopped. His behavior is more concerning. I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend is being unreasonable and abusive, and the author's actions were a past decision made out of financial need. She's also not engaging in anything inherently wrong, just a controversial job choice. The boyfriend's constant name-calling and threats are more indicative of his own issues than her wrongdoing. So the answer is B.\n"
