I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The summary is about a 24-year-old woman (the author) who used an app to talk to guys for money without any emotional connection before she started her relationship with a 43-year-old man. Now, her boyfriend is constantly calling her a whore for it, even after a year since she quit the app.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. She was a broke college student, so she used the app for financial reasons. The key points here are that she had no emotional involvement, didn't sext, and only promised non-sexual things like snuggles. She also gave him $1000 in apology and has been off the app for a year. However, her boyfriend is upset, calls her names, and is threatening to break up. He also has a history of bitterness towards women, given his past experiences and family issues.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, if the author wasn't engaging in anything she's uncomfortable with and it was for financial survival, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the problem here is the boyfriend's reaction. The author is in the relationship now and chose to confess, which is a responsible move. The boyfriend's constant insults and inability to move past it, despite her having quit the app, might indicate his own issues rather than her wrongdoing. He also has a history of degrading comments towards women and sex workers, which is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author might have known about his past issues and his bitterness towards women. If she was aware of his negative views and still decided to participate in an activity that could trigger his insecurities, maybe she's at least somewhat responsible. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The activity itself\u2014talking to guys for money without any sexual activity\u2014doesn't sound inherently wrong. The issue is more about the boyfriend's reaction and his inability to handle her past actions, which could be a red flag for his behavior in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author is in a difficult position financially and has anxiety. She couldn't support herself, so using the app was a way to make money. Her boyfriend's own financial instability (debt, family issues) might be contributing to his controlling behavior. The fact that he encourages her to not have male friends and makes derogatory remarks about strippers suggests a toxic attitude. \n\nBut the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she didn't engage in anything she considers wrong and has stopped the activity, her actions might not be the issue. The problem seems to be the boyfriend's response, which is abusive and irrational. So, the answer probably leans towards B (No), but I need to make sure. \n\nWait, the author is in a relationship now. Maybe she should have been honest from the start, but she did confess before things got serious. Also, the boyfriend's past with his ex-wives being called sluts and whores shows his own problematic behavior. The author's apology and giving money was her trying to make amends, but the boyfriend's continued anger is his issue. So the author isn't in the wrong for using the app for money, but the boyfriend is in the wrong for his reaction and the way he treats her. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
