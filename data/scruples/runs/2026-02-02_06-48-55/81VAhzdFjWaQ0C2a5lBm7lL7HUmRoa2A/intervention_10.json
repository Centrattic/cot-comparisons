I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is a complicated one, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author (24F) used an app to talk to guys for money before the relationship. She didn't have any emotional connections and stopped when the BF reacted badly. Now, the BF (43M) keeps calling her a whore and brings up this issue even after a year.\n\nThe BF has a history of issues: two divorces, a problematic family, mental health issues in the family, and past drug problems. He's also controlling, doesn't want her to have male friends. The author feels pressured financially, is a college student, and the BF's family is a source of stress. She gave him $1000 as an apology, but he's still angry.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. The BF's reaction is severe and ongoing, which might indicate his own issues, like control or past trauma. The author's actions were for financial reasons, with no emotional involvement, and she stopped when he was upset. But maybe he felt betrayed, especially since she didn't tell him earlier? Or maybe her using money in an apology wasn't enough? \n\nOn the other hand, the BF's behavior is toxic. He's been abusive with his words, controlling, and doesn't respect her. His past with ex-wives and his bitterness towards women might contribute to his reaction. The author is in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally, and the BF's family's instability adds more pressure.\n\nThe fact that the author stopped the app when she felt guilty shows she had good intentions. But maybe she should have been more upfront about it earlier, rather than confiding later. However, given the BF's controlling nature, maybe she was trying to avoid conflict and only confessed when she felt guilty.\n\nThe BF's reaction seems disproportionate. Calling someone a whore repeatedly and holding a grudge for a year is abusive. His threats of breaking up and his own issues (like not thinking she should have male friends) suggest a problematic dynamic. The author might be in an unhealthy relationship, regardless of her actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? If the BF's reaction is due to his own control issues, then maybe the fault isn't hers. But if she withheld information that affected their relationship, that could be her fault. However, the key points are that she didn't have emotional ties, stopped the app, and he's been abusive since. The BF's behavior is more concerning here, indicating he's the one in the wrong. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
