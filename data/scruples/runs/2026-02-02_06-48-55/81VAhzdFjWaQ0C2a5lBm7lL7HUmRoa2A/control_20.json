I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 24-year-old woman who used to earn money by talking to men through an app before she started dating her 43-year-old boyfriend. She didn't have any emotional connections with those guys and stopped the job once she started the relationship. Now, her boyfriend constantly calls her a \"whore\" because of this, even though she's been off the app for a year. \n\nFirst, I need to consider whether she did anything wrong. The key points here are her intentions and the nature of the job. She clarifies that there was no emotional involvement or sexual activity\u2014just light conversation for money. It sounds like she was doing it out of financial necessity as a broke college student. She also apologized and gave him money to show her remorse. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He has a history of bitterness towards women, as mentioned by his treatment of ex-wives and his negative views towards sex workers and strippers. His behavior, including calling her names and threatening to break up, seems controlling and possibly abusive. His own family situation is chaotic, which might contribute to his stress and how he handles the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she was acting out of financial need and stopped once the relationship started. The boyfriend's issue might be more about his own insecurities and past experiences rather than her actual actions. Also, he's in a position where he's older, has his own financial issues, and seems to hold her to a standard that might not be fair, given his own background. \n\nBut the ethical part is about her actions. She didn't engage in anything harmful, according to her, and she stopped when she started the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, but the question is about her. So maybe she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that she should have been upfront about it from the start. But since she did tell him and he reacted so negatively, it's more about his reaction than her actions. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards her not being wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not her past job, especially since she took steps to address his feelings once she felt guilty.\n"
