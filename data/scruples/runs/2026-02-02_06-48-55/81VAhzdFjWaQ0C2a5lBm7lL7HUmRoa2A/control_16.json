I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money before she started dating her current 43-year-old boyfriend. Now, he's constantly calling her a whore and being abusive about it, even after she quit the app a year ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was using the app for financial reasons, which she needed because she's a broke college student. She states there was no emotional connection, no sexting, just light conversation. She quit when she started the relationship and felt guilty. She confided in her boyfriend, but he reacted with anger and continues to be abusive.\n\nThe boyfriend has a troubled family background and a history of issues, including drug OD and debt. He's judgmental towards women, calling them sluts and whores, and has a distrust of male friends. The woman feels trapped because of her financial dependence on her parents and the boyfriend's threats. She gave him $1000 in apology, but he still holds it against her.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. She used the app before the relationship, quit when she started dating him, and was honest about it. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and controlling. His constant name-calling and threats are abusive. The woman's actions predate the relationship, and she didn't continue it once they were together. His behavior is more about his own issues, like past traumas and bitterness towards women, rather than her actions. She's in a financially unstable position, which adds to her vulnerability.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He's not holding himself accountable but instead projecting his issues onto her. His threats and lack of forgiveness are signs of emotional abuse. The fact that he's almost twice her age and she's in a dependent position makes the power imbalance significant. She's trying to be supportive despite his family's issues, but he's not respecting her boundaries or past.\n\nSo, considering all that, the woman isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend's abusive behavior and inability to move past this, which is his fault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
