I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a 24-year-old woman who used an app to talk to guys for money before her relationship with a 43-year-old man. Now that she's in the relationship, he's been calling her a whore constantly for over a year after she confessed to using the app.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The author was a broke college student, financially dependent on her parents. She used the app for money, had no emotional connections, and hasn't done it in a year. The boyfriend, who is older and had a previous divorce with a history of bitterness towards women, reacted explosively. He has family issues (sister with schizophrenia, brother with addiction, mom on Xanax), which adds to his stress. He's also in debt and has a history of heroin overdose. The author feels supported by him and has been trying to be understanding of his family issues.\n\nThe key points here are the motivations of both parties. The author's actions were purely for financial reasons, without any emotional involvement. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly rooted in his own issues, including his past with ex-wives and his family's problems. His behavior\u2014calling her names, threatening to break up, and holding a past mistake for over a year\u2014suggests controlling or emotionally abusive tendencies.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be seen as a personal choice made due to financial necessity. However, the boyfriend's response is the main issue here. It's not just about whether she did something wrong, but how he's handling it. If he's unable to move past it despite her apology and changed behavior, that indicates his own problems. The fact that he's critical of sex workers but not of his own behavior (like threatening her) also shows inconsistency.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. While using the app might have been a questionable decision, given her circumstances, it's not inherently wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning. The answer here hinges on the idea that while the author made a choice with her own motivations, the boyfriend's response is disproportionate and harmful. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the boyfriend's actions are problematic.\n"
