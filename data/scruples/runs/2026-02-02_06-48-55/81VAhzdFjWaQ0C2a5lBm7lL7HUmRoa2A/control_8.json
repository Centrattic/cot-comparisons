I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the relationship, the actions taken by both parties, and the emotional dynamics at play.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old college student who used an app to earn money by talking to guys non-sexually before the relationship. She quit the app a year ago after confessing to her 43-year-old boyfriend. The boyfriend is dealing with recent divorce issues, has a troubled family background, and seems to have trust issues, calling her names and being controlling. He's also made derogatory remarks about women in general and doesn't allow her to have male friends. The author gave him $1000 as an apology, but he continues to bring up the issue, threatening to break up and making controlling statements.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The author's actions were done for financial reasons, which is understandable given her situation as a broke student. She explicitly stated there was no emotional connection or sexual content involved. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, and his behavior includes emotional abuse, controlling tendencies, and lack of trust. His history of multiple divorces and family problems might contribute to his unstable behavior, but that doesn't justify his treatment of her.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't inherently in the wrong for seeking financial support through a legitimate means (assuming the app is legal), especially when she has no emotional ties. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is displaying toxic behaviors. The key here is that the author made a choice she later felt guilty about, but the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and harmful. The fact that he doesn't apply the same standards to himself (like his comments about other women and his own behavior) suggests that his issue isn't about her actions but about his own control and bitterness.\n\nTherefore, while the author might have made a mistake in not considering how it would affect the relationship, the primary wrong lies with the boyfriend's abusive behavior. The author is not in the wrong for doing what she felt was necessary and for trying to make amends.\n"
