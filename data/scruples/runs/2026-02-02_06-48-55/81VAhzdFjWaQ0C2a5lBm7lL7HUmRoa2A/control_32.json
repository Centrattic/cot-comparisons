I (24F) made money from an app talking to guys (non sexual) &amp; I have no emotional connection towards them. 43M bf calls me a whore constantly since I\u2019ve confessed. Holds this against me and it\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve quit it.\nI\u2019m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I\u2019m a broke college student who\u2019s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He\u2019d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don\u2019t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn\u2019t think I should have male friends, because \u201cthey all want to fuck me\u201d.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD\u2019d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we\u2019ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I\u2019m an idiot for thinking that he\u2019ll even do that.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been off the app. It\u2019s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would\u2019ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that she was earning money by talking to guys on an app but had no emotional connection. Her boyfriend, who's older and has a complicated background, calls her a whore constantly after she confessed. He's been holding this against her for a year even after she quit the app.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was using the app for financial reasons because she's a broke college student. She didn't have any emotional involvement, didn't sext, and stopped after she felt guilty and told her boyfriend. She gave him money as an apology. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a history of bitterness towards women due to his past, has mental health issues in the family, and seems to have trust issues. His reaction seems extreme and ongoing, even after a year.\n\nNow, the key points here. Was she wrong for using the app? She might have felt it was necessary for financial support. Many people have different jobs, and this might be her way to make ends meet. However, the fact that she was making money for personal gain, even if non-sexual, could be a point of contention in a relationship. But the main issue is how her boyfriend is handling it. He's calling her names repeatedly, threatening breakups, and acting possessively. His behavior seems toxic and controlling, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's history with his ex-wives and his family's issues might contribute to his insecurity and bitterness. However, that doesn't excuse his constant derogatory language. The author's intention was to be transparent when she confessed, and she stopped the behavior. The fact that he's still holding a grudge and not allowing the issue to be resolved suggests that he's the one with the problem here.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. The author did communicate her actions, which is good. The boyfriend's inability to move past this and his controlling behavior (not allowing male friends) are more concerning. The author is in a financially dependent situation, which might make her feel trapped, but she's trying her best to manage the situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might not be wrong, given her circumstances. The boyfriend's reaction and ongoing behavior are more problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
