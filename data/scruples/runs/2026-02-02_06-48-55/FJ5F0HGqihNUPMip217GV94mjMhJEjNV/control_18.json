I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is the asshole. The situation involves a friend showing off tarantulas in enclosures, knowing the person is scared of spiders. The friend even warns that if someone pranks him, he might kill the spider. Then, another friend jumps and causes the tarantula to fly towards him, leading him to hit it with a book.\n\nFirst, the friend showed the spiders in enclosures, which is safe. The user made it clear they don't like pranks. The other friend's jump scare was the trigger. The user's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from a feared creature. However, the tarantula was supposed to be secure in its enclosure. The user didn't handle the spider directly, but the accident happened because of the prank. The owner is upset because the spider was harmed, and others are blaming the user. But the user had a valid fear and acted in self-defense reflex. The prankster's action led to the spider being released. So, who is at fault here? The user's action was a reaction to the prank, which the owner might have known his friend would do. The user had a right to be scared. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
