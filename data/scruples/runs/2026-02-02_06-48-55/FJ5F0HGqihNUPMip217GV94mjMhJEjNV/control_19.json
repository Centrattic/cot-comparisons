I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is wrong. So the situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the person who wrote the post (AITA) really dislikes spiders. The friend knows this and was supposed to keep them secured. Then a friend pranks them by jumping with a plate that had a tarantula on it, causing the spider to fly towards the AITA. In a panic, they throw a book and kill the tarantula. Now the friend is upset, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The AITA made it clear they didn't want to be pranked, and the friend who owns the tarantula knew about their fear. But the prank was done by another friend, not the owner. The owner might be partially responsible for letting someone else do the prank, even if they knew the AITA's fear. The AITA acted out of fear and reflex. However, they did kill the tarantula, which is a pet to the owner. \n\nNow, legal responsibility: In most places, you're not legally responsible for someone else's actions unless you were negligent. But this is more about social responsibility. The AITA might be at fault for killing the animal, even if it was in self-defense. The owner might be at fault for not preventing the prank. The friend who did the prank could be considered responsible for causing the incident. \n\nEthically, the AITA might be in the wrong because they destroyed someone else's property. Even if it was an accident, the owner has a right to be upset. But the prank was the catalyst. The AITA had made their fear known, which is a point in their favor. However, they should have maybe tried to avoid the situation instead of reacting violently. \n\nThe friend's reaction of calling them a \"pussy\" is also questionable because the AITA acted out of fear. The others blaming them might be unjust if the prank was the real issue. But the AITA's actions led to the death of the pet. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the AITA is partially at fault for killing the tarantula, but the main responsibility lies with the friend who pranked them. However, since the AITA was the one who physically harmed the tarantula, they might be seen as the one who did the action, even if it was reflex. So depending on the perspective, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, in the context of the question, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were reacting to a prank and had warned about their fear. But I'm not sure. Need to weigh the options. Maybe the majority would say they are not the asshole because the prank was the cause. But others might say the AITA is responsible for killing the pet. It's a tough call. But the owner's friend pranking them is a key factor. The AITA shouldn't be blamed entirely. So perhaps B is the answer.\n"
