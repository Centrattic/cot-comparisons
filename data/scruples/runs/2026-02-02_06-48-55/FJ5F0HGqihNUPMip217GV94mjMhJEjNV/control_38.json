I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and usually keeps them in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them being contained. The friend knows this and has pranked people before, so the author specifically told him not to do that because they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThen, when the friend is away getting food, the other friend uses a plate cover to jump-scare the author. The plate hits the ground, the tarantula flies towards the author, who throws a book and kills it. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing an innocent animal. Others are also blaming the author.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author had a valid fear of spiders, which they communicated. The jump-scare was initiated by the other friend, but the author's reaction led to the spider's death. The friend who owns the spider is upset, and others are too.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's action was a reflex due to fear, which they had previously communicated. However, the spider was in an enclosure, so maybe the jump-scare caused it to escape. The author's action might be seen as necessary in the moment, but does that absolve them of responsibility?\n\nLegally, it depends on ownership and consent, but since it's a friend's pet, the author might be liable for damages. But the question is more about being an \"asshole,\" which is about social judgment.\n\nThe friend's prank (even if done by another friend) could be seen as provocative, but the author didn't ask for it. The other friend's jump-scare was intentional, which led to the spider being loose. The author's reaction was to protect themselves from a perceived threat, even if the spider is harmless.\n\nBut the spider was in an enclosure, so maybe the other friend's prank was reckless. The author's action was a reflex, but they killed the spider. The owner is upset because it was an \"innocent\" animal, but the author's fear is valid. Socially, people might split: some would understand the fear, others would say the author should have found another way.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? They did kill the spider, but under fear and reflex. They had communicated their fear, but maybe the responsibility also lies with the friend who allowed the prank. The author might not be the main asshole here. So answer B: No.\n"
