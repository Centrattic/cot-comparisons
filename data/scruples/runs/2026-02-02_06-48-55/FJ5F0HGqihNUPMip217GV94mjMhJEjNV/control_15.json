I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas and shows them off. The writer is afraid of spiders but is okay with them in their enclosures. They made it clear that if the friend pranked them, they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, during a game session, the friend leaves to get food. Another friend does a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the writer. In a panic, the writer throws a book and kills the tarantula.\n\nThe friend is upset, calling the writer a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing an harmless animal. Others are also blaming them. The user wants to know if the writer is the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few factors. The key points are intent, provocation, and responsibility.\n\nThe author had a clear aversion to spiders but was okay with them being contained. They warned the friend not to prank them. The jump scare was initiated by the other friend, not the friend who owns the tarantula. The tarantula was out of its enclosure, which the owner might have been responsible for if it was his idea to place it on the plate. However, the jump scare happened when the owner was away. \n\nThe author's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a sudden, scary event. The tarantula was in an unsafe situation because of the jump scare. The owner's pranking history might indicate that they knew the risk of such actions. The other friend's prank directly led to the incident. \n\nHowever, the author could have tried to catch the spider instead of killing it. But given the fear and the reflex action, maybe it's understandable. The friend's anger and calling the author a \"pussy\" might be out of proportion if the spider was valuable or sentimental. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the other friend's prank was the immediate cause. The owner might have put the spider in a place where it could be disturbed. The author's action was a reaction to a sudden threat, even if unintended. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had a legitimate fear, the tarantula was out of its enclosure due to the prank, and the jump scare was the catalyst. The friend's anger might be more about the loss of the pet and the insult than the action itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the author should have tried to stop the spider without killing it, but given the circumstances, it's a split decision. However, in AITA scenarios, people often consider the emotional impact and intent. The author's intent was self-defense, even if it led to the spider's death. So probably B.\n"
