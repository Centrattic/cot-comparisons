I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas in enclosures. The person hates spiders and made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. Another friend did a jump scare with a plate that caused the tarantula to fly towards them, leading the person to throw a book and kill it. The friend is upset, and others are blaming them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person made their dislike of spiders clear and specified not to prank them. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but the jump scare caused it to escape. The person acted out of fear, which is a common reaction. However, intentionally killing an animal, even out of fear, could be seen as problematic. But the context is important here: they were startled, and the tarantula was suddenly in their space. \n\nThe friend who set up the prank might be at fault for not respecting the person's boundaries. If they knew the person was afraid, doing a jump scare with a live animal seems reckless. The other friend who took the cover off might also share responsibility. \n\nHowever, the person who killed the spider could be seen as acting in a panic. But they had a choice in the moment. Even if scared, intentionally killing the spider could be seen as a lack of consideration for the owner's property. On the other hand, the prank was the initial wrongdoing. So, is the person wrong for reacting as they did?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the pranksters are more at fault. But legally, the person might still be liable for damaging someone's property. Emotionally, the person's fear is valid, but the action of killing the tarantula is irreversible. So, the answer might hinge on whether the action was justified given the circumstances. \n\nI think the person is partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, since they chose to throw the book and kill the tarantula, even in fear, they might be considered responsible. So the answer could be A (they are the asshole) because they destroyed someone else's property, even if provoked. But some might argue the prank was the main issue. It's a bit of a gray area, but depending on the perspective, the answer could vary. However, the community often looks at intent and responsibility. The person's fear is understandable, but the action might still be considered wrong.\n"
