I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the author killed their friend's tarantula. Let me read through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nThe friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders and told the friend not to prank them with the spiders. The friend knows this. Then, while they're playing PS4, the friend goes to get food. Another friend uses a plate cover to jump-scare the author, which causes the tarantula to fly towards them. The author throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are whether the author is responsible for killing the tarantula. The friend had the spider in an enclosure, which is supposed to be safe. The author had made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. The jump-scare was done by another friend, who hit the plate and caused the spider to escape. The author acted out of fear, throwing a book in reflex.\n\nFirst, the author's friend was aware of the dislike for spiders and the possibility of pranks. The other friend, though, was the one who initiated the jump-scare. The author's action was a reflex to protect themselves. But the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nIf the friend had properly secured the enclosure, maybe the spider wouldn't have escaped. However, the other friend's action led to the incident. The author's reaction might be understandable given their fear, but intentionally killing an animal, even in fear, could be seen as wrong. But was it an intentional act or an impulsive reflex?\n\nThe author threw the book to hit the spider, which killed it. Even if it was a reflex, they still made a choice to act. But considering the context, maybe they weren't intending to kill it but just to hit it out of fear. However, the result is still the death of the spider. \n\nFriends might argue that the author should have controlled their fear better, but the friend who set up the enclosure and allowed the jump-scare might also be at fault. The one who did the jump-scare is responsible for the spider escaping, but the author is the one who killed it. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? If the other friend hadn't jumped, the spider wouldn't have come out. But the author did kill it. The friend who owns the spider might be upset because the author didn't handle the situation differently, like trying to catch it or not reacting. But the author's action was a reflex. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely at fault if the other friend's prank was the main cause, but they did kill the spider. However, the owner should have ensured the enclosures were secure, especially knowing the author's fear. The author's action was in response to an unexpected jump-scare, which the other friend caused. So maybe the other friend is more at fault, but the author's action still led to the death. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be seen as the one who caused the death, even if it was a reflex. So maybe they are at fault. But others might argue that the prank was the real problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend who owned the spider might feel wronged because the author didn't respect the animal's life. However, considering the fear and the sudden scare, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer depends on whose perspective you take. The author might not be the sole culprit, but they did kill the spider. So maybe AITA (Am I the Asshole) would say they are, because they could have tried to avoid it. But others might see the prank as the main issue. The author's action was a direct cause, so maybe they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
