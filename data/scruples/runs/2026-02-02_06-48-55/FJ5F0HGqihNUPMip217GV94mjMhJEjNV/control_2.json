I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend had shown the tarantulas in their enclosures, and the author made it clear that they didn't want to be pranked with them. Then, when the friend was away, the other friend did a jump scare with the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, scared, threw a book and killed the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a phobia of spiders and had already told their friend not to prank them with the tarantulas. The friend, knowing this, might have still allowed the prank to happen. The other friend's action led to the tarantula being thrown towards the author. The author's reaction was a reflex to throw a book, which resulted in the spider's death.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, they had communicated their fear, and the prank was done by someone else. The author acted out of fear in a split second. However, the spider was in an enclosure, so maybe the other friend's prank was the real issue here. The author's friend is upset because the tarantula was killed, but the prank might have been the catalyst. The author might be seen as acting in self-preservation, but others might argue that they should have known the spider was contained and handled the situation differently. However, given the fear and the suddenness, it's a reflex action. So maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. The other friend's prank was probably the main problem. The author's friend should have respected their fear. Therefore, the answer might be B, but I need to check if there's any part where the author could be at fault. The author had the spider in an enclosure, but the other friend's prank caused it to be thrown. The author's action was a reflex. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
