I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about killing a friend's tarantula. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in their enclosures. The writer doesn't like spiders but is okay when they're secured. The friend is aware of this and supposedly shows them in their enclosures. However, there's a mention that the friend has pranked people before, so the writer made it clear to never do that to them because they'd kill the spider out of fear.\n\nNow, during a gaming session, the friend gets food and brings it back. Another friend uses a plate cover for a jump scare, which causes the tarantula to fly toward the writer. The writer, in a panic, throws a book and kills the tarantula. The friend is upset, calling the writer a \"pussy\" and saying it was an innocent animal. Others are blaming the writer too, and there's even an angry message from someone else who also has tarantulas.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let me consider different angles. Legally, maybe not, since the spider was thrown at them. Ethically, they had a phobia and acted in fear. However, the friend had warned about pranks, and the jump scare was a prank by another friend. The writer's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves. But the friend who owns the spider might feel betrayed, especially if they believed the writer wouldn't act that way. Also, the spider was in an enclosure initially, but the prank caused it to be released. The other friend's prank might be the real issue here.\n\nThe writer did warn the spider owner that any prank involving the spiders would lead to them killing it. Since the prank happened despite the warning, maybe the writer is justified. But maybe the writer should have handled it differently, like catching the spider instead. However, in the moment, panic sets in. The community might split here. Some might say the writer was in their right to protect themselves from fear, others might say they should have found another way. Considering the context, the writer's actions were a direct result of a prank they warned against. The owner's friend pranked them, leading to the incident. So the blame might lie more with the prankster, not the writer. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
