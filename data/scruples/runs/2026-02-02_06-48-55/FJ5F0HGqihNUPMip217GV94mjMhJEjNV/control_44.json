I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas, which the author doesn't like. The friend showed them in their enclosures, and the author made it clear not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, during a game night, when the friend was getting food, the other friend jumped and caused the plate with the tarantula to hit the author. The author threw a book in reflex and killed it.\n\nFirst, the author had a fear of spiders and communicated that clearly. The friend knew about this fear and still might have set up a situation where a prank could happen. The other friend's jump scare led directly to the accident. So, the author's reaction was a reflex to a sudden, scary situation. Since the tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the act of throwing a book to kill the spider could be seen as overreacting, even if it was a reflex. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, but the author had warned against pranks. The other people are blaming the author, but maybe they should look at the friend who didn't prevent the prank despite knowing the author's fear. So, maybe the author isn't the asshole here because they acted out of fear in a situation that wasn't their fault. The main issue is the prank, not the author's action.\n"
