I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The scenario is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author is afraid of spiders, and there was a jump scare that caused the spider to fly towards them. The author threw a book, killing the spider, and now their friend is upset.\n\nFirst, the author didn't like spiders and made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. The friend knew this but still had the tarantulas on display. The jump scare was caused by the other friend, who took off the plate cover and startled the author. The author acted in panic, using a book to hit the spider. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the tarantula was in an enclosure, right? The friend showed them as usual, so maybe the enclosures were supposed to keep them secure. But during the jump scare, the spider got loose. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from fear. They didn't intentionally kill the spider, but did so out of panic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had warned against pranks, and maybe the friend should have been more careful with the tarantulas' enclosures. Also, the other friend's jump scare might be part of the problem, but the author still had a choice in how to react. However, in a moment of fear, throwing a book to hit the spider might be a natural reaction. \n\nThe friend is upset because the spider was \"harmless,\" but the author's fear led to its death. The author might be responsible for the spider's death, but the jump scare was the initial cause. The question is whether the author had a duty to handle the situation differently. Since it was a reflex and the spider was loose because of another person's action, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But perhaps they should have tried to catch it or seek help instead of killing it. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being partially at fault because they could have tried another method, but given the fear and reflex, maybe not entirely. However, the enclosures were supposed to prevent such incidents. The friend's responsibility might be in having the tarantulas in a setup that allowed them to escape during a jump scare. So maybe the author isn't the sole person at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acted in a way they knew would kill the spider, maybe. But they threw a book reflexively, not intending to kill. So maybe they're not the asshole. Hmm.\n"
