I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person doesn't like spiders and their friend knows this. The friend has tarantulas in enclosures, which the person is okay with as long as they're secure. The friend has a history of pranks, so the person told him not to do anything like that. Then, during a PS4 game, the friend goes to get food. Another friend takes a plate cover off, jumps, and causes the tarantula to fly towards the person. In a panic, they throw a book and kill the spider. Now the friend is mad, and others are blaming them. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, first, the key points. The person made it clear they hate spiders and don't want pranks. The friend's other person did the jump scare, causing the spider to come towards them. The person acted in fear. But the owner of the tarantula is upset because it was an \"harmless animal,\" and others are blaming them.\n\nLegally, probably not. The tarantula was someone else's property, but the person acted in fear. But morally or socially? Well, the person had a phobia and made their feelings clear. However, they killed the animal, which their friend valued. The jump scare was done by another person, which complicates things. Did the person have a right to defend themselves from the fear-induced threat? Or did they overreact?\n\nThe friend's other person was part of the prank, so maybe they share some blame. The owner might have also not taken precautions if he knew the person was afraid. But the person did kill the tarantula, which is a pet. So depending on the culture, people might see this as justified (because of the phobia and the prank) or as wrong because the spider wasn't a danger.\n\nIn AITA situations, often the person who acted out of fear but damaged someone else's property might be considered not the asshole if the situation was provoked (like the prank). But some might argue that they should have controlled their reaction. However, given that the person had made their aversion known and the prank was a factor, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, they might be seen as overreacting.\n\nI think in this case, the prank was a contributing factor. The other friend's actions led to the spider being thrown. The person had a legitimate fear they communicated. So maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. But others might say they should have found another way to handle it. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because of the provocation and their prior warnings.\n"
