I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, the situation: The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them in enclosures. The friend has tarantulas and shows them. The author made it clear not to prank them with the spiders. Then, during a PS4 session, the friend leaves to get food. Another friend uses a plate cover to jump scare the author, causing the tarantula to fly towards them. The author reflexively throws a book, killing the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, the author had a phobia, which is valid. They communicated their discomfort and warning about pranks. The jump scare was initiated by another friend, not the tarantula owner. So the tarantula was in its enclosure, the friend left it, but the other person's prank caused the accident. The author acted in reflex to a fear trigger.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are intent and responsibility. Did they intentionally kill the tarantula? No, it was a reflex action due to fear. However, they did throw a book, which was the direct cause. But given the context, the prank was unexpected, and the author's reaction might be excusable due to their phobia. \n\nBut some might argue that the author could have controlled their fear instead of acting impulsively. Also, the friend who owns the tarantula might have been negligent by not securing it better. However, the author had already warned against pranks. The other friend's prank was the real issue here. \n\nIn AITA questions, often the person who acts under stress or fear might be seen as less at fault if they had prior warnings. The author's actions were a result of the prank, so the blame might shift more to the prankster. But the author still caused the death. The friend's anger and others' blame could be because the tarantula was a pet, and the author didn't try to catch it or handle it safely. Instead, they killed it on reflex. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the author's fear was a trigger. The prank was a direct cause. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, they did kill the animal. The answer might depend on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since they had a known phobia and clear warning, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nHmm. So the answer could be B (No), because the author wasn't at fault, it was the prankster's fault. But the author still did the action. But in AITA, if the person was provoked or acted under extreme fear, they might not be the asshole. So maybe B is correct here.\n"
