I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. So, first, I need to break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe friend has tarantulas, and the writer doesn't like spiders. They were at the friend's house, and the tarantula was in its enclosure. The writer made it clear they wouldn't want the friend to prank them with the spider because they'd react badly. Then, the other friend did a jump scare, causing the plate to hit the enclosure, making the tarantula fly toward the writer. In a panic, the writer threw a book and killed the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the writer a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The tarantula was in an enclosure, so the friend was presumably taking care to keep it safe. The writer was warned not to prank them, which the friend might have ignored if he did it anyway. However, in this case, the jump scare was done by the other friend, not the owner of the tarantula. The writer acted in fear, which they mentioned beforehand. The question is whether the writer is responsible for the tarantula's death.\n\nOn one hand, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the other friend's prank caused the accident. The writer wasn't trying to harm it but reacted in fear. On the other hand, the tarantula was someone's pet, and the writer's action resulted in its death. But the circumstances were accidental due to the prank.\n\nAlso, the owner's friend did the prank, leading to the incident. The writer might not be at fault because they were a victim of the prank. However, maybe there's an expectation that even in a panic, they should have tried to contain the situation differently. But given the fear and reflex action, it's a split-second reaction.\n\nThe friend's anger seems misplaced if he knew the writer's fear and still allowed the prank. The other people blaming the writer might not understand the context. The writer's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a sudden, scary situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the prankster might be more at fault for causing the accident. The writer was honest about their fear and the friend still pranked them, which could be the real issue. So the answer might lean towards the writer not being the asshole (B), as they acted in fear under the circumstances caused by another's prank.\n"
