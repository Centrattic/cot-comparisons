I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author killing their friend's tarantula. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay if they're secured. The friend knows this and supposedly promised not to prank them. Then, the friend brings a plate with a cover, but it's actually a tarantula. Another friend jumps, causing the spider to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills it. The friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend pranked despite knowing the author's fear, the prank resulted in the spider being thrown at the author, leading to the author acting on reflex. The author claims they were scared and reacted instinctively. The friend's actions set up the scenario where the author felt threatened. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The friend knew about the fear and set up a prank that directly triggered the reaction. The author's action was a reflex to a sudden, scary situation. The friend's prank seems to be the root cause here. The author might not be in the wrong if the prank was the initiating factor. However, some might argue that the author's reaction was excessive. But given the context of the prank and the fear, it's plausible the author isn't at fault. The friend's responsibility to respect the author's fear and not set up a harmful prank could shift the blame away from the author.\n"
