I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend had the spider in an enclosure, and the author is okay with that. The friend knows the author is scared of spiders and had warned against pranking them. Then, when the friend brings in a plate covered with a plate cover, the other friend does a jump scare, hits the plate, and the tarantula flies toward the author. The author throws a book in reflex and kills it.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't like spiders and would kill it if they ever did something. The friend knew that. Now, the jump scare was initiated by the other friend, not the author. But the author's reaction was to throw a book. The question is whether that was justified.\n\nThe friend is upset because the tarantula was harmless and the author is being called a \"pussy.\" Others are blaming the author. But the author acted out of fear, which they had already communicated. The friend, however, might feel that the author overreacted, even if the spider was in a container. The key points are whether the author's action was reasonable given their phobia and the sudden scare. Since the spider was in a container, maybe it's considered reckless to handle it in a way that could cause it to escape or be harmed. But the author's reaction was reflexive to a fear they had already expressed. The friend's pranking might have been the catalyst. But the author's action led to the death of the tarantula. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author might be seen as responsible because they chose to kill the spider, even if it was out of fear. On the other hand, the friend's handling (or the jump scare) might have been negligent. The answer depends on whether the author's fear was a valid excuse for killing the spider. Since the friend knew the author's fear, maybe the friend should have been more careful, but the author's action was direct. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had a known fear and acted in reflex, but others might see it as unnecessary. So the answer is B (No).\n"
