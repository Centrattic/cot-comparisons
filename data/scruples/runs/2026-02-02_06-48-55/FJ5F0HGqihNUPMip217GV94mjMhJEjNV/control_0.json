I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author killing a friend's tarantula during a jump scare.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author is uncomfortable with spiders but okay if they're secured. The friend knows the author's fear and promised not to prank them. However, another friend uses a plate cover to jump scare the author, causing a tarantula to fly towards them. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and responsibility. The author didn't intend to kill the tarantula; it was an accident caused by a jump scare. The other friend's action was the prank, which the author had warned against. The friend who owns the tarantula might be at fault for not stopping the prank or ensuring the tarantula's safety. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which is a friend's property. But was the author justified in their reaction due to fear?\n\nThe friend had agreed not to prank the author, so the other friend's action might be the main issue. However, the author's response was to kill the tarantula out of fear, which might be seen as excessive. But considering the context of being startled and acting on reflex, maybe it's understandable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the accidental killing despite the circumstances. Also, the friend who owns the tarantula might share some blame for not preventing the prank or not securing the tarantula better. The community might look at the author's fear as a valid reason, but others might argue that they should have found another way to handle the situation without killing the pet. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider both parties' actions. Here, the prank was the catalyst, but the author's action led to the death. However, the prank was against the author's explicit warning. So maybe the blame is shared. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If the prank was the main issue, then the author isn't entirely at fault. But the act of killing the spider, even in fear, could be seen as their responsibility. However, given the circumstances, it's possible the author isn't the asshole here because it was an accident and a reflex action. The friend's anger and others' blaming might be misplaced. So, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
