I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula.\n\nFirst, the setup: the friend has tarantulas, the author doesn't like spiders. They were shown the spiders in enclosures. The author made it clear they don't want to be pranked. The friend went to get food, another friend used a microwave cover for a jump scare, hit the plate, and the tarantula flew towards the author. The author threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was afraid of spiders but was okay with them in enclosures. The friend knew this and had pranked others before. The other friend set up the jump scare. The tarantula wasn't in an enclosure at that moment, which caused the author to react out of fear.\n\nThe author's defense is that it was a reflex action due to fear. But the friend had warned not to prank them, and the other friend did it anyway. However, the author ended up killing the tarantula. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue they were in a stressful situation and reacted instinctively. But on the other hand, the tarantula was a pet, and killing it could be seen as intentional in the sense that they threw the book directly at it. Even if it was a reflex, the author's action directly caused the death.\n\nThe friend had a right to be upset. Tarantulas are kept as pets, and others (like the guy with tarantulas) are also upset. The author's action might be seen as negligent or disrespectful. Even if they were scared, the consequence was significant.\n\nBut wait, the author had made it clear they'd likely kill it if pranked. The friend knew this. The other friend set up the prank. So maybe the prank was the main issue here. The author might not be entirely at fault if the prank was the catalyst. However, the author still made the choice to throw the book. Even if it was a reflex, they had to know that throwing a book would kill it. So maybe the author is partially responsible, but the pranksters are too.\n\nBut according to the story, the author is the one who killed the tarantula. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The friend was upset, others blamed them. The author's action might be seen as overreacting, especially since the tarantula wasn't in an enclosure. If it was a reflex, maybe it's understandable, but the result is a dead pet. The friend's anger might be justified. However, the prank setup by the other friend was reckless. Maybe the author isn't entirely to blame.\n\nBut according to the rules, the author is the one who took action. Even if provoked, the act of killing the animal could be seen as the problem. So perhaps the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the prank was the main issue, the author might not be. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often look at intent. The author didn't intend to kill, but the action did. If someone else caused the tarantula to be in that position, maybe the author isn't to blame. But since the author made the choice to throw the book, even if it was a reflex, they might be considered responsible. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because their reaction, while understandable, resulted in the death of the tarantula, which the friend had a right to be upset about. Even if it was a reflex, the action was direct and caused harm. The prank was a factor, but the author's action is the immediate cause.\n"
