I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them if they're secured. The friend knows this and the author made it clear not to prank them with the spiders. Then, while the friend is away, the other friend does a jump scare with a plate that causes the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a reflex, the author throws a book and kills the spider. The friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are whether the author was justified in their actions. The friend set up the tarantulas properly, and the author had warned them not to prank. The other friend's prank directly led to the spider being thrown at the author. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from fear. \n\nBut the friend is upset, and others are blaming the author. The question is about responsibility. The author didn't intend to harm the spider, but their reflex action did. Was the prank a factor that the author could have foreseen? The author was aware that the other friend had pranked people before. \n\nSo, the author might argue that they were in fear and acted on instinct. However, they did kill the tarantula, which the friend obviously valued. But the prank was the catalyst. If the prank was the direct cause, maybe the author isn't solely at fault. On the other hand, maybe they should have handled it differently, like trying to catch it instead of killing it. \n\nBut the situation is a bit of a prank gone wrong. The friend who owns the spider is upset, but the prankster friend might share some blame. The author's intention was not to harm the spider, but they did. However, given the context of the prank and their fear, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they acted in reflex due to a prank they were aware of. But it's a bit of a grey area. Some might say that they should have found another way to avoid killing it. However, given the circumstances, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
