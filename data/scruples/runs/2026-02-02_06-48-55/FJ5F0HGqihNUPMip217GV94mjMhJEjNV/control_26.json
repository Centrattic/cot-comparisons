I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. So, let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas, which he shows in enclosures. The author is told they're secured, so the friend knows the author is afraid of spiders. The author made it clear that if the friend ever pranks them with the tarantula, they'd kill it out of fear. \n\nThen, during a PS4 session, the friend goes to get food. The other friend jumps, hits the plate (which has a cover), causing the tarantula to fly toward the author. In a reflex, the author throws a book and kills the tarantula. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too. The author is wondering if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nHmm. So key points here: the tarantula was in an enclosure, but someone else's action (the jump scare with the plate) caused it to escape. The author had a valid fear and a prior warning about pranks. The action was a reflex. The friend's reaction seems harsh, especially since they knew the author's phobia. Also, the other person with tarantulas sent an angry message, which might indicate the tarantula was valuable or the friend is particularly invested.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the tarantula was in an enclosure initially. The escape was due to another person's action (the jump scare), not the author's. The author had a justified fear and acted in reflex. The friend was warned about pranks, so maybe he's partially responsible for setting up a situation that could lead to this. However, intentionally killing the tarantula might be an overreaction even if it was reflex. But considering the context\u2014fear, prior warnings, and the sudden threat\u2014it could be argued the author wasn't at fault.\n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to contain the spider instead of killing it? However, in a moment of fear, reflex actions can be automatic. Also, the author had made their stance clear beforehand. The friend's pranking, even if accidental, led to the situation. So, perhaps the author isn't the asshole here. On the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it differently. Hmm.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the incident was caused by the jump scare from another person, the author had a valid fear, and they had a prior warning about pranks. The friend's reaction of calling them a \"pussy\" seems dismissive and not understanding of the phobia. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
