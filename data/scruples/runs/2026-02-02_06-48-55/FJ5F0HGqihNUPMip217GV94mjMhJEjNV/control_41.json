I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they accidentally killed their friend's tarantula because of a jump scare with a plate that made the spider fly their way. The author threw a book in reflex and killed it. The friend is upset, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, the author didn't like spiders and made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. The friend knew this. The jump scare was done by another friend, who took the plate cover off and jumped. The author reacted out of fear. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for killing the tarantula.\n\nOn one hand, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so it shouldn't have been possible for it to fly out. The friend might have been negligent by putting the spider in a microwave plate situation. Also, the other friend who did the jump scare might be at fault for pranking despite knowing the author's fear. But the author threw the book in fear, which led to the death. Was that a reasonable reaction? The author might not have intended to kill it, but the action was reflexive.\n\nHowever, even if it was reflexive, was there a responsibility to handle the situation differently? Like trying to catch the spider instead of throwing a book? But given the suddenness of the situation and the author's fear, maybe throwing the book was a natural reaction. Also, the friend had a history of pranking, which the author had warned against.\n\nBut tarantulas are generally not dangerous, so maybe the author overreacted. However, the friend's prank led directly to the incident, so maybe the blame should be on the friend and the other person for the prank. The author might be held responsible for the action, but the context of the prank and their fear could mitigate that.\n\nIn terms of ownership, the tarantula was the friend's, so the author might be liable if they acted recklessly. But given the circumstances, it's a bit of a grey area. The author's reaction was in fear, but the friend's prank was the catalyst. The question is about whether the author is the asshole. The friend's anger might be misplaced if the prank was the real issue. However, the author's action did result in the death, so there's some responsibility there. But considering the fear and the prank's role, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but it's a bit close. Alternatively, if the author should have handled it differently, maybe A. But the key is that the friend knew the author's fear and still allowed the prank to happen. So the main blame might be on the friend and the other person, not the author. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole, answer B.\n"
