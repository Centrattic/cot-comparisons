I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. So the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, the author is scared of spiders but okay with them in enclosures. The friend shows them off, but the author made it clear not to prank them because they might kill the spider. Then, while the friend is away, another friend does a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly toward the author, who then throws a book and kills it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had a fear of spiders, communicated that they wouldn't tolerate pranks, and the friend ignored that. The prank was done by the other friend, but the friend with the tarantulas is now angry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that they were scared, the prank was unexpected, and their reaction was a reflex. The friend and others are blaming the author. Legally, maybe not, since it was in self-defense? But morally, maybe they are responsible for the action. However, the prankster's action was the trigger. The author had a phobia and communicated that they would react strongly to pranks. The friend knew but allowed the prank to happen. \n\nSo maybe the friend is at fault for allowing the prank despite knowing the author's fear. The author's reaction was a reflex, not premeditated. The tarantula was harmed because of the prank. So the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to a fear they had made clear. Alternatively, maybe the author should have found another way to handle the fear instead of killing the spider. But given that it was a reflex action, it's not like they planned it. Also, the prank was the main issue here. \n\nSo the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted in a moment of fear they communicated, and the prank was the real mistake. The responsibility is on the friend who allowed the prank despite knowing the author's phobia.\n"
