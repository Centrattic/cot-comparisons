I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend has tarantulas, which is cool, but the author is really scared of spiders. They made it clear that they didn't want to be pranked because they might hurt the spider out of fear. The friend showed the spiders in their enclosures, which the author was okay with as long as they were secured. \n\nThen, when the friend wasn't there, the other friend did a jump scare with the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, in a panic, threw a book and killed the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are intent and provocation. The author had already communicated their fear and the risk of a prank. The other friend's jump scare was the immediate cause. The author acted in reflex, not intending to harm the spider. But the friend feels wronged because the spider was killed, and he knows the author's fear. \n\nBut wait, the tarantula was in an enclosure, right? The friend showed them as usual in their enclosures. The plate with the cover probably had the spider on it, maybe to show it or as part of the prank. If the spider wasn't supposed to be outside the enclosure, then maybe the other friend mishandled it. \n\nThe author's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a sudden threat, even if it was a prank. They didn't mean to kill it, but the situation was chaotic. However, the spider was part of the friend's collection, so there's a responsibility issue here. The author might be seen as overreacting, but given their phobia and the prank, maybe not entirely at fault.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. If he knew the author's fear, maybe he should have been more cautious. The other friend's prank was probably the real issue here. But the author ended up killing the spider, which the owner values. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the spider was mishandled by the other friend, then the blame might shift there. However, the author directly caused the death. But it was in self-defense due to a prank. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author is at fault for not handling it differently, while others might blame the prankster. \n\nIn the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) genre, usually, if someone acts in self-defense or extreme fear, even if it causes damage, they might not be the asshole. But if the situation could have been avoided, maybe they are. The author made it clear they didn't want pranks, so the prank was the catalyst. The author's action was reflexive, not premeditated. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they acted in fear due to a prank they explicitly said they didn't want. The responsibility also lies with the friend who pranked them. However, there's a debate here, but the core issue is the prank leading to a panic response.\n"
