I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation is that the friend showed off his tarantulas in their enclosures. The author made it clear that they hate spiders and wouldn't want to be pranked. Then, when the friend left, the other friend did a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author threw a book and killed the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a phobia of spiders and communicated that they wouldn't want to be pranked. The friend who owns the tarantula knows about this, but another friend caused the incident. The author acted in fear and reflex. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is responsible. The owner of the tarantula knew the author's fear but allowed another friend to set up a situation where the tarantula could be released. The other friend's prank led directly to the incident. \n\nSo, was the author justified in their reaction? Since they were in fear and the tarantula wasn't in an enclosure at the moment (because the plate was hit), maybe they felt threatened. However, the owner might argue that the tarantula was not supposed to be out, and the author destroyed it. But the author had previously warned not to prank them with spiders. \n\nI think the owner and the other friend share some responsibility for the situation. The author, despite their fear, did act in a way that destroyed someone else's pet. But considering the context of the prank and the author's phobia, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the tarantula was a pet, so killing it is a big deal. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the threat. If the tarantula was just flying towards them, and the author threw a book to protect themselves, maybe it's more about the owner's responsibility to secure the enclosure. But the owner allowed a prank that could lead to this outcome. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the incident was caused by the other friend's prank. But maybe there's a gray area. Some might say the author should have controlled their fear better, but others would side with their reflex action. The owner's friends might have contributed by doing the jump scare. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), the author isn't the asshole, because the situation was set up by the other friend's prank and the owner's negligence in securing the tarantula properly during the prank.\n"
