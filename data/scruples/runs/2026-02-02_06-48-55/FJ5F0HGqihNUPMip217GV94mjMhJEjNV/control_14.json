I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author killed their friend's tarantula. The friend has tarantulas and shows them off, but the author is scared of spiders. The friend knows this and the author told them never to prank them with the tarantulas. Then, during a game night, the friend's other friend jumps out with a plate, causing a tarantula to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear that they'd kill the spider if someone pranked them. The friend's other friend did a jump scare, which led to the accident. The tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the friend didn't secure it properly. The author acted in fear and self-defense. The friend's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author warned them. Also, the other people blaming the author might be missing the context of the prank. \n\nBut on the other hand, tarantulas are living creatures, and even if it was an accident, the author did kill the friend's property. The friend probably didn't want that. However, the prank initiated by the other friend might have been the real issue here. The author's reaction might be understandable given their fear. But maybe they should have handled it differently, like trying to catch the spider instead of killing it. The question is whether the author is the asshole for killing it, or if the friend and others are overreacting.\n\nSo, if the prank was the cause, then the other friend is at fault for initiating the jump scare. The author warned against pranks, so the other friend's action was the catalyst. The author's fear is valid, and their reaction was a reflex. The friend's anger might be misplaced because he should have respected the author's fear. However, the author did kill the spider, which is a significant action. But considering the circumstances, maybe they're not the asshole. The main issue is the prank, and the author's response was a result of that. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
