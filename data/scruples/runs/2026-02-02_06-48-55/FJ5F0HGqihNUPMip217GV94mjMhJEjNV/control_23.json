I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas, which the person dislikes. The friend shows the spiders in their enclosures, and the person makes it clear they don't want to be pranked because they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThen, during a PS4 session, the friend gets food, and another friend uses a plate with a cover to do a jump scare. The plate hits the enclosure, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. They made it clear they didn't want to be pranked with the spiders, so their warning was specific. The jump scare was initiated by another friend, not the tarantula owner. The tarantula was in its enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. The author acted in reflex, not premeditated. \n\nHowever, the tarantula was a pet, and killing someone's pet is generally frowned upon. The author's fear is valid, but was the action of throwing a book justified? They might argue self-defense against a perceived threat, but tarantulas are harmless. The friend's frustration is understandable because the pet was killed, even if accidentally. The other friend who did the prank might share responsibility for causing the incident.\n\nThe key points are: the author had a valid fear and warned about it, the prank led to the spider being thrown, and the author's reflex action resulted in the spider's death. The friend's anger might be about the loss of the pet, not just the action. The author might not be in the wrong if the prank was the catalyst, but there's a case that they should've handled it differently. However, since the tarantula was in an enclosure and the prank was the cause, it's a shared responsibility. But the author did kill the spider, which is a clear action. Maybe the answer is B (No) because the prank caused the situation, but A (Yes) because they killed the pet. Hmm, need to weigh these factors.\n"
