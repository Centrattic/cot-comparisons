I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about killing a friend's tarantula. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the person doesn't like spiders and has made their friend aware of this. The friend shows the tarantulas in their enclosures, which the person is okay with as long as they're secure. The friend knows not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. \n\nThen, during a PS4 session, the friend goes to get food. The other friend uses a plate cover to jump scare them, causing the tarantula to fly out. The author throws a book in reflex and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them.\n\nHmm, the key points here are pre-existing warnings. The author had clearly told the friend not to prank them with the spiders because of their fear. The friend in question did know this. However, the actual prank was executed by their other friend, not the tarantula owner. So the direct cause was an unexpected action by someone else. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. They had a legitimate fear and had communicated it. The tarantula was supposed to be secure, but the jump scare disrupted that. The author's reaction was a reflex to a sudden, scary situation. \n\nBut was the tarantula a threat? The owner says it's harmless. However, the author's fear is real and they had to act on instinct. The owner's friend pranked them, leading to the accident. The owner might feel responsible for the prankster's actions, but the author was trying to avoid the tarantula in the first place.\n\nOn one hand, the author killed the spider, which is a loss for the owner. On the other, the owner's friend set up a dangerous situation by using the spider in a prank, which the owner might be indirectly responsible for. The author had warned against such pranks. So the blame might be shared here. \n\nBut the author did kill the tarantula. Even if it was a reflex, they had to make a split-second decision. But considering the context, they had a fear they communicated, and the prank was unexpected. The owner might be in the wrong for allowing the prank, but the question is about the author. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because the prank was a factor. However, they did kill the spider. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. So the answer could be B (No). But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the prank was the other friend's idea, but the owner still has responsibility. Alternatively, the author's reaction was excessive. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that the author had a known fear and the prank was a setup. The owner knew not to prank them but allowed another friend to do so. So the owner is at least partially responsible. The author acted in fear, which they had warned about. So the answer is B, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
