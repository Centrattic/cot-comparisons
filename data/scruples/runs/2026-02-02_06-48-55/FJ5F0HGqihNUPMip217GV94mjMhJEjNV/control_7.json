I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas and knows the author hates spiders. The friend showed the tarantulas in their enclosures, and the author had made it clear they wouldn't tolerate any pranks involving them. Then, during a game session, the friend brings out food on a plate with a cover. Another friend takes the cover, jumps, and causes the plate to hit, sending the tarantula flying towards the author. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, the friend had a responsibility to keep the tarantula secure. The enclosures were supposed to prevent this. The author had warned against pranks, so the friend should have been more cautious. The other friend's jump scare was reckless. The author acted out of fear, which they had previously communicated. However, intentionally killing the tarantula, even in fear, might be seen as a wrong action. But considering the setup and the prank, the blame might be shared.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's negligence in securing the tarantula and the other friend's prank contributed to the incident. The author's reaction was a reflex, but the tarantula was in a dangerous situation because of others' actions. So, maybe the author isn't the sole wrongdoer. The answer might be B (No), as the fault isn't entirely theirs.\n"
