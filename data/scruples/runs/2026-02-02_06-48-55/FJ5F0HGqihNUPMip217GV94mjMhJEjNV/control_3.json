I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a tarantula getting killed during a game session. The author (OP) is terrified of spiders, even though the tarantula was in an enclosure. The friend had shown them before, and OP made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. Then, the other friend jumps out with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly out, and OP throws a book to kill it. Now the friend is angry, calling OP a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The tarantula was supposed to be in an enclosure. The friend knows OP is afraid, so maybe he should have been more careful. The other friend did a jump scare with the plate, which wasn't OP's doing. The immediate reaction was fear, leading to the book being thrown. \n\nBut the friend is upset because the tarantula was killed. The question is whether OP is at fault. The friend had a responsibility to keep the tarantula secure, especially knowing OP's fear. The jump scare was from the other friend, so maybe OP's reflex was understandable. However, OP did kill the tarantula, which is someone else's pet. Even if it was an accident due to fear, the action resulted in harm to the friend's property.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend pranked them despite knowing their fear, which might be partly their fault. But the responsibility for the tarantula's safety might lie with the friend who owns it. OP might not be entirely wrong, but maybe shares some blame. However, the friend's anger seems misplaced. The main issue is that OP acted in fear, but the consequences are still there. The other friend's prank likely caused the incident. So maybe OP isn't the main wrongdoer here. But since the tarantula died because of OP's action, even if it was reflexive, there's some responsibility. But considering the circumstances, maybe OP isn't the asshole. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
