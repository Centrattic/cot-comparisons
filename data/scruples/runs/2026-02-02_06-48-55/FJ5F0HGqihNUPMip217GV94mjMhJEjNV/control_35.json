I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about killing a friend's tarantula. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author's friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author hates spiders but is okay if they're secured. The friend knows this and the author even warns him not to prank them. Then, when the friend isn't there, the other friend jumps and hits a plate, causing the tarantula to fly toward the author. The author throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't like spiders and would kill one if scared. The friend knew this. The prank was done by the other friend, not the tarantula owner. The author acted in fear, which is a reflex. But the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the other friend's action was reckless. However, the author's reaction led to the death. \n\nBut the key points are: Did the author have a right to kill the spider in that situation? The friend's enclosure was supposed to keep it safe, but the prank disrupted that. The author's fear was a genuine reaction. However, the tarantula was not a threat, just a scared animal. So maybe the author overreacted. On the other hand, they were explicitly told not to prank the author, but the other friend did it anyway. The author's action was a reflex, not premeditated. \n\nBut legally and morally, killing someone's pet, even in fear, might be seen as wrong. The author should have tried to move away or call for help instead of killing. Also, the friend's anger is understandable because the author destroyed their pet. However, the prank might have been the real issue here. The answer might depend on whether the author's fear was a valid reason to kill the spider. \n\nIn some contexts, self-defense against an animal isn't applicable here since the spider wasn't attacking. The author's action was out of fear but not self-defense. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But others might argue the prank was the problem, and the author was provoked. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong because intentionally killing someone's pet, even in fear, is a problem. However, the prank was the catalyst. But since the spider was in an enclosure and the author had warned against pranks, the responsibility might be shared. But the author's action was the direct cause. So the answer is A.\n"
