I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was at a friend's house who has tarantulas. The friend showed them the spiders in their enclosures, and the author has made it clear that they hate spiders and would kill one if startled. The friend's other friend did a jump scare, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a panic, the author threw a book and killed the spider. Now, the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend had already secured the tarantulas in enclosures and the author was aware of this. The friend also knows the author's fear and had been told not to prank them. The jump scare was done by another friend, which was the trigger. The author acted out of fear and reflex. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so it shouldn't have been in a position to escape unless the enclosure wasn't secure. But the author killed it in self-defense sort of, due to fear. But maybe the author could have just stepped back or yelled instead of killing it. The friend's anger is understandable because tarantulas are expensive and maybe have sentimental value. Also, the author had previously warned about this reaction, so the friend might have been aware of the risk. The other friend's prank was reckless. However, the author did act impulsively. So, there's a mix here. The prankster is at fault for causing the incident, but the author's reaction led to the tarantula's death. But since the author had already communicated their fear, maybe the friend should have taken precautions. But the author still made the choice to throw the book. So, is it the author's fault? Maybe partially, but the prankster is also to blame. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they had a pre-existing aversion and communicated it, but still reacted in a way that destroyed someone else's property, perhaps the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong. But some might argue it's not their fault entirely. However, the author had control over their reaction. So, probably A.\n"
