I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The story goes like this: the author is invited over to play PS4. The friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author is told not to prank them because they hate spiders and might kill them if scared. Then, the friend brings a plate with a cover, and another friend takes the cover, jumps, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, in fear, throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling them a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author had previously communicated their fear and dislike of spiders, even specifying that a prank could lead to them killing the tarantula. The friend brought a plate with a tarantula in the enclosure. The other friend's jump scare caused the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author reacted by throwing a book, resulting in the spider's death.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, killing someone else's pet without consent is generally not acceptable. However, the situation here is more about consent and context. The tarantula was in an enclosure, so it wasn't supposed to be loose. The jump scare was initiated by another friend, not the friend who owns the tarantula. The author acted in a panic due to their fear, which they had communicated beforehand.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a phobia and took an action to protect themselves from a perceived threat, even if the threat was due to a prank. They had warned against pranks, so the other friend's action might be seen as reckless. The owner of the tarantula is upset, but the prankster might share some responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the tarantula was a pet, and intentionally harming it, even in a panic, could be seen as irresponsible. The author could have tried to move away or call for help instead of immediately killing it. However, in the heat of the moment, reflexes might not allow for such actions.\n\nThe key factors here are prior warnings, the prank's role in the incident, and the context of fear. The author made it clear that a prank could lead to this outcome, and the prank happened. The owner might be at fault for not preventing the prank, and the prankster for causing the incident. The author's action was a direct result of their fear, which they communicated, but still, the decision to kill the tarantula might be seen as excessive, even if understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had a legitimate fear, communicated it, and the situation was provoked by someone else's prank. However, the act of killing the tarantula could still be seen as the author's fault because they had the choice to react differently. But given the circumstances, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on how much responsibility is placed on the prankster versus the author. I think the author is not in the wrong because they acted in fear as a result of a prank they had warned against, and the owner's friend's actions contributed to the incident. So the answer would be B.\n"
