I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The story says that the friend has tarantulas, and the person doesn't like spiders. The friend shows them the spiders in their enclosures, and the author made it clear they don't want to be pranked because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, when the friend is away, the other friend does a jump scare with a plate that knocks the tarantula towards the author, who throws a book and kills it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and responsibility. The author had a phobia and told the friend not to prank them, which the friend seems to have ignored by letting the other friend do the jump scare. The jump scare was the direct cause of the spider flying towards the author. The author reacted out of fear with a reflex action. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author acted out of fear, which they had communicated beforehand. The prank was done by another friend, not the owner of the tarantula. However, the owner might argue that the author should have controlled their reaction better. But the owner knew the author's fear, and maybe should have made sure the environment was safe to prevent such an accident. Also, the tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author's action was a reflex, but they did kill the spider. However, the chain of events started with the prank. If the friend had prevented the jump scare, maybe the accident wouldn't have happened. But the author did kill the spider, even if it was in self-defense reaction. But since the spider was in an enclosure, maybe the enclosure wasn't secure enough. \n\nThe friend is upset because the author killed his pet. But the author had a legitimate fear and warned about it. The question is whether the author's reaction was reasonable. In some cases, people might argue that even with fear, you shouldn't kill someone else's pet. But others might say that the prank was the real issue here. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up, but the key is that the author acted in a reflex. However, since the spider was in an enclosure, perhaps the enclosure wasn't properly secured. But the jump scare was the direct cause. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it was an accident in response to a prank they warned about. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong because the spider was a pet, and they didn't handle it properly. \n\nThe friend and others are blaming the author, but the prank was initiated by the other friend. The owner might share some responsibility. But the author's action led to the spider's death. So in terms of direct responsibility, the author is the one who killed it, even if it was a reflex. But the context of the prank and the author's fear might mitigate that. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had communicated their fear and the prank was the catalyst. The responsibility might lie more with the friends who did the prank. However, technically, the author caused the death, so there's a case for them being in the wrong. It's a bit tricky. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer could be either, but the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks for the person whose actions created the problem. Here, the author did act on reflex, but the prank was the trigger. However, the author's action was the direct cause. So maybe they are in the wrong. But given the circumstances, perhaps not. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because the prank was the real issue, but others might disagree. I'll go with B, No.\n"
