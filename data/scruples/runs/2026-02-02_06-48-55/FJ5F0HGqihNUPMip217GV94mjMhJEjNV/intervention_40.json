I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a tarantula being killed during a PS4 game. So, the friend shows his tarantulas in enclosures, and the author is okay with that as long as they're secure. The friend knows the author hates spiders and even pranks people, so the author explicitly told him not to prank them.\n\nThen the friend brings out food with a plate that has a tarantula on it. The other friend takes the cover off and jumps, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author throws a book and kills the tarantula out of fear, and now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming him too.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author was warned not to be pranked, but the friend still set up a situation where the tarantula was not in its enclosure. Even though the other friend did the jump scare, the friend who owns the tarantula is responsible for how it was handled. The tarantula wasn't secured properly during the prank, which led to the accident.\n\nThe author's reaction was out of fear, which they had previously communicated. The friend's prank was reckless and didn't respect the author's boundaries. However, the author did take an action that resulted in the tarantula's death. But given the context, the main blame might lie with the friend who set up the prank and didn't ensure the tarantula was safely contained.\n\nStill, the author might be seen as in the wrong because they killed the tarantula, even if it was in self-defense. But considering the friend's actions were the root cause, maybe the author isn't the sole responsible. It's a bit of a gray area, but the friend's negligence in handling the tarantula during a prank is significant. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. Let me think again. The author had communicated their fear, the friend pranked them anyway, leading to the accident. The author's reflex action was a direct result of the prank. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
