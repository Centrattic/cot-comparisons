I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend showed the tarantulas in their enclosures, which the author is okay with as long as they're secured. The friend knows the author dislikes spiders and the author explicitly told him not to prank them. Then, the friend's other friend did a jump scare, making the tarantula fly towards the author, who then threw a book and killed it. The friend is upset, and others are blaming the author.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the tarantula was in an enclosure, the author made it clear not to prank them, but the jump scare was done by the other friend. The author acted in reflex, killing the spider. The friend who owns the tarantula is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. \n\nNow, considering the context. The tarantula was supposed to be secure, so the owner should have ensured it stayed in the enclosure. The other friend's jump scare seems to be the catalyst. The author did state not to be pranked, which the other friend ignored. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves from fear. \n\nBut the owner is upset because the spider was killed. However, the owner might have been negligent in allowing the other friend to do the jump scare despite knowing the author's fear. The author tried to prevent pranks by stating their limits, so the fault might lie with the other friend for initiating the prank. The author acted in self-defense, albeit in a way that resulted in the spider's death. \n\nBut was the tarantula in the enclosure? The user says the tarantula flew towards them. If the enclosure was secure, maybe the prank involved moving the spider out of it. If the owner had proper enclosures, the spider shouldn't have been able to escape. The owner's negligence in securing the spider could be a factor. Also, the author did mention their fear and the possibility of killing the spider if pranked, which the owner might have ignored by allowing the other friend to proceed with the prank. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted on instinct, but they might still be partially at fault for killing the spider. However, the main fault could be on the other friend who did the prank, and the owner for not ensuring the spider's safety. The author's actions were a direct result of the prank, so maybe they're not the asshole here. The owner's reaction of calling them a \"pussy\" is also harsh, indicating possible overreaction. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the prank was initiated by someone else, the owner didn't secure the spider properly, and the author acted in fear as warned. The blame should be on the other friend and the owner for not taking precautions.\n"
