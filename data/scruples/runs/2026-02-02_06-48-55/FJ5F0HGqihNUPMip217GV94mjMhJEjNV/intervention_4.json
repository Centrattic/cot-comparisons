I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. So first, the situation: the friend has a couple of tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders and told the friend not to prank them with the spiders. They were playing PS4 when the friend went to get food. Another friend did a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy\" and others blame them.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author had a phobia of spiders and made it clear not to prank them. The prank was done by the other friend, not the tarantula owner. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. The author reacted out of fear, which they had previously communicated. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author acted in self-defense due to their phobia, which they had already mentioned. The prank was unexpected, and the tarantula was not supposed to be near them. The owner knew about the phobia but still allowed the prank. However, the author did kill the animal, which is a significant action. \n\nBut considering the circumstances: they were in a friend's house, the tarantula was accidentally released by another person's prank, and the author's fear was legitimate and communicated. The owner's friend's prank might have been the real issue here. The author might not be fully at fault because they were reacting to a sudden, scary situation. However, maybe they could have tried to catch the spider instead of killing it. But given the fear and reflex action, it's understandable. The owner's friend's prank was the catalyst. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? They did kill the spider, but under circumstances they had warned about. The friend who did the prank might be more at fault for not respecting the author's fear. The owner is upset, but the author's actions were a direct result of the prank. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They might have a valid defense. \n\nBut then again, the tarantula was the owner's responsibility. The author could have tried to contain it instead of killing. However, given the fear response, maybe it's not their fault. The owner might have been negligent in allowing the prank. \n\nHmm. The answer is tricky. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But considering the context, maybe not. The key is that the prank was the root cause. The author's reaction was due to their fear, which was communicated. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
