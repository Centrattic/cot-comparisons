I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, and the author made it clear they don't want to be pranked with them because they'd likely kill one out of fear. Then, during a play session, the friend leaves to get food, and another friend covers the plate with the tarantula, leading to a jump scare that sends the spider flying. The author reflexively throws a book to kill it.\n\nNow, the question is about responsibility. The author had a phobia and communicated that they shouldn't be pranked with spiders. The other friend, not the main one, did the jump scare. So the main friend knew the risk but allowed another friend to set it up. The author's action was a reflex to avoid harm, but the main friend is upset, others are blaming the author, and another tarantula owner sent an angry message.\n\nKey points: Did the author act unreasonably? The tarantula was an enclosure, but the jump scare caused it to escape. The author's fear was communicated, so maybe they had a right to react. However, killing the tarantula might be excessive even if it was a reflex. The main friend's anger and others' blame suggest they expected the author to handle the situation without harming the spider. The author's action was based on fear, but was there a better way? Maybe trying to catch it instead. But if it's a reflex and the author can't control their fear, could they be blamed? Also, the other friend's prank was reckless. So the responsibility might be shared. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author had a prior warning and the friend knew, but still allowed the prank, maybe the main friend is at fault. However, the author's action directly resulted in the death. So maybe the answer is A (yes), because even with fear, they should have tried to avoid killing it. Or B (no), because the others provoked the situation. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The author's phobia is valid, but the method to deal with it might have been not acceptable. So the answer is A.\n"
