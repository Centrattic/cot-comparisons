I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author killed a friend's tarantula. The friend had shown the tarantulas, which were in their enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them being in the enclosure. The friend knows the author's fear and was warned not to prank them. Then, while the friend is getting food, another friend (or maybe the friend himself?) uses a plate cover to do a jump scare, causing the tarantula to fly toward the author. The author throws a book and kills the tarantula. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a justified fear of spiders and made that clear. The friend knew but still set up a situation that could trigger that fear. The jump scare was initiated by someone else (the other friend) using a plate cover. The author's reaction was a reflex to throw a book, which led to the spider's death. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, the author's fear was communicated, and the friend should have respected that. The prank was probably the friend's fault for not considering the author's phobia. However, the author did kill the tarantula. But was it intentional? The author acted out of reflex, not malice. The friend's responsibility might be in creating the situation that led to the spider being thrown. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to avoid killing the spider, even if it was a reflex. Alternatively, since the spider was thrown at them, the immediate reaction is understandable. The key here is whether the author had a duty to protect the spider despite their fear. If the author made it clear that they would kill the spider if pranked, then maybe the friend should bear some responsibility for the prank. \n\nAlso, considering that the spider was in an enclosure before the prank. The friend might have taken it out for the prank, which was against the author's wishes. If the spider was outside the enclosure, then the friend is at fault for not keeping it secure. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The friend's prank was the catalyst. The author's action was a reflex, but they might still be held responsible for the death. However, given the context of the prank and the author's prior warning, the author's actions could be seen as a reaction to a provocation. The friend and the other friend who did the jump scare are probably more at fault. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted in a moment of fear as they warned. But some might argue that they should have found another way to handle the situation, like trying to move the spider instead of killing it. \n\nHmm, it's a bit tricky. If the answer is B (Not in the wrong), it's because the author was provoked and acted in fear as they had communicated. If A (in the wrong), maybe because they killed the spider, regardless of the circumstances. But considering the context, I think the answer is B. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
