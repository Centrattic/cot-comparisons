I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. So, the situation is: the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author is okay with them as long as they're secured. The friend knows the author hates spiders and pranks people, so the author warned him not to prank them. Then, when the friend leaves, another friend does a jump scare with a plate that drops the tarantula. The author throws a book and kills it. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The friend showed the tarantula in enclosures, which the author was okay with. The author had warned the friend not to prank him with spiders. The prank came from the other friend, not the tarantula owner. The author acted out of fear reflexively. The key points here are intent and responsibility. The author didn't intentionally want to prank or harm the spider; it was a reflex. However, the tarantula owner might feel wronged because the spider was their property and the action was taken without their consent. \n\nBut the prank was initiated by the third party. The author's friend didn't set the prank; it was the other friend. So the author wasn't directly responsible for the prank. However, the author did kill the spider. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue self-defense or fear. On the other hand, the spider was not a threat, just dropped accidentally. The owner might see it as destruction of property. But the author was warned not to prank, and the prank came from elsewhere. The author's action was a reaction to a sudden, scary situation. \n\nAlso, the friend's anger seems to be not just about the spider but maybe about the author's fear or their own responsibility in keeping the spider secure. If the enclosures are secure, maybe the tarantula shouldn't have been able to escape, so the owner might be at fault for not making the enclosure safer. But the owner might not have expected a jump scare to cause that. \n\nOthers are blaming the author, but the author's action was a reflex. The author tried to warn against pranks, but the prank happened anyway. In this case, the author might not be the asshole because they didn't intend to harm the spider and were acting on fear. However, taking responsibility for the spider's death is important. Maybe the author should have tried to catch it instead of killing it, but given the fear response, it's understandable. \n\nOn the other side, the friend might have a right to be upset about losing the spider, but the author isn't entirely to blame since the prank was the catalyst. So, the answer might be B (No, author isn't in the wrong) because the author's action was a reflex, not intentional, and the prank was the other friend's fault. However, there's a nuance here about responsibility for the spider's safety. If the enclosures were secure, the owner might be at fault for not making them more secure. But the author isn't the one who caused the tarantula to fly out. The main issue is the author's reaction. If the author had a legitimate fear and acted in a reflex, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the spider was in a secure enclosure, the owner should have known better. Hmm.\n\nWait, the owner showed the tarantula in enclosures, but the other friend's prank caused it to fly out. So the owner might have been negligent in securing it properly if the enclosure wasn't safe from pranks. But the author was warned not to prank, and the owner did know the author's fear. The other friend did the prank, so the owner might not have been responsible for that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a reflex, not malicious. The owner's anger might stem from the author's fear being triggered by the prank. The author isn't the one who caused the prank. So, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted out of fear and the prank was initiated by another person.\n"
