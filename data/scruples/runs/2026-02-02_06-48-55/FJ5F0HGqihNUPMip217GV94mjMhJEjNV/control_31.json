He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, and the author really dislikes spiders. The friend knows this and was supposed to keep them in enclosures. The friend went to get food, and while he was away, the other friend messed with the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, in a panic, threw a book and killed the tarantula.\n\nFirst, the friend had already been warned not to prank the author about the spiders because the author might kill them out of fear. So the friend knew the risk involved. The pranking friend used a plate with a cover, which sounds like it wasn't supposed to happen. The key points here are pre-existing knowledge of the fear, the pranking action leading to the incident, and the author's reflex reaction.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were afraid and reacted instinctively. But the friend had already agreed not to do anything to provoke that reaction. The other friend's prank was the direct cause of the tarantula flying. The author might be responsible for not anticipating the prank, but the friend who pranked might be equally or more at fault for violating the prior agreement. However, the author's action led to the death of the tarantula, which is a significant thing to consider, especially if the friend valued the animal. The author might not be the sole person in the wrong, but the question is specifically about the author. The friend's anger might be justified if the author broke an agreement, but the prankster's actions were reckless. The author could have tried to catch the spider instead of killing it. But given the fear and the reflex, maybe it's a split. However, the community often looks at intentions and prior agreements. Since the author made it clear they wouldn't tolerate pranks, but still ended up reacting, maybe they share some responsibility. But the prankster definitely broke the trust. So, is the author the asshole? Hmm. In AITA scenarios, people often consider if the person acted unreasonably. The author's fear is valid, but the action of killing the spider without trying to prevent it might be seen as overreacting, even if it was a reflex. The fact that others are blaming the author, including another tarantula owner, suggests that the community might not support the action. But the prank was the catalyst. So maybe it's a 50/50, but the author is partially at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they had prior warnings and still reacted in a way that killed the animal, maybe they are not entirely in the wrong. But the friend's anger is due to the author's action. Alternatively, the prankster's fault is more to blame. In AITA terms, the answer is usually a clear A or B. If the author was provoked by the prank, but their action was the direct cause, perhaps they are not the asshole. Wait, the author's action was a reflex to kill the spider when it flew towards them. If the friend knew the author's fear and still pranked them, that's their fault. But the author's decision to kill it might be seen as overstepping if the spider was harmless and the author could have tried to catch it. However, in a panic, that might not be feasible. The community's reaction might be more about the death of the animal. So, considering all, the author might not be in the wrong because the prank was the cause, and the author acted out of fear. But if the author had previously stated they wouldn't kill the spider if it was secure, maybe the prank was the problem. The answer could be B (No), but I need to check if the author's action was justified. Since they made it clear they would kill it if pranked, and the prank happened, the author's action might be seen as a consequence of the prankster's mistake. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
