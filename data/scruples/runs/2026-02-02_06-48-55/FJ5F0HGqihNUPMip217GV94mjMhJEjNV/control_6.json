I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas, which he shows in enclosures. The author is afraid of spiders but okay with them in their enclosures. The friend knows about this fear and is warned not to prank them. However, another friend jumps and causes the plate with the tarantula to fly towards the author, who then throws a book and kills it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the friend's knowledge of the author's fear. The friend had been warned not to prank them, yet he still set up a situation where the tarantula could be disturbed. The other friend's jump scare directly led to the incident. The author acted out of fear and reflex, which is understandable given their phobia.\n\nThe author did kill the tarantula, but the context is important. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but due to the prank, it was released. The author's reaction was a direct result of the prank. Since the friend knew about the fear and still allowed the prank to happen, perhaps the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. The other friend's actions initiated the incident. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which might make some say they're at fault.\n\nBut considering the circumstances, the author's fear was a valid reason for their reaction. The friend's negligence in allowing the prank despite knowing the author's fear plays a role. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were provoked and acted in panic. However, the act of killing the animal is a point against them. But given the context of the prank and the friend's prior knowledge, the author's actions could be seen as a justified reaction to a scary situation.\n"
