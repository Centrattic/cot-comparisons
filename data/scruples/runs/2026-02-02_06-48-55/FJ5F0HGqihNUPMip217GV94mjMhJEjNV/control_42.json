I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. So the situation is that the friend showed off his tarantulas in enclosures, the author doesn't like spiders but is okay if they're contained. The friend knows the author's fear and warned him not to prank him, which would make the author react. Then, while the friend is getting food, another friend does a jump scare with a plate that knocks the tarantula into the author's direction. The author throws a book, killing the spider. The friend is upset, others blame him, and even someone else with tarantulas is angry. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author had a justified fear, communicated it to the friend who owns the tarantulas. The friend knew not to prank him, but the other friend did a jump scare that caused the incident. The author acted out of reflex, not malice. However, the tarantula was a pet, which some people care deeply about. \n\nSo the main issue is whether the author's action of killing the tarantula was justified. The friend's friend's prank caused the tarantula to be thrown towards the author. The author tried to protect himself. The question is if the author is responsible for the tarantula's death. \n\nOn one hand, the author clearly stated his fear and the friend knew not to prank him. The prank was done by another person, not the owner. The owner might be at fault for not stopping the prank. On the other hand, tarantulas are pets, and their death is significant to their owners. The author's action was impulsive, but under the circumstances, maybe understandable. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility: if the tarantula was in an enclosure, maybe the setup wasn't secure enough. However, the prank caused the accident. The author might argue that the prank led to the situation. However, he did kill the tarantula. If the owner is upset because the tarantula was a valued pet, the author might be seen as responsible for its death, even if it was a reflex. \n\nBut then, the author made it clear that if the friend pranked him, he would kill the spider. The other friend did the prank, not the owner. The owner's responsibility is in allowing the prank to happen. The author tried to protect himself. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the owner knew the author's fear and still allowed others to prank him, maybe the owner is at fault. However, others are blaming the author. The question is whether the author is the asshole. \n\nThe key here is whether the author acted in self-defense or caused unnecessary harm. Since the tarantula was a pet, but the situation was caused by a prank, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which others value. Even if it was a reflex, the action was taken. The friend's anger might be reasonable, but the author's fear was communicated. Maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nBut in terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author acted in fear, the prank caused the incident, but he did kill the tarantula, which others value. The community might split. However, in similar situations, sometimes people are seen as responsible for their own fears leading to harm, even if it's unintentional. Alternatively, if the prank was the root cause, maybe the pranks are to blame. \n\nIn the original AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, the community often considers intentions and circumstances. The author's intention was to protect himself from a fear. The prank was done by another person. The author communicated his fear. So maybe the author isn't the asshole. But the tarantula was a pet, so perhaps there's a responsibility to avoid killing it. \n\nBut the tarantula was thrown at him due to a prank, so maybe it's an accident. The author's action was a reflex. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But some people might argue that he should have found a different way to protect himself. However, the situation was a reflex action. Therefore, the answer could be B.\n"
