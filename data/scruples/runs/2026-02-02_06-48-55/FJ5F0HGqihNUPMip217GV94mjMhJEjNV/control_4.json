I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. \n\nFirst, the setup: the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author hates spiders but is okay if they're contained. The friend knows this and is told not to prank them. However, during a PS4 session, when the friend is away, another friend uses a plate cover to jump scare the author. The tarantula is hit and flies towards the author, who throws a book and kills it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The friend who owns the tarantula is aware of the author's fear and the warning to not prank them. But the jump scare was initiated by the other friend, using the plate with the tarantula. The owner was away getting food. The author, scared, reacted with a book, resulting in the tarantula's death.\n\nLegally, the owner's friend might be at fault for the prank. The author did kill the animal, but under extreme fear. However, the owner of the tarantula is upset. The author's justification is self-defense against a sudden, scary situation. But tarantulas are kept in enclosures; if the owner had followed proper care, they should have been secure. The prank might have compromised the enclosure's safety, leading to the incident. \n\nEthically, is the author wrong? They acted on fear, but they did kill the tarantula. However, the prank was the catalyst. The owner's friend is responsible for the prank, but the owner is now angry. The author might be considered partially at fault because they threw the book, but it was in response to a provocation. The owner had been warned about pranks, yet allowed the other friend to do it. So maybe the owner and the other friend are more at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is the asshole. The author might be seen as overreacting, but the prank was the main issue. The community might split here. The answer could be B (not the asshole) because the prank led to the incident, and the author acted in fear. The owner's responsibility is to secure the tarantula properly, even during social gatherings. The prank was reckless. So the author's action, while resulting in harm, was a reaction to a dangerous situation they were warned to avoid. Hence, B.\n"
