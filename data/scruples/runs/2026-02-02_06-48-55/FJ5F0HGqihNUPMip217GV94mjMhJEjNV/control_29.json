I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about killing a friend's tarantula. So, the friend has tarantulas, the author is afraid of spiders but okay with them in enclosures. The friend knows this and said he never wants to prank the author because of it. Then another friend jumps with a plate that has a tarantula on it, causing it to fly towards the author, who throws a book in reflex and kills it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who is responsible. The author made it clear they don't want to be pranked, and the friend who did the prank is the one who actually caused the spider to move. The author acted in fear, which they had warned about. The tarantula was supposed to be in an enclosure, which is safe. The prankster's action led the spider to be out of the enclosure, putting others in danger. The author's friend is upset, but the prankster is the one who broke the safe handling of the spider.\n\nSo, the author is not intentionally harming the tarantula. They followed the friend's warning and just reacted. The real fault is with the person who pranked them, despite the author's clear boundaries. The author might have a responsibility to protect the spider, but the prankster's action was reckless. The author is probably not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
