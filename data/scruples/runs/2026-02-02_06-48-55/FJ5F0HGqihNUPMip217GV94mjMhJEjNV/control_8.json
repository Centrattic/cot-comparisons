I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for killing their friend's tarantula. So, the situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but was okay with them being contained. They warned the friend not to prank them, because they might kill it out of fear. The friend went to get food, and another friend did a jump scare with a covered plate. The plate hit the ground, the tarantula flew towards the author, who threw a book reflexively and killed it.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend had the tarantula in an enclosure, so they were secure. The author had made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. However, the other friend caused the accident. The author acted in a reflex to avoid the spider. The friend is upset, others blame the author, and even someone else with tarantulas is angry.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider intent. The author didn't mean to kill the spider on purpose. It was a reflex action to a sudden, scary event. They had previously warned about their fear. But also, maybe they should have handled it differently. For example, trying to avoid the spider instead of using a book. However, in the moment, panic reactions are hard to control. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend who pranked them is at least partially responsible for causing the situation. If the other friend hadn't done the jump scare, the spider wouldn't have been loose. The author was in a stressful situation where their fear was triggered. But the enclosures were supposed to keep the spiders safe. Maybe the friend should have ensured that the food wasn't going to knock over the enclosures. \n\nAlso, the author had warned the friend not to prank them, so the friend should have known better. The author's action was a result of a prank that put the spider in danger. The other friend's jump scare was the catalyst. So, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. However, the author did destroy the enclosure's safety by throwing the book. \n\nBut considering all that, the main issue is that the tarantula was supposed to be in the enclosure. If the plate was covered and the spider escaped, maybe the enclosure wasn't secure enough. The pranking friend's actions led to the accident. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author did kill the spider, but it was an accident. They had a valid fear, communicated it, and acted in a moment of panic. The pranking friend's action is a key factor here. So, is the author the asshole? Maybe not entirely, but there's some responsibility. However, given the circumstances, the pranking friend's negligence is a bigger issue. The author's action was a reflex. So, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
