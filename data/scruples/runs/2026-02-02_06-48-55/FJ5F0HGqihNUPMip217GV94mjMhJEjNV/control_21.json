I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author hates spiders and told the friend not to prank them. The friend's other friend did a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula on it, causing the spider to fly towards the author. The author then threw a book and killed it. Now the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. The friend who owns the tarantula knew about the author's fear but still allowed another friend to do the jump scare. The jump scaring friend might be at fault for provoking the situation. The author acted out of fear and reflex, which could be seen as self-preservation. However, the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe it shouldn't have been out. The owner is responsible for the tarantula's safety. The author's action was a reaction to a sudden threat, even if it was a prank. So, the blame might not lie entirely with the author. The friend who did the prank and the owner might share responsibility. The author might not be the asshole here, but the situation is a bit murky. Considering all factors, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
