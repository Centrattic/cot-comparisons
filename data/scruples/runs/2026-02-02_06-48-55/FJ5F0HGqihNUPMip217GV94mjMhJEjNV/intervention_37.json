I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas, which the author really dislikes. The friend showed the spiders in their enclosures, knowing the author's fear but respecting the author's boundaries by keeping them secured. The author made it clear not to prank them because it might lead to the author killing the spider.\n\nThen, when the friend leaves to get food, another friend jumps scare with a plate that accidentally causes the tarantula to fly towards the author. The author, in fear, throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a legitimate fear of spiders, which they communicated. The friend knew this but still brought a tarantula into a situation where a prank could occur. The prank was initiated by the other friend, not the tarantula owner. The author acted in self-defense, albeit with a book, which resulted in the spider's death. However, the spider was inside an enclosure, so the friend was responsible for keeping it secure. The accident was caused by someone else's prank, not the friend's negligence. \n\nThe key points here are: the author communicated their fear, the spider was in an enclosure, the accidental release was due to a prank by another person, and the author's reaction was a reflex to a sudden, scary situation. However, the author did kill the spider, which is a pet to the friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite these circumstances.\n\nSome might argue that the author should have tried to contain the spider instead of killing it, but given the fear and the suddenness of the situation, the reflex action is understandable. On the other hand, the friend had a responsibility to prevent such a scenario by not allowing pranks that could lead to accidents. The fact that the spider was in an enclosure suggests the friend wasn't careless, but the prank by another person was the root cause. The author's actions were a direct reaction to a perceived threat, even if the threat wasn't immediate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend might have failed to ensure the spider's safety during social gatherings where pranks are common. The author's communication of their fear was appropriate, and the other friend's prank was the catalyst. However, the author's decision to kill the spider, even in fear, might be seen as the immediate cause. However, considering the circumstances, it's a gray area. The author might not be entirely at fault as it was an accident caused by others' actions. But since they are the one who physically killed the spider, some blame could be placed on them. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's actions were justified given their fear and the circumstances. The friend's pranks and the other friend's actions contributed to the situation, but the author's reaction is what directly caused the death. However, the author's fear was valid and communicated, so maybe they're not entirely at fault. But since they ended up killing the pet, they might be considered at fault. Alternatively, the friend who allowed pranks and didn't secure the spider properly might share the blame. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's fear was legitimate and they communicated it, the action of killing the spider was their direct choice. However, considering the context of being startled and the friend's known pranks, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and they physically killed the spider, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the prank was the main cause, maybe B (No). I need to decide based on the typical AITA logic. Usually, if someone's actions directly caused harm, even in fear, they might be considered at fault. However, the context of clear warnings and an accident might mitigate that. Hmm.\n"
