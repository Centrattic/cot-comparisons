I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The person doesn't like spiders but is okay with them in their enclosures. They warned the friend not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. Then, during a PS4 session, the friend brings a plate with a tarantula on it covered, but the other friend jumps and hits the plate, causing the tarantula to fly toward the author. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider. Now the friend is angry, calling them a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, consider the author's actions. They were in a situation they found scary. They had a prior warning about not being pranked, which the friend might have ignored if he brought the tarantula out. The other friend's jump scare was unexpected. The author's reaction was a reflex to self-defense or fear. But they did kill the tarantula, which is someone else's pet.\n\nThe friend had the tarantula in an enclosure, but here it was on a plate. Was that part of a prank? The author had warned against pranks. The friend might be at fault for not securing the tarantula properly, leading to the accident. However, the author could have reacted differently. Instead of throwing a book, maybe they could have yelled for help or tried to contain the spider. The fact that they killed it on reflex might be understandable, but it's still an action that destroyed someone's property. \n\nOthers are blaming the author, but the situation is a bit of a chain of events. The other friend's jump scare (which might have been intentional) caused the accident. If the friend brought the tarantula out despite knowing the author's fear, that's a problem. Also, the tarantula was supposed to be in an enclosure, not on a plate. The author might not be entirely to blame because it was a reflex action, but they did take responsibility by asking if they're the asshole. However, intentionally killing someone's pet, even in fear, is a strong action. The author's prior warning suggests they knew the risk, but the friend might have set them up. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid fear and the situation was chaotic, the fact remains that they destroyed someone's pet. The friend and the other friend also share responsibility. But the author's action led to the tarantula's death, so they might be in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the context is considered, but some might say A. I think it's B because the author acted in fear reflexively, and the setup by others contributed. So the answer is B.\n"
