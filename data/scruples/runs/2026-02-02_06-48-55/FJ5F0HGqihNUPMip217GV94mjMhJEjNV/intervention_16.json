I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author dislikes spiders but is okay as long as they're secured. The friend knows this and the author even told them not to prank them with the spiders. Then, another friend uses a plate with a cover that hits the enclosure, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In a reflex, the author throws a book and kills it. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the setup of the situation. The tarantula was in an enclosure, which is supposed to be secure. The friend who owns the tarantula showed them as usual, which implies they were in their proper containers. The author had made it clear not to prank them with the spiders, which they respected. However, the other friend's action with the plate caused the accident. \n\nThe author's action was a reflex, not a deliberate act. They were scared and threw a book to protect themselves. But since the tarantula was in an enclosure, maybe the setup wasn't secure enough? Or perhaps the other friend's prank was reckless. The owner of the tarantula might be responsible for ensuring the enclosures are safe from such incidents. However, the author's immediate reaction might be understandable given their fear. \n\nBut legally and morally, killing someone's pet, even in fear, could be seen as negligence. The author knew the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe they had a duty to avoid harming it. However, the situation was caused by another person's prank, which the author couldn't have controlled. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author reasonably believed there was a threat, self-defense could be a point. But since it's a pet, the owner might have expected that the author wouldn't intentionally harm it. \n\nThe friend's reaction of calling the author a \"pussy\" is unhelpful, but the author's action was out of fear. The other friend's prank was the catalyst. So, is the author in the wrong? If the enclosures were secure, then the prank was the fault of the other friend. But the author's reflexive action might be seen as acceptable in the heat of the moment. However, killing an animal, even accidentally, might be considered wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had a right to defend themselves from a perceived threat. Since it's a tarantula, which isn't dangerous, maybe not. But the author's fear was genuine. The other friend's prank was the main issue here. The author might not be entirely at fault. However, the owner's tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the author should have trusted that it was safe. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they killed the tarantula in a panic, even if it was a reflex. Alternatively, B, not the author's fault because the prank was reckless. Hmm. I'm a bit torn but leaning towards A because the tarantula was in a container, so the author's action might be seen as unnecessary once the owner ensured it was secure. Maybe the other friend is at fault, but the question is about the author's responsibility. So answer A for yes.\n"
