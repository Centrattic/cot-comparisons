I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend has tarantulas, which the author dislikes but tolerates as long as they're in their enclosures. The friend knows the author's fear and was told not to prank them. However, during a game session, the friend gets food with a plate that has a tarantula on it. The other friend jumps, causing the plate to be hit, and the tarantula flies towards the author. In a panic, the author throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend with the tarantula knew the author's fear and had a history of pranks. The other friend's jump scare was intentional, using a plate that had the tarantula, leading to the accident. The author acted out of fear and reflex.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The friend who owns the tarantula is responsible for keeping it securely in its enclosure. If the setup was such that the tarantula could escape, maybe the owner didn't secure it properly. But the story says the tarantula was on a plate with a cover, which the other friend removed. So maybe the owner placed the tarantula on a plate that wasn't secure, knowing someone might jump, leading to an accident.\n\nThe other friend's prank was the direct cause. The author was warned not to be pranked and didn't want to be around the spiders. The owner's pranks could have been the initial issue. The author acted in a reflexive fear response, which might be understandable given the warning they gave.\n\nBut legally, if the tarantula was in the owner's care and the other friend's actions caused the accident, maybe the owner is liable for not preventing it. However, morally, the author might be seen as overreacting if they intentionally killed the spider. However, they threw a book in reflex, not premeditated.\n\nThe owner is upset and others blame the author. The author's actions were a reaction to fear, but the responsibility for the tarantula's safety lies with the owner. The owner might have set up a situation where the tarantula could be harmed, especially knowing the author's fear.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the situation was caused by others' actions. The owner's pranks and the other friend's jump scare led to the accident. The author acted in self-defense against their fear, and the owner should have ensured the tarantula's safety.\n"
