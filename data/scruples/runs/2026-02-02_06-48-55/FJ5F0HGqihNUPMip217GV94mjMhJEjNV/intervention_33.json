I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author killing a friend's tarantula during a game night. \n\nFirst, the friend had tarantulas in their enclosures, which the author was okay with as long as they were contained. The friend is known for pranks, so the author clearly said not to prank them. The friend left to get food, and when they returned, another friend took off the plate's cover, causing a jump scare. The plate hit, and the tarantula flew toward the author, who then threw a book to kill it.\n\nNow, the question is about who's at fault. The author claims self-defense, reacting to a sudden fear. But the friend and others are upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them. The key points are: the author's prior dislike of spiders, the warning against pranks, the unexpected action by the other friend, and the reflex action leading to the spider's death.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction was justified. The author had a phobia, made their fear clear, and the situation was a prank that the friend had previously done. The plate being hit was an accident by the other friend, not the main friend's intention. The author's action was a reflex, not a premeditated act. However, the friend might feel betrayed because the tarantula was a pet, and the author didn't try to contain it but killed it immediately. The other people's reactions also play a role\u2014maybe they expected the author to handle it differently, like catching the spider rather than killing it.\n\nBut the author was under stress and fear, which can lead to reflexive actions. The friend's pranks might have contributed to the situation. The author did warn against pranks, but the other friend's jump scare wasn't the main friend's doing. The main friend might be upset because the spider was destroyed, but the author's actions were a reaction to a sudden threat. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author had a phobia and a warning was given, but on the other, the tarantula was a pet. However, the circumstances were chaotic, and the author's reaction was a reflex. The friend might be at fault for allowing the prank, even if unintentional. The author's action might be seen as a result of fear, not malice. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if the author's action was reasonable. Throwing a book to kill the spider might be excessive if the spider was just near them. Maybe the author could have stepped back or tried to move it instead. But given the fear and the sudden movement, perhaps it's understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes people are called out for not handling the situation calmly, even if they're scared. However, if the tarantula was a threat, but in reality, they're generally harmless. So the author's fear might be irrational, but they do have a phobia. The friend might be upset not just about the spider's death but also about the author's reaction. The other friend's prank might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was a reflex due to fear, which they had communicated. The main friend's pranks and the other friend's involvement might contribute to the problem. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
