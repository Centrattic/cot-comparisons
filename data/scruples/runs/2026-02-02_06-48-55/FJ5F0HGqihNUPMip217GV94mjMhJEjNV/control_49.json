I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is that they killed their friend's tarantula during a jump scare. The writer says they hate spiders and made their friend aware not to prank them because they might kill the tarantula in fear. The friend's action caused the tarantula to fly towards them, and they threw a book, killing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend knew the writer was afraid of spiders and had warned them not to prank. However, the friend still did a jump scare with the plate, which led to the accident. The writer acted on reflex to protect themselves from fear. \n\nThe key points here are intent and responsibility. The writer didn't intend to kill the tarantula; it was a reflex action. The real issue might be the friend's prank, which led to the accident. However, the writer had already stated their fear and boundaries. If the friend knew the consequences and still did it, maybe the friend is at fault. But the writer's action resulted in the death of the tarantula. \n\nNow, considering the aftermath, the friend and others are blaming the writer. The writer's defense is that they were scared and acted instinctively. The question is whether the writer is responsible despite the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, sometimes people are held accountable for actions even if it's a reflex if they could have controlled it. However, in this case, the writer made their stance clear and the action was a direct result of the friend's prank. So maybe the writer isn't the asshole here because they were protecting themselves from a fear they've communicated. \n\nOn the other hand, tarantulas are pets, and someone else's property. Even if the friend was at fault, the writer might still be responsible for the death of the animal. But the writer didn't act out of malice. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the writer made their fear known and the action was a reflex due to the prank. The friend's prank was the catalyst. However, there's a counterargument that they should have found another way to protect themselves without killing the pet. But given the circumstances, the writer's action was impulsive and not premeditated. So I'd say B.\n"
