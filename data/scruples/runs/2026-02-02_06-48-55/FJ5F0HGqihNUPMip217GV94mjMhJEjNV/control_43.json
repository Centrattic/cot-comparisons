I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's tarantula being killed during a jump scare.\n\nSo, the author of the story is someone who really dislikes spiders. They were at their friend's house, and the friend has tarantulas that are kept in enclosures. The author made it clear they didn't want the friend to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear. \n\nThen, the friend went to get food, and another friend did a jump scare by taking off the plate cover. The tarantula flew towards the author, who threw a book in reflex and killed it. Now, the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy,\" and others are blaming them too. \n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are intent, premeditation, and context.\n\nFirst, the author had a phobia of spiders and communicated their fear. The friend knew this and was supposed to avoid pranks. However, the jump scare was done by another friend, not the one who owns the tarantula. The owner might still be responsible for ensuring the environment is safe, especially since they knew the author's dislike.\n\nThe author reacted in a panic. They didn't mean to kill the tarantula but acted on instinct. The jump scare was unexpected, and the tarantula was thrown towards them. It's possible the author didn't have a choice but to react quickly. \n\nOn the other hand, the tarantula's owner could be at fault for not securing the enclosure properly. If the spider was supposed to be in a secure enclosure, then the jump scare caused it to escape. The owner might be responsible for not preventing the accident. \n\nThe author's action was a reflex, not premeditated. They didn't go out of their way to harm the tarantula; it was a direct result of the jump scare. The people blaming them might not consider the fear they have, which they had already communicated. \n\nHowever, killing an animal, even in fear, might not be justified. But given the circumstances\u2014unexpected, fear-induced reaction\u2014it could be seen as an accident. The owner's responsibility to keep the tarantula secure is also a factor. If the enclosure wasn't secure, the owner is partly to blame.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They acted in self-defense, given their phobia, and the owner should have ensured the tarantula couldn't be harmed during such pranks. The other friend's prank was reckless, leading to the accident. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
