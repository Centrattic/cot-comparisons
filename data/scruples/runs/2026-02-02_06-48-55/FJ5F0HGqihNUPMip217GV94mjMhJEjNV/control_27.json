I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author hates spiders but is okay if they're contained. The friend knows this and was told not to prank them. Then, during a PS4 game, the friend brings out food with a plate that has a tarantula inside. Another friend takes the cover and jumps, making the tarantula fly towards the author. The author throws a book and kills it. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. The friend had enclosures, but in this case, the tarantula was on a plate with a cover? That seems like it's not in its usual enclosure. The friend might have been pranking them, even though he was told not to. The other friend helped by doing a jump scare. The author's reaction was a reflex to protect themselves.\n\nBut was the tarantula actually a threat? They're in a plate, maybe not dangerous if it's a species that's not harmful. The author admitted they dislike spiders, but killed it out of fear. The friend's reaction is anger, others are blaming them. \n\nLegally, if the tarantula was someone's property, destroying it could be an issue. But morally? The author was trying to protect themselves from fear. However, the friend might have had a right to be upset if the tarantula was handled properly and the author acted in fear. \n\nThe friend did set up a situation that could lead to a tarantula being thrown, even if unintentionally. The other friend's jump scare contributed. The author's reaction was a reflex. So maybe the friend and the other friend are partially at fault for the setup. But the author still killed someone's pet, even if it was a tarantula. \n\nBut the friend had been warned about pranks. Maybe the friend is partly responsible for not keeping the tarantula secure. The author might not be entirely wrong. But the act of killing the tarantula was intentional, even if it was a reflex. So is it the author's fault?\n\nAlternatively, the author's fear is valid, and the friend's prank-like setup was the real issue. The answer might depend on whose actions were more at fault. The friend's prank and the other friend's jump scare led to the incident. The author's action was a direct result of that setup. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nBut the tarantula was property, and the author destroyed it. However, given the circumstances, it might be seen as self-defense against fear. The friend's responsibility to keep the tarantula secure is important here. If the tarantula wasn't in a proper enclosure during the incident, the friend might have been negligent. \n\nSo, putting it all together. The author's actions were a reflex due to fear, caused by a prank setup. The friend's setup and negligence contributed. The author might not be entirely wrong. The answer could be B (not the asshole).\n"
