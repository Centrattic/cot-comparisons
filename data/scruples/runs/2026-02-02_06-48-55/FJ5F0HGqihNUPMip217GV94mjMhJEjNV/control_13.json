I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, which the author really dislikes. The friend shows them in their enclosures, and the author made it clear they don't want to be pranked because they might react by killing the spider. Then, during a game session, the friend brings food with a plate that has a tarantula on it. The other friend jumps and hits the plate, causing the spider to fly towards the author. The author throws a book in reflex and kills the spider. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing a harmless animal. Others are also blaming the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a clear fear of spiders and communicated that they don't want to be pranked, which the friend is known for doing. However, the friend still brought the tarantula out in a way that could lead to a prank. The other friend's jump scare caused the accident. The author acted in reflex to protect themselves, which led to the spider's death.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The friend knew the author's fear and might have set up the situation knowing it could provoke a reaction. The other friend's prank was a direct cause. The author's action was a reflex to avoid a scary situation. The friend's anger seems to be misplaced because it was an accident caused by their own actions. The author had a right to protect themselves, even if it meant the spider died. However, intentionally killing the spider would be different, but here it was a reflex action. Also, the friend's responsibility for pranking and not securing the spider properly might contribute. So maybe the author isn't at fault here. Answering B makes sense because the author wasn't in the wrong given the circumstances.\n"
