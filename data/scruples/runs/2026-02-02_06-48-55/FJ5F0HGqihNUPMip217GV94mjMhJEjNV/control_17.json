I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend who has tarantulas, and the author ends up killing one when there's a jump scare. \n\nFirst, the friend showed the tarantulas in their enclosures. The author made it clear they didn't want to be pranked because they're scared of spiders. The other friend did a jump scare with a plate that had the tarantula on it, causing it to fly towards the author. The author threw a book in reflex and killed the spider.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author's fear was communicated, but the prank still happened. The tarantula was out of its enclosure, which the author usually tolerates if they're secure. The friend who did the prank was part of causing the incident. \n\nThe author's action was a reflex to protect themselves from a spider that was suddenly thrown their way. The friend is upset not just about the tarantula, but also calls the author a \"pussy,\" which suggests there's some blame shifting. The other people are blaming the author, but maybe they didn't consider the context of the prank.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend who did the prank might share some blame for not respecting the author's fear and for removing the tarantula from its enclosure. The author acted in a moment of fear, which could be reasonable given their phobia. However, the author did kill the tarantula, which is the friend's property and something they care about.\n\nBut since the tarantula was out of its enclosure due to the prank, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The friend knew the author's fear and still pranked them, which is the root issue. The author's action was a reflex, not premeditated. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether the prank was the main cause. Since the author communicated their fear and the prank led to the incident, the blame might be on the prankster. However, the author's action of killing the spider could still be seen as their responsibility if they felt they could control their fear, but given the suddenness and fear-induced reaction, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (author is not in the wrong) because the prank was a direct cause, and the author's reaction was reflexive due to their expressed fear. The friend who pranked them should have respected that. The author isn't to blame for the tarantula's death under those circumstances.\n"
