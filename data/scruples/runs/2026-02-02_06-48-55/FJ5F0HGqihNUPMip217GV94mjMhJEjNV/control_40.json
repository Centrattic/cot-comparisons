I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend showed off the tarantulas in their enclosures, and the person who asked the question (AITA) made it clear they didn't want to be pranked. Then, another friend jumped out and scared them with a plate that had the tarantula on it. The AITA person threw a book reflexively and killed the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend knew the person was scared of spiders and had warned them not to prank him. The prank was initiated by another friend, not the one who owns the tarantula. The tarantula was in a plate with a cover, which the other friend removed, causing it to fly out. The AITA person acted out of fear and reflex, not intentionally. \n\nNow, the key points here are intent and responsibility. The person didn't mean to harm the tarantula; they were reacting to a jump scare. The tarantula's owner, on the other hand, allowed the other friend to do the prank despite being warned. The owner might share some responsibility because they didn't ensure the tarantula was secure. \n\nBut the person who threw the book is being blamed by others. The question is if they are in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, since it was an accident. Morally, maybe they should be more careful, but given the circumstances of being scared out of their mind, it's a reflex action. The owner also didn't secure the tarantula properly during the prank. \n\nSo, the answer could lean towards the AITA person not being in the wrong (B) because they acted in fear and the prank was set up improperly. However, some might argue that they should have found another way to react instead of killing the spider. But considering the owner's role in the prank, it's more of a shared responsibility. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
