I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for killing a friend's tarantula.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author is afraid of spiders but okay as long as they're secured. The friend knows this and was warned not to prank the author. Another friend did a jump scare with a plate, causing the tarantula to fly toward the author. In a panic, the author threw a book and killed it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The friend who owns the tarantula knew the author's fear. He was told not to prank him. The other friend's prank was the immediate trigger. The author acted out of fear and reflex. The owner is now upset, accusing the author of being a \"pussy\" and killing an animal.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author didn't mean to kill it, but did act in self-defense due to fear. But the tarantula was in an enclosure, so maybe the owner's setup wasn't secure enough? However, the owner's friend's prank caused the accident. The author might not be at fault because the situation was a result of the prank. Plus, the author had warned about the fear and the friend who pranked had a cover plate, which could have prevented the incident. \n\nBut some might argue that regardless of the prank, the author's reaction led to killing the pet. But considering the context, it's a defensive reaction. The owner also pranked despite knowing the fear. So maybe the owner and the other friend share some responsibility. The author's actions were a reflex to a jump scare, not premeditated. So, probably not the author's fault. Answer B.\n"
