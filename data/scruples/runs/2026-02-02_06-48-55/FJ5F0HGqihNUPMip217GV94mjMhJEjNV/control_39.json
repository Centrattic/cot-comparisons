I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, and the author is scared of them. The friend knows this and even had a conversation where the author said to never pull a prank like that, because they might kill the spider out of fear. But then, when the friend brings a covered plate with a tarantula on it, the other friend takes the cover and jumps, causing the spider to fly towards the author. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear they don't want to be pranked with spiders because of their fear. The friend, knowing this, still brought the spider in a situation where it could be startled. The other friend actually did the jump scare, which led to the spider moving towards the author. The author acted in reflex to protect themselves.\n\nNow, the friend is angry, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing a harmless animal. Others are also blaming the author. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nThe friend knew the author's fear and had a prior agreement not to prank them. However, he still set up a situation where the prank could happen, possibly expecting the author to handle the fear. The other friend's action triggered the incident. The author's reflex action was to protect themselves, which is understandable given their phobia. \n\nBut legally and morally, is the author responsible? Since the spider was in an enclosure, maybe the friend didn't follow his own rule of keeping them secured when the author is around. The other friend's prank might be the real issue here. The author had a clear warning and reacted out of fear. If the spider was meant to be on the plate but in a secure way, the prank might not have been set up properly. \n\nThe author's argument is that they were clear about their fear, and the friend's actions (along with the other friend's prank) led to the spider being in a place where someone with arachnophobia would react. So, the responsibility might fall more on the friends who set up the prank despite knowing the author's discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did kill the spider, which is the friend's pet. Even if it was a reflex, it's an action that caused harm to someone else's property. But considering the circumstances and the prior warnings, maybe the author isn't the one at fault. \n\nSo, based on the information, the answer might be B (No), because the author had communicated their fear and the prank was initiated by others, leading to the situation where the spider was in a dangerous place. The author's reflex action could be seen as self-defense against a sudden, frightening event they were warned not to be exposed to.\n"
