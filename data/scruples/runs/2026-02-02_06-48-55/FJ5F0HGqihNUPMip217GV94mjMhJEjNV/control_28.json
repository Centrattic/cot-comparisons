I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The story says that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures and showed them during a PS4 game session. The author mentioned hating spiders and being okay with them in enclosures. They warned the friend not to prank them because they might kill the spider out of fear.\n\nThen, while the friend was getting food, another friend did a jump scare with a plate that had a tarantula on it, causing it to fly toward the author. In a reflex, the author threw a book and killed the tarantula. Now the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming them for killing a harmless animal. Others are also upset, including someone via WhatsApp.\n\nFirst, the author had made it clear they don't like spiders and warned against pranks. The other friend's jump scare was the immediate cause. The author acted on reflex to protect themselves. But was it wrong to kill the tarantula? The friend pranks them knowing their fear, but the author had given a warning. The other friend's action might be more to blame. However, the tarantula was in a plate, maybe not in the enclosure. If the friend kept them in enclosures, but someone else took it out without permission, that's an issue.\n\nThe author's argument is that the jump scare put the spider in danger. The friend's argument is that they were showing them in enclosures and the author shouldn't have killed it after being warned. But the author's reflex was based on fear. There's ambiguity here. Was the tarantula in a secure place? The plate with a cover might have been a makeshift container, but if it's not the proper enclosure, maybe the other friend's actions were reckless. However, the author did kill the animal. Even if it was a reflex, they should have considered the owner's feelings. The friend might have been upset because the tarantula had value to him, and the author's action was impulsive. So, is the author in the wrong? They might share some responsibility for not handling the situation more carefully, even in fear. But the other friend's prank was the initiating factor. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the author explicitly warned against pranks, and the other friend still did it. The author's fear is valid, but maybe the owner should have ensured the tarantula was safely contained. If the tarantula wasn't in an enclosure during the prank, the other friend is more at fault. But the author's action still led to the death. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could have tried to catch it instead of killing. However, in the moment of fear, it's understandable. The answer might be B, not the author's fault, since others' actions led to the incident despite warnings. But maybe the author should have considered better ways to handle it. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the main issue is the prank by the other friend, but the author's reflex killed it. The owner is responsible for the animal's safety, so if the prank involved taking it out of the enclosure, the owner might be at fault for not securing it properly. But the author had already stated they might kill it if pranked. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because their warning was ignored, leading to the situation. The answer is B.\n"
