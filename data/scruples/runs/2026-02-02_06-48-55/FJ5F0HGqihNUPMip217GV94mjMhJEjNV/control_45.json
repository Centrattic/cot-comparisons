I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for killing his friend's tarantula. So, the situation is that the friend has tarantulas, which the author really dislikes. The friend knows the author's fear and even told him not to prank him. Then, when the friend is away, another friend does a jump scare with a plate that has a tarantula on it. The author, in a panic, throws a book and kills the spider.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend who owns the tarantula had warned about pranks, and the jump scare was done by the other friend, not the author. The tarantula was on a plate with a cover, which was part of the prank. The author acted in reflex to protect himself.\n\nNow, the owner of the tarantula is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and blaming him for killing an innocent animal. Other people are also blaming him. But was the author really at fault here? The tarantula was part of a prank, which the owner had said not to do to the author. The author's reaction seems like a fear response, not premeditated. \n\nHowever, the author did kill the tarantula. The owner might feel that the author overreacted. But the prank was the initiating factor. If the owner had not allowed another friend to do the prank, maybe the incident wouldn't have happened. The author's action was a reflex, but the responsibility might lie more with the prankster who caused the tarantula to fly towards him.\n\nBut legally and morally, does the author have responsibility? If the tarantula was in an enclosed container and the prank was the cause, the other friend's actions might be the main issue. However, the author's fear was clear, and the owner knew about it. The owner might not have taken adequate precautions to prevent the prank, leading to the accident.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted out of fear and reflex. The prank was a significant contributing factor. The owner knew the author's dislike of spiders and allowed a prank that endangered the tarantula. The other friend's actions were reckless. Therefore, the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole. But I need to make sure. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. Since he was in fear and the prank was the cause, the blame might be on the prankster and the owner for not preventing it.\n"
