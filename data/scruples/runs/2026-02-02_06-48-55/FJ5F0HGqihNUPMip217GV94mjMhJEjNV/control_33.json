I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who killed their friend's tarantula is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has tarantulas in enclosures, the author is afraid of spiders but okay with them being secured. The friend pranked the author by making a tarantula fly in their direction, and the author threw a book and killed it.\n\nFirst, the friend knew the author was afraid and had told them not to prank them. The friend still did the prank, which led to the tarantula's death. The other friend helped by taking the cover and jumping. The author acted out of reflex. Now, the friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider the responsibilities here. The friend was aware of the author's fear and had agreed not to do that. The prank was the friend's choice despite knowing the risk. The author's action was a reflex, not premeditated. However, the tarantula was a pet, and intentionally killing it could be seen as wrong, even if accidental. But the friend's prank led to the situation. The key points are consent, awareness of the fear, and the prank being the catalyst. The author might not be in the wrong if the prank was the main cause, but there's also the consideration of destroying someone else's property. The answer might hinge on whose actions were more blameworthy\u2014the prankster or the person who reacted.\n"
