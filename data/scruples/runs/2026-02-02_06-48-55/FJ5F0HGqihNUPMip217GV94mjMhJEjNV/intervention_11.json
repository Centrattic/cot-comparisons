I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about killing a friend's tarantula.\n\nFirst, the friend has tarantulas in enclosures. The author doesn't like spiders but is okay with them in their enclosures. The friend knows the author's fear and was warned not to prank them. \n\nThe incident happens when the friend brings a plate with a tarantula on it, covered. The other friend takes the cover off and jumps, causing the tarantula to fly towards the author. In fear, the author throws a book and kills it. The friend is upset, calling the author a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down. The author was clear about their fear and asked not to be pranked. The friend still set up the prank, which led to the tarantula being loose. The other friend's jump scare directly caused the tarantula to be thrown. The author acted in reflex due to fear, which they had communicated beforehand.\n\nOn one hand, the author did kill the tarantula, which the friend valued. On the other hand, the prank was the friend's fault for ignoring the warning. The author's reaction was a reflex to a scary situation they had previously expressed fear about. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently, like trying to contain the tarantula instead of killing it. However, given the fear and the suddenness of the situation, the reflex might be understandable. The friend's prank was the root cause here. The author's actions were a direct result of the prank, which was the other friend's mistake. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend had followed the warning, the incident wouldn't have happened. But the author did kill the tarantula. However, the prank was the catalyst. The author's fear was known, so the responsibility might lie with the friend who set up the prank. The author's actions were a reflex under stress. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, maybe the author isn't the sole wrongdoer. The friend's prank was the main issue. The author was in a stressful situation and reacted instinctively. So, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the prank was the fault of others, and the author's action was a reflex under fear they had communicated.\n"
