I don't like spiders at all, they creep me out tremendously.\n\nHe invited me and another friend to his house to play PS4. He showed the tarantulas as usual, always inside their enclosures. He knows I hate having them close by, but if they're secured inside their little enclosure I'm okay with it. I know he has pranked people before so I made it very clear to never to that to me as I'd very likely just kill it out of fear.\n\nWe're playing PS4 and he goes get something for us to eat. Meanwhile I'm just looking at his books. He gets there with a plate with a cover on it, the kind that goes in the microwave so food doesn't splatter everywhere. Our other friend takes the cover and does a huge jump scare, hitting the plate and making the fucking tarantula fly in my direction. I had a book in my hand and out of reflex I threw the book at it killing it right there.\n\nSo now he's all pissed at me for being a \"pussy\" and killing an harmless animal. Other people are also blaming me for it and I even got an angry WhatsApp message from a guy that also has tarantulas at home.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for killing their friend's tarantula. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the writer doesn't like spiders and has made their friend aware of this. The friend has tarantulas in enclosures, which the writer is okay with as long as they're secure. The friend knows the writer's dislike and even knows that the writer might kill the spider if pranked. \n\nThen, during a PS4 session, the friend goes to get food, and the other friend uses a plate cover to jump-scare the writer. The cover hits the plate, causing the tarantula to fly towards the writer. In a reflex action, the writer throws a book and kills the spider. The friend is upset, calling the writer a \"pussy\" and others are blaming them too.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The writer made their discomfort clear, and the friend knew not to prank them. However, another friend decided to do a jump-scare, which led to the accident. \n2. The tarantula was in an enclosure, but the prank caused it to escape. The writer had no intention to harm it, but acted out of fear.\n3. The friend who owns the tarantula is upset, and others are blaming the writer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is at fault. On one hand, they did kill the spider, which is someone else's pet. But the circumstances were a result of a prank that the writer specifically warned against. The writer wasn't trying to harm the spider; it was a reflex action. The friend who set up the prank might be more at fault because they ignored the warning. \n\nHowever, the writer did have a responsibility to handle the situation differently. Maybe they could have tried to catch the spider instead of throwing a book. But given the fear and reflex, it's understandable. Also, the friend who owned the spider is responsible for securing it properly. If the enclosure wasn't secure enough to prevent the spider from escaping during a prank, that's a problem on their end.\n\nThe community's response might not consider the context fully, but legally and ethically, the writer might have acted in a moment of fear. However, they could be seen as responsible because they ended up killing the spider. But the prankster's actions directly caused the incident. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the main fault might lie with the friend who set up the prank, not the writer. The writer's actions were a direct reaction to a situation they were warned not to be pranked. However, since they did kill the spider, there's a case to be made that they are partially at fault. But considering the intent and provocation, maybe not entirely. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the writer not being the asshole. They followed their own warning, and the prank led to the accident. The owner is responsible for the spider's environment and should have ensured it was secure. The writer acted in self-defense against the fear-inducing prank. So, answer B.\n"
