Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that their girlfriend uses the bathroom frequently. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she needs to pee a lot. The author mentions it's affecting their activities\u2014long drives, shopping, dinners, even pausing movies or intimacy. They love her but are frustrated. The key points here are that she's 20, healthy, and there's no mention of a medical issue. Wait, the author says she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe there's no health problem causing it. But maybe there is an underlying condition they haven't discussed? The author isn't sure if she actually needs to go or is doing it to annoy them. That's a red flag because assuming bad intentions without evidence is problematic.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for feeling annoyed. The main question is about justification. The author is frustrated, but does that make them the asshole? Well, using the bathroom is a basic human need. If she's genuinely needing to go frequently, it's not her fault. The author's annoyance might be misplaced if they're not considering her needs. However, if there's no medical reason, maybe she's overdoing it? But the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her. They're just assuming she might be doing it on purpose or there's a medical issue. That's a key point\u2014communication is missing here.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid in that frequent bathroom breaks can be inconvenient, but the way they're handling it is the issue. They haven't talked to her about their feelings, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. Assuming she's doing it to annoy them without talking to her first could be unfair. Also, the author's tone suggests they're taking it personally, which isn't constructive. The girlfriend's health is mentioned as fine, so unless there's a medical issue they're not considering, the problem might be the author's reaction.\n\nBut wait, the author says \"she's only 20 and is perfectly healthy,\" which might mean there's no health issue. So why the frequent bathroom breaks? Could there be another reason, like anxiety or a habit? The author isn't considering that. They're just annoyed without addressing the root cause. The right approach would be to talk to her, express concern, and maybe suggest a doctor's visit if it's excessive. Since they haven't done that, they might be jumping to conclusions. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the author is not wrong for having feelings, but how they handle it matters. If they confront her without understanding, that's where they'd be wrong. So, the answer hinges on whether the author is justified in their annoyance without addressing it with her. Since they haven't communicated and are making assumptions, they might be in the wrong for not being considerate of her needs and possibly misjudging her intentions. However, if there's a valid reason for her frequent trips and the author is still annoyed without trying to resolve it, they could be the asshole. But since the question is about the author's feelings and not their actions, maybe they're not in the wrong yet. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. If the annoyance is reasonable given the situation, then they might not be. But if the annoyance stems from not considering her needs or possible misunderstandings, then they are. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The key is that the author hasn't discussed it with her. Without knowing the medical status, they assume she's fine. But if she's actually healthy, there's no medical reason, so maybe the author is being unreasonable. But if there's an unaddressed medical issue, the author isn't considering that. However, since the author already stated she's healthy, maybe the problem is the author's reaction. The correct approach is to talk to her, not just be annoyed. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed but might be in the wrong for not addressing it properly. Since the question is about being the asshole, the answer would be A if the author is in the wrong for their reaction. But if the annoyance is understandable, then B. \n\nIn the end, the author is not in the wrong for having feelings, but they should address it with their partner. Since the question is whether they're the asshole, the answer is B (they're not in the wrong) because they have the right to feel inconvenienced, but they need to handle it better. However, if the answer considers that assuming she's fine without medical confirmation is a problem, then A. But the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the correct answer depends on context. Given the info, maybe B is the answer because the author hasn't acted on their feelings yet, just feels annoyed. But the author's tone suggests they're making assumptions, which could make them the asshole. So maybe A.\n"
