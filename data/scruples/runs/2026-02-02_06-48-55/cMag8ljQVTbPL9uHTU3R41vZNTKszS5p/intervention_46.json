Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is annoyed because his girlfriend pees a lot, causing various inconveniences. He's wondering if he's the asshole for being annoyed by this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's a medical reason? But the author says she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe it's just her body's normal function. People can have different bathroom needs, and some people just need to go more frequently. \n\nThe author lists specific examples: long drives require stops every 2 hours, shopping trips, waiting at dinner, waking up at night, and even pausing movies or foreplay. That sounds like a lot, and while some might be normal, doing it that often could be a problem. But the key here is the author's reaction. He's annoyed and even suspects she's doing it to annoy him. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend is doing something that's a basic bodily function. Unless there's a medical issue, it's not her fault. The author's frustration is understandable, but he's not considering that maybe she can't help it. He's implying she might be doing it on purpose, which is a bit harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, if it's really that frequent and causing major disruptions, maybe there's a valid concern. But accusing her of doing it to annoy him is not fair. He should approach the situation with empathy first, maybe talk to her about it and see if there's a way to manage it together, rather than being annoyed and thinking she's trying to bother him. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being inconsiderate or not understanding a partner's needs can make the questioner the asshole. Since the author is taking his frustrations out on her without considering her perspective and even suggesting she's doing it intentionally, he might be in the wrong. He should address the issue with compassion and communication instead of just being annoyed. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
