Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks. The author loves her but feels inconvenienced in various situations like driving, shopping, dining, and even during intimate moments. They're wondering if they're the asshole for feeling this way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so unless there's a medical condition, her frequent urination might just be a habit or a personal quirk. The author is frustrated because it's affecting their shared activities and causing inconvenience. However, the author is trying to understand if their annoyance is justified or if they're being unreasonable.\n\nThe key points here are the frequency of the bathroom breaks and the impact on their relationship. The author mentions that they have to pause movies, stop driving, etc. But is this a valid reason to be annoyed? Well, everyone has different bathroom needs. Some people just go more often. The author's reaction is about inconvenience rather than a health issue. The girlfriend isn't doing this to be mean, as the author acknowledges she can't help it. \n\nBut wait, the author also speculates if she's doing it to annoy them, which introduces a level of distrust or suspicion. That's a red flag. Assuming someone's motives without evidence can be harmful. The author is considering confronting this without knowing if their feelings are justified. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If this is causing significant stress, the author should talk about it. But is the author in the wrong for feeling this way? If the girlfriend's behavior is normal for her, then the author's annoyance might be a personal issue they need to address. However, if the frequency is genuinely excessive and affecting their quality time, maybe there's a valid concern. \n\nBut since the girlfriend is healthy and the author is the one feeling annoyed, it's possible the author is overreacting. The fact that the author is questioning their own feelings (asking if they're the asshole) suggests they might be. The girlfriend isn't causing harm intentionally, so the author's frustration might be unwarranted. \n\nOn the other hand, if the bathroom breaks are truly excessive and not due to a medical issue, the author has a right to be concerned. But the story doesn't mention any medical issues, and the girlfriend is 20 and healthy. So maybe the author is just being annoyed by something that's a normal part of their partner's life. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is probably in the wrong because the girlfriend's behavior, while inconvenient, isn't malicious. The author's reaction is based on personal annoyance rather than a legitimate problem. The real issue might be the lack of communication. So the answer is A.\n"
