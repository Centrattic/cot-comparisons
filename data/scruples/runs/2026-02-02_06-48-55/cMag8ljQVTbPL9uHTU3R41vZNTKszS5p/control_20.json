Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20 and healthy, according to the author. He mentions that they can't drive more than two hours without stopping, shopping trips are interrupted, and even during dinner and movies. He's concerned that he's being an asshole for being annoyed, but he's unsure if she's actually needing to go or doing it to annoy him.\n\nHmm. Well, the author is expressing his frustration, which is valid. But the key here is whether his reaction is justified. Frequent urination can have medical causes, like a UTI or diabetes, but the author says she's healthy. However, maybe she's not aware of how often she's going. Or perhaps she's drinking a lot of fluids, which can increase bathroom trips.\n\nBut the author's issue is that he's annoyed and feels inconvenienced. The problem is that he's not approaching her about it, worried he'll come off as the asshole. But is his annoyance legitimate? Well, everyone has different thresholds for what they find irritating. However, if her behavior isn't harmful and she's not aware, maybe he should talk to her first instead of assuming she's doing it on purpose. On the other hand, if it's affecting their quality time together and causing stress, he shouldn't just bottle up his feelings.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's annoyed, that's his emotion, which is valid. However, how he handles it matters. If he were to confront her in a negative way, that could be the issue. But since he's not saying anything yet, maybe he's not in the wrong for feeling that way. However, if he's not considering her possible reasons and just taking it personally, that could be his fault. The article's advice often suggests considering the other person's perspective. Maybe the answer depends on whether he's addressing it constructively. Since he hasn't mentioned talking to her and is just venting about possible annoyance, maybe he's not the asshole, but he needs to approach it better. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong for being annoyed, but he should communicate with her. Alternatively, maybe A if his annoyance is unwarranted. But given that he's concerned and hasn't acted on it yet, probably B.\n"
