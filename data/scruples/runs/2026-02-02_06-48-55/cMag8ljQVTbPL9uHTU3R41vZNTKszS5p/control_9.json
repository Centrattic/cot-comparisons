Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is annoyed because their girlfriend has to go to the bathroom frequently, which is causing inconvenience in various situations like driving, shopping, dining, and even during intimate moments. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy. Frequent urination can have various causes\u2014maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids, or perhaps there's an underlying medical issue. But the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her. Instead, they're feeling annoyed and even suspecting she's doing it to annoy them, which is a serious accusation.\n\nNow, the author's perspective is that they're being inconvenienced repeatedly. However, it's important to assess whether the annoyance is justified. Human biology varies, and needing to urinate frequently isn't unusual in some contexts. If she's healthy, it might just be her body's normal function. The author's frustration is understandable, but the key point here is how they're handling it.\n\nThe author hasn't ruled out any medical reasons. They're making assumptions about her intentions (maybe she's doing it to annoy them) without addressing the issue. A healthy relationship requires communication and empathy. Instead of reacting with annoyance and suspicion, the appropriate step would be to talk to her about the frequency and see if there's an underlying issue. If there's a medical problem, they should seek advice together. If not, then finding ways to accommodate each other's needs is necessary.\n\nThe author's approach of being annoyed and considering not mentioning it unless they're sure they're not the asshole is problematic. They're internalizing the frustration instead of addressing it constructively. In a loving relationship, partners should support each other's health issues and find solutions. The author's initial reaction is to blame and accuse, which could be seen as dismissive of her needs and a lack of communication.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're not addressing the issue with empathy and communication, and instead reacting with annoyance and suspicion without understanding the root cause. The correct approach would be to discuss the situation with their partner to find a solution, not to assume the worst.\n"
