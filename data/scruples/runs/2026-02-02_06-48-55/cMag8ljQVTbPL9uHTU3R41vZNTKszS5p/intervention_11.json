Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is annoyed because his girlfriend goes to the bathroom very frequently. He lists several instances where this causes inconvenience, like during drives, shopping, meals, and even during sleep. He even suspects she might be doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The girlfriend is only 20 and healthy, so maybe there's a medical reason. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her. He's jumping to conclusions about her possibly faking it. That's a red flag because assuming the worst without talking could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing legitimate frustration. Frequent bathroom breaks can disrupt plans and intimacy. But the way he frames it\u2014suggesting she might be doing it to annoy him\u2014shows a lack of trust and consideration. It's important to approach such issues with empathy and communication rather than frustration.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed versus for not addressing it properly. Being annoyed is subjective, but if the annoyance leads to judgment or accusations without understanding, that's where the issue lies. The author hasn't communicated his feelings to her, which is the first step. Instead, he's considering the possibility that she's faking it, which is a negative assumption.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. The author should talk to his girlfriend about his concerns, ask if she's experiencing any medical issues, and see if there's a way to accommodate each other. By not addressing it and instead venting on an AITA forum, he's avoiding the problem and making assumptions. That makes him the asshole for not handling the situation maturely and for potentially blaming her without knowing the reason.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's being inconsiderate and making assumptions instead of communicating and understanding the root cause of her frequent bathroom needs.\n"
