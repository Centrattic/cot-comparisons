Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being annoyed because his girlfriend uses the bathroom a lot. He lists several instances where this is causing inconvenience during activities like driving, shopping, dining, and even during sleep. He's questioning if his annoyance is valid or if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is young, 20, and healthy. So there's no medical issue mentioned, but the author is implying that maybe she's doing it on purpose. He's frustrated because it's interrupting their time together. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, everyone needs to use the bathroom, and it's a basic human need. The author is acknowledging that she can't help it, which suggests he knows it's not malicious. But he's also wondering if she's doing it to annoy him, which introduces a possible element of distrust or insecurity. That could be a red flag. \n\nHowever, the frequency he's describing seems excessive. Even if she's healthy, someone can have a lower bladder capacity or other habits that make them go more often. But the author's frustration is leading him to question her intentions, which might not be fair. He's comparing it to her possibly being annoying, which could be dismissive of her needs. \n\nThe author is feeling inconvenienced, which is understandable. But the way he's framing it\u2014suggesting she might be doing it on purpose\u2014could be a sign that he's not approaching the situation with empathy. He's aware she's healthy, so maybe there's another reason. However, the fact that he's considering that she might be doing it to annoy him might indicate that his own stress or impatience is contributing to his annoyance. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. If the author is projecting his own impatience onto her, then he might be in the wrong. But if the frequency is truly affecting their quality time and he's struggling to communicate it without blame, then maybe he's not the asshole. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is approaching this with understanding or if he's making assumptions. The fact that he's considering not bringing it up if he's in the wrong shows some self-awareness, but his underlying suspicion that she's doing it on purpose is problematic. It's important to have a conversation to understand if there's a medical reason or if it's just a habit, rather than assuming malice. \n\nSo, in terms of the answer, the author is in the wrong because he's allowing his annoyance to overshadow empathy and is questioning his partner's intentions without discussing it openly. The answer would be A.\n"
