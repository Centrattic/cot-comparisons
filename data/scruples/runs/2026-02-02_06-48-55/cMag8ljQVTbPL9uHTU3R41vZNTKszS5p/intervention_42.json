Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom visits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that their girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot, which is causing them inconvenience. They love her, but it's getting on their nerves. The key points are the frequency of bathroom breaks during various activities and the author's frustration.\n\nNow, normal bladder function varies, but going frequently enough to disrupt activities might indicate something else. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, according to the author. However, frequent urination can sometimes be a sign of medical issues like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder. The author doesn't mention the girlfriend consulting a doctor, which might be a red flag. If there's no medical reason, maybe she's just drinking a lot of fluids, which is common, but it's not clear here.\n\nOn the other side, the author is expressing annoyance. It's natural to feel inconvenienced when plans are disrupted multiple times. But the way the author is thinking about whether it's annoying or if the girlfriend is doing it on purpose could be problematic. Accusing someone of faking bathroom breaks just to annoy is not fair. The author should consider if there's a medical reason first before assuming malice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. Being annoyed isn't inherently wrong, but how they handle it is. The real issue is that the author hasn't discussed this with their girlfriend yet. Instead of addressing it, they're venting on an anonymous forum. If the girlfriend doesn't have a medical issue, then it's a matter of communication and compromise. The author might need to approach the topic sensitively rather than being judgmental.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction. Since the author hasn't approached the girlfriend first and is considering the possibility that she might be faking it, that could indicate a lack of consideration. However, if the girlfriend's behavior is legitimate and the author is struggling to adjust, maybe there's a balance. But given the lack of communication and the assumption of annoyance without knowing the cause, I think the author is in the wrong. They should talk to her first, check for medical reasons, and find a solution together instead of just being annoyed and seeking validation.\n"
