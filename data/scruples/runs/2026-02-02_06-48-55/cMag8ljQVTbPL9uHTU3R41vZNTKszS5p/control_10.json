Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The author mentions that the girlfriend pees a lot and it's causing them to be inconvenienced in various situations\u2014long drives, shopping, dinners, etc. They even consider if she's doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author loves their girlfriend, but the problem is about the frequency of bathroom breaks. The key points are that the girlfriend is 20 and healthy. So, maybe there's a medical issue? But the author says she's healthy. Wait, maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids, or could it be something like a UTI? But the author states she's healthy, so maybe it's just a habit or something else.\n\nThe author feels annoyed because they have to pause activities, find bathrooms, wait, etc. But is their reaction reasonable? Well, everyone has different tolerances. However, the author isn't blaming a medical condition but rather the frequency. The girlfriend doesn't seem to be in distress, and the author is more annoyed than anything else.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting. In relationships, it's important to communicate. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering that it could be a health issue they don't know about. But the question is whether the author is the asshole for being annoyed. The answer depends on if the annoyance is justified. Since the author hasn't discussed it with their girlfriend and is speculating she might be doing it on purpose, that could be a red flag. They should talk about it first. But the question is if the author is wrong now. Since they haven't approached her, maybe they're not the asshole yet. But the act of being annoyed about something that's a natural bodily function could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author is trying to explain the inconvenience. So maybe answer B (No) because the author isn't necessarily wrong, but should communicate. Alternatively, answer A (Yes) if the annoyance is unjustified. Hmm. Need to decide. The girlfriend's health is mentioned as okay, so maybe there's no medical reason. But the author's reaction might be normal to a degree. However, the key is that they haven't discussed it with her yet. If they haven't brought it up, they might not be the asshole. But the annoyance itself isn't the issue. The problem is whether it's reasonable. If the girlfriend isn't ill, maybe the author is overreacting. But maybe she's pregnant or something? The user says she's 20 and healthy. So, maybe not. So the author's annoyance could be valid, but they should talk. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed, but they need to address it properly. So the answer is B.\n"
