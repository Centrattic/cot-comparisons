Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The problem is about the girlfriend going to the bathroom frequently, which the author finds annoying. The author loves her but is getting frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is expressing inconvenience, like stopping drives, shopping trips, and even during movies or intimate moments. However, the girlfriend is described as healthy and only 20, so maybe there's a medical reason? But the author doesn't mention her having a known medical issue. They do say she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe they've ruled that out.\n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable, but is it reasonable to be annoyed by something that's a natural bodily function? The key here is whether the author is being overly sensitive or if the girlfriend is being inconsiderate. The girlfriend isn't doing this to annoy him, as he mentioned she can't help it. The author is the one feeling inconvenienced, but is it his responsibility to be more patient?\n\nAlso, the author is considering whether to bring it up. If he doesn't address it, he might be avoiding a necessary conversation. But if he does, he needs to approach it without blaming her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, frequent bathroom breaks can be a common issue, and partners usually learn to accommodate each other. The author might need to adjust his expectations. On the other hand, if it's affecting their quality time and causing stress, maybe there's a valid concern. But since the girlfriend is healthy, maybe the author is overreacting. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because his annoyance stems from a natural function and he's not addressing it constructively. So Answer A.\n"
