Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where their girlfriend's frequent bathroom visits are causing them annoyance. They love her, but the constant interruptions are getting to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so there's no medical issue mentioned. The author lists various situations where she needs to go to the bathroom\u2014long drives, shopping, dinners, even during sleep. They mention that sometimes she pauses activities like movies or even foreplay. The author is conflicted because they love her but are getting annoyed.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations and communication. Is it normal for someone to need the bathroom that frequently? Maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids, but the author hasn't mentioned discussing this. The author is frustrated because these interruptions are affecting their plans and activities. But is that their fault for being annoyed?\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate concerns without blaming the other person. The author hasn't talked to her about this, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, if her bathroom visits are truly excessive and causing issues, the author is allowed to feel frustrated. The question is whether their annoyance makes them the asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, the author needs to approach this situation with empathy. Maybe her habits are normal, or maybe there's an underlying reason. Without discussing it, it's hard to know. The author's assumption that she might not even need to go sometimes is problematic. That suggests suspicion without evidence, which isn't healthy.\n\nBut the act of being annoyed isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has limits. The real issue is how they address it. If the author brings it up in a respectful way, considering her feelings and possible reasons, then it's okay. However, judging from the post, the author hasn't done that yet. So maybe the wrong is in not communicating first rather than the annoyance itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're just feeling annoyed without knowing the full story, maybe not. But if they're jumping to conclusions or being dismissive of her needs, then they might be. The answer hinges on whether the annoyance is justified and how it's handled. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong for being annoyed, and not for how they handle it, the answer might lean towards not being the asshole (B), but with a caveat to communicate. However, if the annoyance is based on invalid assumptions, maybe they are (A). Hmm.\n"
