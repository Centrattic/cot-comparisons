Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together almost a year and living together for two months. He loves her but is getting annoyed because she needs to pee a lot. The examples he gives are driving stops every 2 hours, shopping trips needing a bathroom break, waiting to leave dinner, and even interrupting movies or foreplay. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible reasons for her frequent urination. The author mentions she's 20 and healthy, but frequent urination can have medical causes like a UTI, diabetes, or overactive bladder. If she's been to the doctor and it's confirmed she's healthy, maybe it's a habit or something else. But if she hasn't been checked, that's a red flag. The author hasn't mentioned if she's had medical evaluation, which could be important.\n\nNext, the author's reaction. He's annoyed and even suspects she's doing it to annoy him. That's a negative assumption. If he's making that assumption without evidence, that's not good. Communication is key in relationships. Instead of being annoyed, he should talk to her first. Maybe there's an underlying issue he's not aware of.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's genuinely healthy and there's no medical reason, then maybe she's not managing her bathroom breaks efficiently. But it's possible he's overreacting. The frequency he describes does seem high. Two hours of driving without a bathroom break is a lot. Maybe she's drinking too much water or caffeine, which can increase urination. If he's not discussing it with her, he's not addressing the problem constructively.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is being unreasonable. If his annoyance leads him to accuse her without understanding the cause, that's his fault. But if he's genuinely trying to work through it and is just expressing frustration, maybe not. However, the fact that he's considering if he's the asshole suggests he's aware his feelings might not be justified. He should talk to her first before jumping to conclusions.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's making assumptions and not addressing the issue properly, then yes. If he's just frustrated and looking for a way to handle it, maybe not. But since he's considering not mentioning it because he's worried he's the asshole, there's a need for communication. The answer would be A (he's in the wrong) if he's not approaching it with understanding and communication. But if he's just feeling annoyed and hasn't acted on it yet, maybe B. But the fact that he's thinking about it without discussing it first points to A. So the answer is A.\n"
