Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is annoyed because his girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot. They mention that she needs to stop every two hours on a drive, during shopping, after dinner, and even during the night. He's starting to wonder if she's doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if frequent urination could be a medical issue. The user says she's 20 and healthy, but maybe there's an underlying condition like a UTI, diabetes, or something else. If it's medical, then it's not her fault, and the author's annoyance is misplaced. But the author isn't mentioned addressing this with her, which is a problem. He's assuming she's healthy, but maybe he should have checked that first.\n\nNext, the author's reaction. He's frustrated and even suspects she's doing it to annoy him. That's a big red flag. Assuming the worst about a partner's intentions without evidence can lead to resentment. The fact that he's considering not mentioning it because he doesn't want to be the asshole shows he's aware of his position, but he's still feeling the need to vent.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author hasn't discussed this with his girlfriend, so he doesn't know her perspective. Maybe she's embarrassed or dealing with something. By not talking to her, he's letting his annoyance grow without trying to understand or find solutions. That's a point against him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author loves her and the time they spend together. He's trying to balance his feelings with his annoyance. The question is whether his frustration is valid. While it's understandable to feel inconvenienced, expecting someone to suppress natural bodily functions is unreasonable. But the author's approach of being annoyed and possibly accusing her of being annoying might be the issue here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he hasn't communicated with his girlfriend, hasn't considered possible medical reasons, and is making assumptions about her intentions. His annoyance is valid to some extent, but the way he's handling it is where he's at fault. Therefore, the answer should be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
