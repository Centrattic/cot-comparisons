Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being annoyed that their girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot. They mention various situations where her frequent bathroom breaks are causing inconvenience. They love her and acknowledge she's healthy, but it's getting on their nerves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, everyone has different bathroom needs, and it's a basic human function. The author is frustrated because it's interrupting their time together. But the girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's no medical issue. However, even if she's healthy, people can have different bladder capacities or habits. Could there be an underlying issue? The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, so maybe there's a lack of communication. \n\nBut the author is the one feeling annoyed and questioning if they're being unreasonable. The girlfriend might not realize the extent of the inconvenience. On the other hand, the author is choosing to focus on something that's a normal bodily function, which could be seen as petty. But again, if it's affecting their quality time, it's a valid concern. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. The question is about the author's justification for their feelings. If the girlfriend's bathroom breaks are legitimate and she's not doing it to be a bother, then the author's annoyance might stem from impatience or not considering her needs. However, the author hasn't communicated their feelings, which is important. If they had, maybe there's a solution both can agree on. \n\nBut according to the initial question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A (yes) if the author is in the wrong. Considering that the issue is about a natural bodily function and the author hasn't discussed it with their partner, it's possible the author is overreacting. The girlfriend's needs are normal, so the author's frustration might be unwarranted. However, if the frequency is truly excessive without a medical reason, maybe there's a valid point. But since the author states she's healthy, it's likely just a difference in habits. \n\nIn relationships, understanding and accommodation are key. The author might need to adjust their expectations. So the answer could lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for being annoyed over something that's natural, especially without discussing it first.\n"
