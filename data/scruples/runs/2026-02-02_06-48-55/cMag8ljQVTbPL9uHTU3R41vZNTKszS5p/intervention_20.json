Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong because they're annoyed by their girlfriend urinating frequently. The author lists several situations where this is causing inconvenience, like during drives, shopping, movies, and even during intimate moments. They also mention that she's young and healthy, so maybe there's no medical reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they love their girlfriend but are getting annoyed. The key here is whether the author's annoyance is a valid reason to be upset or if they should handle it more compassionately. The girlfriend's health is mentioned as perfect, so it's not a medical issue. However, people have different bladder control, and maybe she's just more frequent than average. \n\nThe author is questioning if they're the asshole for being annoyed. They feel bad but are frustrated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend isn't being inconsiderate and it's just a natural bodily function, then the author's frustration might be misplaced. The author should probably talk to her about it in a kind way instead of just being annoyed. \n\nBut if the author is being unreasonable and the girlfriend's needs are normal, then the author might be the one being inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is indeed going more than usual and there's no medical cause, maybe there's room for her to adjust. However, the author hasn't approached the situation by discussing their feelings yet, so jumping to conclusions might not be right. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on empathy and communication. Since the author hasn't addressed the issue yet, they might be in the wrong for harboring resentment instead of talking about it. The answer would likely be that the author is the asshole (A) because they're reacting negatively to a normal bodily function without addressing it respectfully first.\n"
