Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the person is annoyed that their girlfriend has to pee a lot and it's causing them inconvenience. They mention that she can't go more than 2 hours in the car without needing a bathroom break, and similar issues when they're out. They also say that she sometimes pauses activities like movies or even foreplay to go to the bathroom, and they suspect she might be doing it just to annoy them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. Frequent urination can be a medical issue. Even if the girlfriend is healthy, maybe there's an underlying condition she hasn't addressed. However, the author states she's 20 and perfectly healthy. So maybe it's just her body's normal function. But why is it so frequent?\n\nThe author is expressing frustration, which is understandable given the situations described. But is it their fault for being annoyed? The key here is whether the author is overreacting or if the girlfriend isn't managing her needs in a way that's considerate. However, the girlfriend's needs are biological, so she can't control that. The author's annoyance might be valid, but they should approach it without blaming her for something she can't help.\n\nAlso, the author is considering whether to mention it to her, which shows they care. But maybe they should first check if there's a medical reason. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. The answer depends on whether the annoyance is reasonable. Since it's a biological need, the author isn't wrong for being inconvenienced, but they need to handle it with understanding. However, the girlfriend might not be aware of how it affects the author. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but they should communicate better instead of just being annoyed.\n"
