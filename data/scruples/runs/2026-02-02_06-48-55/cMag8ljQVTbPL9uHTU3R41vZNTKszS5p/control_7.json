Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom use. The author mentions that their girlfriend, who's 20 and healthy, needs to go to the bathroom often in various situations\u2014like during drives, shopping, dinner, and even during movies or foreplay. They're wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is clearly frustrated, but is their frustration justified? Frequent urination can be a medical issue, even in a young person. Maybe the girlfriend has something going on like a UTI, diabetes, or something else. Although the author says she's \"perfectly healthy,\" maybe she hasn't been checked out. But the author is questioning if she's doing it on purpose to annoy them, which is a big assumption. That could be dismissive of real health issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their feelings of being inconvenienced. It's natural to feel annoyed if someone's behavior impacts your plans. But the key here is communication. The author hasn't talked to their girlfriend about this, which is a problem. Instead of assuming she's doing it to annoy, they should approach her with concern rather than frustration. If the girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks are affecting their relationship, they need to address it respectfully.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author hasn't discussed this with their girlfriend, they might be making assumptions. However, if the girlfriend's behavior is indeed excessive and the author's frustration is a normal reaction, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is being inconsiderate or not considering possible health issues, that could be where they're at fault.\n\nMedical concerns aside, the author's tone suggests they might not have communicated their feelings properly. They should talk to their girlfriend first to understand her situation. If she's healthy and the bathroom breaks are excessive, maybe there's a behavioral or psychological reason. But without communication, the author is jumping to conclusions. So, the author's mistake is not addressing the issue constructively and making assumptions about her intentions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and open dialogue.\n"
