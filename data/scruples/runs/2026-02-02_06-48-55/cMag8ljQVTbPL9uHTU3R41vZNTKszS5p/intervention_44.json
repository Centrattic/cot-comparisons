Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who goes to the bathroom frequently, and the author is annoyed by it. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's no medical issue. But the author mentions that she needs to stop during drives, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimate moments. That seems a lot. The author loves her and doesn't think she's doing it on purpose, but it's getting on their nerves.\n\nNow, the key points here are frequency and impact. How often is \"so much\"? The author lists multiple situations where it's causing inconvenience. Even if the girlfriend is healthy, frequent urination can have other causes, maybe something as simple as drinking a lot of fluids, but maybe there's a medical condition they're not aware of. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, which is important.\n\nThe author is feeling annoyed but also feels guilty for that. They're considering if they're the asshole for being annoyed. The question is whether the annoyance is justified. On one hand, it's a normal bodily function; everyone needs to use the bathroom. But if it's excessive, it could interfere with their quality time. However, the author hasn't confronted her about it yet, so maybe there's a reason she's doing it, or maybe it's a medical issue they need to address together.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reaction. They're considering not mentioning it, which could lead to resentment. Open communication is key in relationships. Maybe the author should talk to her about how often she's going and if there's an underlying issue, rather than just being annoyed. But if the author isn't addressing it and is just feeling annoyed, that might make them the asshole for not discussing it constructively.\n\nAlso, the author mentions pausing activities. If it's affecting their shared time significantly, it's a valid concern. However, assuming it's normal behavior and being annoyed without knowing the cause could be unfair. The girlfriend might not have control over it, but the author hasn't discussed it yet. So, without talking to her, the author might be making assumptions.\n\nIn summary, the author is experiencing valid feelings of being inconvenienced, but the right approach would be communication. If the author hasn't discussed it with her, maybe they're not the asshole, but if they're silently annoyed without addressing the issue, they might be. The answer depends on whether the annoyance is justified before communication. Since the author hasn't talked to her yet, maybe they're not in the wrong, but they should. However, if the frequency is truly excessive and affecting their life, maybe it's a valid concern. But if it's within normal range, they might be overreacting.\n\nGiven that the author is considering if they're the asshole and hasn't communicated, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're annoyed without knowing the full story. But if the frequency is indeed abnormal, maybe not. Since the girlfriend is healthy, maybe it's just normal, and the author is overreacting. So A.\n"
