Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for being annoyed because their girlfriend pees a lot. They mention it's affecting their plans and causing inconvenience. First, I need to consider if there's an underlying medical issue. The post says she's 20 and healthy, but maybe there's something the author isn't aware of. Like, maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids or has a medical condition that's not immediately obvious. If that's the case, the author's annoyance might be unfounded.\n\nThen, the author's behavior. They're annoyed to the point of questioning if she's doing it on purpose. That's a red flag. It's not just being inconvenienced; it's thinking the worst of her intentions. Relationships require communication. Instead of addressing it, the author is silently annoyed and even considering if she's trying to annoy them. That's not healthy. The right approach would be to talk to her about it, not assume the worst or bottle up their feelings.\n\nAlso, the author is comparing their own feelings against hers. They acknowledge she can't help it but still feel justified in being annoyed. But if she's genuinely dealing with a medical issue, that's more significant. The author should support her. If it's just a habit, maybe there are ways to adjust without being resentful. The key point here is communication. The author hasn't talked to her yet, so it's hard to judge without that context. But their current attitude\u2014thinking she might be doing it to annoy them\u2014shows a lack of empathy and understanding. So, yeah, the author is in the wrong because they're not approaching the issue with compassion and are making assumptions instead of seeking solutions.\n"
