Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being annoyed because their girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot, causing various inconveniences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author loves their girlfriend, but the frequency of her bathroom breaks is getting on their nerves. They mention specific examples like driving for two hours without stopping, shopping interruptions, and even during dinner and sleep. The author is conflicted because they feel bad for being annoyed but are struggling with the constant interruptions.\n\nNow, the key here is to assess whether the author is unreasonable. On one hand, needing to use the bathroom is a normal, natural bodily function. The author is frustrated by the frequency, but unless there's a medical issue, it's not something the girlfriend can control. The author's annoyance might stem from not considering her needs or not communicating their feelings properly.\n\nThe author also mentions wondering if the girlfriend is doing it to annoy them, which could indicate suspicion without evidence. That's a red flag because assuming negative intent can strain relationships. The author hasn't discussed the issue with her yet, which is important. Instead of addressing it, they're seeking validation online, which might not be the best approach.\n\nHowever, there's a point where excessive bathroom visits could be a medical concern. The post states she's 20 and healthy, but maybe there's an underlying issue they haven't considered. Still, the author's approach is to complain about the inconvenience rather than express support or offer solutions.\n\nIn relationships, empathy and communication are crucial. The author's frustration is valid to an extent, but it's the way they're handling it that matters. Being annoyed is one thing, but not addressing it constructively can be problematic. The author might benefit from talking to their girlfriend about how they feel, perhaps suggesting practical solutions instead of just being annoyed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach is flawed. However, the question is whether they are the asshole. If the girlfriend is genuinely having medical issues, the author's frustration is misplaced. If not, maybe there's a valid reason to discuss it. But since the post says she's healthy, the author's annoyance seems unwarranted. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more understanding and communication.\n"
