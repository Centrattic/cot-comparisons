Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being annoyed because his girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot, causing various inconveniences. He's wondering if he's the asshole for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that his girlfriend is healthy and only 20, so there's no medical issue causing her frequent bathroom breaks. But the frequency is so high that it's affecting their activities\u2014like driving, shopping, dining, even during movies and intimate moments. The author is frustrated and feels like he can't even mention it without being an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid feelings. It's natural to feel annoyed when plans are constantly disrupted. However, the way he's approaching it is important. He's questioning if he's wrong to feel this way, which suggests he's trying to be empathetic. But he's also considering not mentioning it to her, which might not be the healthiest approach for the relationship. \n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: even if she's healthy, going to the bathroom frequently could be a sign of a medical issue. The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, so maybe she's unaware. If he's just annoyed without knowing the cause, that's different. The author might be projecting his frustration without understanding her reasons, which could be innocent. But if there's no medical reason, maybe she's just naturally more frequent, and the author's frustration is about her habits rather than a medical condition.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's annoyed but hasn't communicated it in a constructive way, he might be. The key is how he addresses it. If he's holding it in and maybe acting resentful, that's a problem. But if he's just feeling the frustration and seeking advice on whether it's valid, then maybe he's not in the wrong for having the feelings. However, the way he's thinking about it\u2014questioning if she's doing it to annoy him\u2014could imply some suspicion or lack of trust, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author hasn't talked to his girlfriend about his feelings yet, so he's not at fault for being annoyed, but he's in the wrong for not addressing it constructively. However, since he's asking for advice and showing some self-awareness (feeling bad for being annoyed), he's not entirely in the wrong. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings but hasn't acted on them in a harmful way yet. The main issue is the lack of communication, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author hasn't done anything harmful yet, just feeling annoyed, he's not the asshole.\n"
