Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main issue is that the author is annoyed because their girlfriend uses the bathroom a lot. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's a medical reason they're not aware of? The author lists several situations where this is causing inconvenience: stopping during drives, shopping, waiting after dinner, waking up at night, pausing movies or even foreplay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if frequent urination is a sign of something medical. Conditions like diabetes, UTIs, interstitial cystitis, or even overactive bladder could cause this. If the girlfriend hasn't been to the doctor, maybe the author should approach it with concern rather than annoyance. The author mentions the girlfriend can't help it, but maybe she's unaware of the frequency affecting their life.\n\nThen, the author is feeling annoyed and wants to know if they're the asshole. If the girlfriend's behavior is due to a medical issue, the author's frustration without addressing it with her first could be seen as insensitive. However, if it's just a habit or something she's doing without a valid reason, the author might have a legitimate concern.\n\nBut the key here is communication. The author hasn't mentioned this to her yet. They're just thinking about whether it's their fault for being annoyed. Without talking to her first, it's hard to tell if there's an underlying issue. The author's approach is to hide their feelings instead of discussing them, which might not be the healthiest way to handle a relationship problem.\n\nAlso, the author's tone seems to imply that the girlfriend might be doing it to annoy them, but that's speculative. Assuming negative intent without knowing the reason could be problematic. The author could be overreacting or not considering that the girlfriend is doing her best without realizing the impact.\n\nSo, if the author hasn't communicated this to her and is just venting about their feelings, maybe they're not entirely wrong. However, if the girlfriend's frequent bathroom use is affecting their quality time and daily activities, it's something that needs to be addressed. But the way the author is approaching it\u2014internally deciding they're annoyed without talking to her first\u2014might make them the asshole because they could be making assumptions and not offering support.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address such issues with empathy. The author might need to first check if there's a medical reason and then discuss how it's affecting their time together. If they don't do that and just focus on their annoyance, they might be in the wrong. But if they're genuinely concerned and seek solutions together, maybe not. Since they haven't communicated yet, the situation is a bit ambiguous. But the fact that they're considering not mentioning it shows they're aware of the potential sensitivity, which is a positive. Still, the annoyance without understanding the cause could be the issue here.\n"
