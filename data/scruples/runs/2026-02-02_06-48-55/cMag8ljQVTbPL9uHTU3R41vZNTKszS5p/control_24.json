Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks. The situation is that they can't go on drives longer than 2 hours without stops, shopping gets interrupted, even during dinner and movie nights. The author feels it's getting on their nerves and even suspects the girlfriend might be doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend is only 20 and healthy, so maybe there's a medical reason? But the author hasn't mentioned discussing this. If she's healthy, maybe she's just drinking a lot of fluids, which can cause frequent urination. Or maybe she has a condition like diabetes or a UTI, but since she's said to be healthy, that might not be the case here.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Constant interruptions in activities can be annoying. But the key here is how they're handling it. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for feeling annoyed, but not addressing whether they've communicated their feelings to the girlfriend. If they haven't talked to her about it, maybe they're not handling it the right way. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation as described, not in their approach to handling it.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is causing inconvenience. It's a matter of perspective. The author is within their right to feel frustrated, but the way they handle the situation matters. The problem might be more about communication. The author might not be the asshole for feeling annoyed, but if they ignore the issue or react poorly instead of discussing it, that's where things could go wrong. However, the scenario only mentions the author's feelings and not their actions towards the girlfriend. So based on the information given, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but they should address it respectfully.\n\nAnother angle: if the girlfriend's bathroom breaks are excessive without a valid reason, maybe she's overdoing it. But the author shouldn't assume she's doing it to annoy them. It's possible she's unaware of the frequency. The author's annoyance is a natural reaction, but they need to approach it with empathy. So, the author isn't the asshole, but they need to talk to her to find a solution. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but they need to address it properly.\n"
