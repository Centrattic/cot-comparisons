Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. The author lists several situations where his girlfriend needs to go to the bathroom often, causing inconvenience. He feels guilty but is really annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical possibilities. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, but frequent urination can be due to various reasons like diabetes, UTIs, or even something like drinking a lot of fluids. The author hasn't mentioned her consulting a doctor, so maybe that's a factor. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the medical aspect.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author loves her but is frustrated. The problem is that he's annoyed and even suspects she's doing it to annoy him. That's a red flag because assuming intent without evidence can be disrespectful. He's projecting possible motives onto her, which isn't fair. He should talk to her about his feelings instead of making assumptions.\n\nAlso, the author is considering whether to mention his annoyance. If he hasn't already discussed it with her, he might be avoiding communication to avoid conflict, which isn't the best approach. Open communication is key in relationships, so not talking about it could lead to more resentment. However, the way he approaches the conversation matters. He needs to be empathetic and not accusatory.\n\nOn the other hand, if her frequent bathroom visits are genuinely due to a medical issue, he should be supportive. But if it's a habit without medical cause, maybe there's room for adjustment. However, his annoyance is about inconvenience rather than a health concern. The key here is whether his reaction is proportionate. While it's understandable to feel inconvenienced, the frequency described seems excessive, and maybe he's not managing expectations properly.\n\nBut the main issue is his approach. He's considering whether he's the asshole for being annoyed, which shows some self-awareness. However, by not addressing it with her and instead making assumptions (like thinking she's doing it to annoy him), he's not handling it constructively. He's also not considering that her health might be a factor, which could change the perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's letting his annoyance affect his relationship without addressing the issue properly. He should communicate his feelings to her, check if there's a medical reason, and work together to find solutions. His current attitude and assumptions are disrespectful and could harm the relationship.\n"
