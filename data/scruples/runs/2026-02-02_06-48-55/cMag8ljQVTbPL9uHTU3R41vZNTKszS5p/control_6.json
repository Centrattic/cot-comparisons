Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom needs. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend is healthy and only 20, so there's no medical issue. He's been with her for a year and they live together. The main issue is the frequency of her needing to use the bathroom, which causes him inconvenience in various situations like driving, shopping, dining, and even during movies or intimate moments.\n\nHe feels that she might be stopping for bathroom breaks unnecessarily. The key points here are his annoyance and the assumption that she might be doing it to annoy him. \n\nNow, I need to consider if his annoyance is justified. On one hand, it's reasonable to be frustrated if someone's actions repeatedly inconvenience you. But I should also think about empathy. Since she's healthy and there's no medical reason, maybe she just has a higher water intake or a sensitive bladder. However, he's not suggesting she has a health problem, so that's something.\n\nHe's also questioning if he's being an asshole by being annoyed. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's expressing frustration over legitimate inconveniences without being abusive or dismissive of her needs, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's assuming she's doing it on purpose, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the story is about his feelings of annoyance, not about him being abusive. He loves her and doesn't want to hurt her feelings, so he's conflicted. The community often advises open communication in such situations. If he's not communicating his feelings, maybe he's not wrong, but if he were to confront her without understanding, that could be an issue. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not if he will be if he doesn't talk to her. \n\nSince the story is from his perspective and he's seeking validation, the answer might hinge on whether his frustration is normal or if he's overstepping. The answer probably leans towards him not being in the wrong because he's expressing frustration over a legitimate annoyance, but it's important to consider the other person's perspective as well.\n"
