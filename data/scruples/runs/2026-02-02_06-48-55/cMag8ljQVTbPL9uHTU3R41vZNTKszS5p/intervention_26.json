Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is annoyed because his girlfriend uses the bathroom a lot, which is causing him inconvenience in various situations like driving, shopping, dining, etc. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the frequency of bathroom breaks is affecting their daily activities. However, the key here is to determine if his reaction is justified. The girlfriend is described as healthy and only 20 years old, so unless there's a medical condition, maybe the author is overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that she sometimes pauses activities like watching a movie or even foreplay. That seems excessive unless she genuinely has a medical issue. The author is questioning if he's being an asshole for being annoyed. \n\nI should also consider if the author has communicated his feelings properly. He's thinking about not bringing it up because he might be the asshole. But maybe he should talk to her first to understand if there's an underlying issue. \n\nIf the girlfriend doesn't have a medical condition, the author might be in the wrong for being annoyed at something that's a natural bodily function. However, if the bathroom breaks are truly excessive and seem unnecessary, maybe she should see a doctor. But the author's frustration is real, so there's a balance. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for his reaction. If the girlfriend is healthy and there's no medical cause, then the author's annoyance might be unwarranted. But if there's a medical issue, then it's not her fault. The author hasn't ruled that out, so maybe he's assuming she's healthy without evidence. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's reaction is reasonable. If the girlfriend's bathroom use is normal, the author is in the wrong. If it's excessive and causing significant disruption, maybe she's the one at fault. But since the author is the one asking if he's in the wrong, and the situation is presented as a complaint about her behavior, it's possible he's the one being overly critical. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the situation doesn't indicate a medical issue for the girlfriend, and the author's frustration seems to stem from her natural bodily functions. However, if the bathroom use is truly excessive and there's no medical cause, maybe the girlfriend should be concerned. But the author's annoyance without addressing the root cause makes him the asshole here.\n"
