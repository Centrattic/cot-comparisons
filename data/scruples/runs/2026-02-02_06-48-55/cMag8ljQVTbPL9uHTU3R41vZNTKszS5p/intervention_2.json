Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is annoyed because their girlfriend goes to the bathroom frequently, causing inconveniences during drives, shopping, dinners, and even during movies or intimate moments. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's a medical reason, but the author isn't sure. They're worried she might be doing it on purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. Frequent urination can be a symptom of various health issues like diabetes, UTIs, overactive bladder, etc. Since the girlfriend is healthy, maybe it's just anxiety or a habit. But the author is expressing frustration about the constant interruptions. However, the key here is that the author is speculating that she might be doing it to annoy them, which could be a sign of distrust or projection. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not blaming the girlfriend but is asking if they're in the wrong for being annoyed. It's possible that the author's annoyance is valid, but their approach might be the issue. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people often get called out for not considering the other person's health or for overreacting. If the girlfriend has a legitimate reason, the author should support her instead of getting annoyed. However, if there's no medical issue, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. But the post mentions that the girlfriend is \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe there's no medical cause. Still, the author hasn't approached the girlfriend to discuss it, which could be a problem. Assuming the worst (that she's doing it on purpose) without talking to her first is a red flag. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is not having an open conversation with their partner. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for not addressing the situation constructively and for making assumptions. Their frustration might be valid, but their reaction\u2014thinking it's annoying and possibly intentional\u2014without discussing it could be seen as dismissive or inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might hinge on communication. Since the author hasn't talked to their girlfriend yet, assuming she's healthy, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author's annoyance might be justified, but their approach is problematic. So, they could be in the wrong for not addressing it properly.\n"
