Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom visits. The author lists several examples of how this is causing inconvenience, but also acknowledges that she's healthy and only 20. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting their shared activities. The author feels the need to mention it on Reddit, seeking validation. The key here is whether the annoyance is justified or if the author is overreacting.\n\nThe author mentions that their plans are constantly interrupted. For example, driving longer than two hours isn't possible without stops. That seems extreme. Frequent bathroom use could be due to various reasons like drinking a lot of water, certain medications, or even anxiety. But the author hasn't discussed this with their girlfriend yet, which is a problem. \n\nHowever, the author is asking if they're the asshole for being annoyed. It's possible that the girlfriend's bathroom trips are normal for her, and the author is stressed about it. On the flip side, if the frequency is truly excessive and causing significant issues, maybe there's an underlying health issue the girlfriend isn't aware of. \n\nBut the author hasn't approached the situation with empathy. They're speculating about the reasons instead of talking to their girlfriend. The fact that they're considering if she's doing it to annoy them shows a lack of trust. Communication is key here. Without discussing it, the author can't know the cause. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, everyone has different bathroom needs. But the author's frustration is valid. However, being annoyed isn't inherently wrong, but the approach matters. The real issue is whether the author is inconsiderate by not addressing it with their girlfriend first. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the issue instead of just being annoyed and seeking validation online. They should talk to her to understand the cause before making judgments. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
