Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author (a guy) is being unreasonable for getting annoyed because his girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so there's no medical issue indicated. The guy mentions that she needs to stop during drives, shopping, after dinner, and even during intimate moments. He's frustrated because these interruptions are affecting their activities. He's trying to figure out if he's being the asshole (AITA) for feeling annoyed.\n\nNow, I have to consider both sides. On one hand, the guy's feelings are valid\u2014he's frustrated by the constant interruptions. But on the other hand, needing to go to the bathroom is a basic human function. Unless there's an underlying medical condition, it's a normal bodily function. The girlfriend might not be able to control how often she needs to go, especially if she's drinking fluids regularly. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend is healthy and there's no medical issue, then her needing to go to the bathroom is normal. The guy's annoyance might be due to a lack of understanding or impatience. He might be expecting the relationship to be perfect and not account for the normal, everyday inconveniences that come with being in a close relationship. \n\nAlso, the way he phrases it\u2014like questioning whether she's doing it to annoy him\u2014suggests some level of suspicion or distrust, which could be a red flag. It's possible he's not being empathetic enough. Everyone has bathroom needs, and it's part of life. The author might be overreacting or not managing his expectations properly. \n\nBut maybe there's something else. If the girlfriend is actually going more than usual, maybe there's a medical reason, but the post says she's healthy. So unless there's more to the story, the author's frustration might be misplaced. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's annoyed over a normal bodily function and should be more accommodating. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's a cultural or situational nuance. For example, if they're living together, maybe she's drinking a lot of water or has a habit that's causing frequent bathroom breaks. But the post says she's healthy, so that's probably not the case. The key point is that the author is getting annoyed over something that's a natural part of life. So yes, he's the asshole here.\n"
