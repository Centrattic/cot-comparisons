Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong because they're annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent urination. They provided the story, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend is healthy, 20 years old, and the author is complaining about the frequency of bathroom breaks. The key points are that she's healthy, so it's not a medical issue. The author mentions various situations where this is a problem, like driving, shopping, movies, and even during intimate moments. He's considering whether he's the asshole for being annoyed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, it's important to communicate. If this is a recurring issue that's affecting their quality time together, the author shouldn't just bottle it up. However, the way he's approaching it matters. Is he being reasonable? Well, if she's healthy, there's nothing wrong with her needing to use the bathroom frequently. It's a basic human need. The author's frustration is understandable, but is he justified in being annoyed?\n\nBut here's the thing: people vary in their bathroom habits. Some people go more frequently than others. Unless there's a medical condition, it's not something she can control. The author is choosing to be annoyed by something that's a normal bodily function. That does seem a bit unreasonable. Also, considering they're in a committed relationship, it's important to be understanding and accommodating. Maybe the author could adjust his expectations or discuss it with her to find solutions, like planning stops during long drives or being more flexible during outings. However, the post as written shows frustration without any indication of having discussed the issue with her yet. If he hasn't talked to her, maybe he's not in the wrong for feeling that way, but he's definitely in the wrong for not addressing it constructively. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether being annoyed is wrong. Since it's a normal need, the author is being petty. The answer might be that he's in the wrong because he's focusing on something trivial. Alternatively, if he's not communicating, maybe he's not the asshole but should be. The AITA community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. In this case, the author is annoyed by a normal, necessary activity. That seems like a minor issue. So the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
