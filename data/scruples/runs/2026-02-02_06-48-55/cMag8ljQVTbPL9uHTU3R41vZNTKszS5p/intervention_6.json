Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being annoyed by their girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is 20, healthy, and they've been together a year. She goes to the bathroom often during drives, shopping, movies, even during intimate moments. The author feels it's inconvenient and is annoyed, wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the constant interruptions are wearing on their patience. But the girlfriend is healthy, so there's no medical condition causing this. However, maybe there's an underlying issue they haven't mentioned? Or maybe she's drinking a lot of fluids without realizing it? The author speculates she might be doing it to annoy them, which is a red flag. Assuming malintent without evidence can be harmful.\n\nNow, the author's reaction: being annoyed is understandable, but the way they're handling it is problematic. They're questioning if their girlfriend is trying to annoy them, which is a projection. Instead of addressing the issue constructively, they're considering not talking to her about their feelings because they're worried they're the asshole. That's avoiding communication.\n\nThe girlfriend's needs are basic human functions. Everyone uses the bathroom. The author is expecting her to limit her bathroom breaks, which is unreasonable. Maybe they need to adjust their expectations and plan accordingly. If the girlfriend isn't open to discussing or finding solutions (like planning stops during drives, using the bathroom before outings), then it's up to the author to adapt.\n\nBut the core issue is the author's frustration. They love their partner, yet their annoyance is leading to resentment. The problem might be that the author isn't considering that this is a normal bodily function and that their expectations are too high. They might need to communicate their feelings without blaming the girlfriend, perhaps suggesting practical solutions rather than getting upset.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not necessarily wrong for feeling annoyed, but they're wrong in not addressing the issue properly. By not discussing it openly and instead internalizing the frustration, they're letting it fester. The key is whether the author is being understanding and finding ways to accommodate their partner's needs. Since they're considering not talking about it because they fear being the asshole, that shows a lack of willingness to address the issue collaboratively. That approach could harm the relationship, making the author the asshole for not handling it maturely.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they're not addressing the situation constructively and are projecting negative intentions onto their partner without evidence.\n"
