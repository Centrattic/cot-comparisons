Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. First, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend is 20, healthy, and they've been together for a year. The author mentions several instances where her needing the bathroom causes inconvenience.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the frequency of bathroom breaks and the author's frustration. The question is whether his annoyance makes him the asshole. Well, it's important to consider if there's an underlying medical issue. The girlfriend is described as healthy, but maybe she isn't drinking enough water, or maybe she's drinking too much caffeine? Or perhaps she has a medical condition they haven't discussed yet. If it's a medical problem, the author's annoyance might be less justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's perfectly healthy and there's no medical cause, then the author might have a valid concern. But is it reasonable to be annoyed to this extent? The author mentions situations like driving, shopping, dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments. That seems like a lot, but maybe it's normal? Wait, how often do people typically need to go? If she's going more than average, maybe the author is overreacting. But if it's just within normal range, he's being picky.\n\nAlso, the author's tone suggests he feels guilty for being annoyed. He's conflicted because he loves her but is frustrated. Is it fair to expect someone to adjust their habits when they can't control it? If she can't help it, then his annoyance might be misplaced. But if he's finding it disruptive, maybe they need to talk about it and find compromises, rather than just being annoyed.\n\nAnother angle: the author is considering not mentioning it to her. That could be a red flag. If something is bothering him enough to post online, maybe he should address it with her instead of keeping it bottled up. However, the way he's presenting the problem might show a lack of empathy. He's questioning if she's doing it to annoy him, which could be unfair. Assuming she's trying to be difficult isn't a good approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If there's no medical issue, maybe he's being unreasonable. But if there's an actual problem that they haven't addressed, perhaps she's also not communicating her needs. The answer might depend on whether there's an underlying cause. Since the post states she's \"perfectly healthy,\" maybe the author is overreacting. But the frequency he's describing might be normal. It's hard to say without more info. However, in terms of being an asshole, if he's annoyed without a valid reason and isn't trying to understand, he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the issue is real and they need to find a solution together, maybe not.\n"
