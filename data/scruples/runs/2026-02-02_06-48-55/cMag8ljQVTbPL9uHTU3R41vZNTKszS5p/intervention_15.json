At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, they've been together almost a year and living together for two months. He loves her but is annoyed because she uses the bathroom a lot, which is causing inconveniences. Examples include needing to stop driving every two hours, interrupting shopping, dinner, and even sleep. He's concerned about whether he's being unreasonable for feeling annoyed, especially since she's healthy and 20 years old. He's even wondering if she's doing it to annoy him. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for being annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: he's expressing frustration about frequent bathroom breaks disrupting their activities. On the other hand, the girlfriend's side: she might have a medical issue, or maybe a habit, but the author mentions she's healthy. However, peeing frequently can be a symptom of something like diabetes, UTI, or overactive bladder, even if she's young. But the author says she's healthy, so maybe not. But he's not sure, and he's considering she might be doing it on purpose, which is a bad assumption.\n\nNow, the key factors here. The author is annoyed by something that seems to be a physical need or habit. He's not attacking her or being cruel, just expressing irritation. But is it reasonable to be annoyed? Well, if his girlfriend's behavior is within normal limits, then maybe he's being too sensitive. However, if her bathroom breaks are excessive and causing significant disruption, maybe there's an issue. But the author hasn't consulted a doctor, so he can't be sure.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author is considering whether to bring it up, which is important. If he's not talking to her about it, he might be avoiding a necessary conversation. But if he does, he should approach it without blame. The problem is, he's already assuming she might be doing it to annoy him, which is a negative assumption that could harm their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction: he's annoyed to the point where it's affecting their activities. But is his annoyance justified? If the frequency is normal, then he's the one being unreasonable. If it's excessive, maybe she needs to address it. But since he mentions she's healthy, maybe there's another reason. However, even normal people need to pee multiple times a day. The question is whether the frequency here is outside the norm. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe author's possible wrongdoings: being judgmental without knowing the full story, assuming the worst (that she's doing it on purpose), not discussing the issue with her, and feeling entitled to have things go his way without considering her needs. On the other hand, if her bathroom use is truly excessive and affecting their life, then he does have valid concerns.\n\nIn terms of social norms, relationships require compromise. If one person's habits are causing consistent disruptions, it's reasonable to talk about it. However, the way he's approaching it (feeling annoyed and thinking she might be doing it to annoy him) could be the issue. The key is whether he's being understanding and trying to find a solution together versus being resentful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's making assumptions and not addressing the issue constructively. However, if his frustration is justified due to her actual excessive bathroom use, then maybe not. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong for being annoyed, and given that his assumptions might be incorrect, he's probably in the wrong for not handling the situation better and for having negative thoughts about her intentions. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
