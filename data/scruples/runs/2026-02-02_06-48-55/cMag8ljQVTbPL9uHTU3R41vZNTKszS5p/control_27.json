Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy in a relationship with a girlfriend he loves. They've been together a year and living together two months. The main issue is that his girlfriend uses the bathroom a lot, which is causing him to feel annoyed. He gives examples like needing to stop during drives, shopping, dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments. He's questioning if he's the asshole for being annoyed, even though he loves her and knows she's healthy.\n\nFirst, I should consider if there's a medical reason. The post says she's 20 and perfectly healthy, so maybe there's no medical issue. But maybe there's something else? The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with her, so maybe he's jumping to conclusions. If she's healthy, then her frequent bathroom breaks could be due to normal habits, like drinking a lot of water, caffeine, or maybe even anxiety. But the author is starting to think she's doing it on purpose to annoy him. That's a red flag because assuming malice can be toxic in a relationship.\n\nThe author is feeling inconvenienced. Is it reasonable to be annoyed? Well, if someone is constantly interrupting activities, that could be frustrating. But relationships require compromise. However, the key here is communication. The author hasn't talked to her about his feelings. Instead, he's internalizing it and considering if he's the asshole. If he hasn't discussed it with her, he might be projecting his annoyance without understanding her side.\n\nAlso, the way he's thinking she might be doing it to annoy him is a bit suspicious. That suggests he's not trusting her, which can be a problem. In a healthy relationship, you talk about issues instead of letting them fester. He might need to approach her with empathy, maybe ask if she's drinking too much or if there's a reason for the frequent bathroom use. If there isn't a medical issue, then maybe they can find a middle ground, like planning trips with bathroom stops in mind, or adjusting their schedules.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he hasn't communicated, then he's not necessarily wrong for feeling annoyed, but it's his approach (not talking to her) that's problematic. However, the subreddit usually judges based on the actions and if someone is being unreasonable. The author is expressing his feelings, but if the girlfriend's behavior is normal and he's just not adjusting, then maybe he's the one being difficult. On the other hand, if she's genuinely not causing issues intentionally, and he's being inconsiderate by not discussing it, he might be in the wrong.\n\nBut the post is asking if he's the asshole for being annoyed. In the AITA format, the community often looks at whether the person's reaction is justified. If the girlfriend's bathroom trips are within normal limits and the author is overreacting, then he might be the asshole. However, if the frequency is abnormal and he's right to be concerned, maybe not. But since the post states she's healthy, it's probably a normal habit. So his annoyance is unreasonable, and he's the asshole for not addressing it with her and assuming negative intent.\n"
