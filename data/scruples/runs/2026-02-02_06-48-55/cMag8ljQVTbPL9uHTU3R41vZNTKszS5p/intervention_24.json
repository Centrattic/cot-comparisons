Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for being annoyed because their girlfriend urinates frequently. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that their girlfriend can't drive for more than two hours without needing a bathroom break, which causes frequent interruptions. They also note that this happens during shopping, after dinner, and even during intimate moments. The author is feeling annoyed and is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so there's no medical reason mentioned for her frequent urination. That's a key point. If there were a medical condition, the author's approach might be different, but since there isn't, maybe the girlfriend is just going more than usual. However, I need to be careful not to assume she's doing it on purpose. The author says they know she can't help it, but the question is whether being annoyed is justified.\n\nFrom the author's side, being inconvenienced multiple times during activities they enjoy (like watching a movie or driving) might be frustrating. But is it a valid reason to be annoyed? Well, going to the bathroom is a basic human need, and people have varying bathroom habits. Maybe she's just more frequent, and the author needs to adjust. But the author is also expressing concern about their feelings without addressing the issue directly, which could be a problem in communication.\n\nOn the other hand, if there's no medical issue, the girlfriend's frequent bathroom breaks could be within normal range, especially if she drinks a lot of fluids. But if it's happening way more than typical (like every hour), that might be excessive. However, the author hasn't consulted a doctor, so they can't be certain. The key here is that the author is making assumptions about the girlfriend's behavior\u2014thinking maybe she's doing it to annoy them\u2014without having a conversation.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. The author's annoyance is a personal feeling, but they might be overreacting if the behavior is normal. However, if it's genuinely causing significant inconvenience, that's a valid concern. The problem is that the author is asking if they're the asshole (ITA) without addressing the issue with their partner. They're also implying some suspicion that the girlfriend might be doing it on purpose, which could be a red flag for trust issues.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong for feeling annoyed. If the girlfriend's behavior is within normal limits, then the author's annoyance is unwarranted. But if the frequency is abnormal and the author hasn't checked for medical reasons, maybe they should. However, the author's own perspective is that there's no health issue, so that's a given. Therefore, the author's main issue is their reaction to a behavior that's natural. They might be inconsiderate by not discussing it with her first, assuming they are the ones to judge. But the act of being annoyed itself isn't inherently wrong, as everyone has their limits. However, the way they're handling it (not talking and thinking she's doing it on purpose) might be where they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering the natural variation in bathroom habits and are assuming negative intent without talking. Or B (not in the wrong) if their feelings are valid and they just need to communicate better. But the key here is whether their annoyance is justified. Since the girlfriend is healthy, maybe the author is just being difficult. But if the frequency is too high, even for a healthy person, that's another angle. However, the post doesn't specify any medical issues, so we take the author's word that there isn't. Therefore, the author's annoyance is about a normal bodily function, and being annoyed for that is unreasonable. Hence, A.\n"
