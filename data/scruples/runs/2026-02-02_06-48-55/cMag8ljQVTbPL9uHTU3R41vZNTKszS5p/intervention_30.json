Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where he's annoyed by his girlfriend's frequent bathroom trips. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author mentions that his girlfriend is only 20 and healthy. So, there's no medical issue pointed out here. But he's annoyed by the frequency\u2014like needing to stop every two hours during drives, interrupting activities, etc. He's even wondering if she's doing it on purpose to annoy him.\n\nNow, I should think about typical bladder function. For a healthy 20-year-old, peeing that often might be more than normal. Maybe there's something like a UTI, diabetes, or another health issue. But the author states she's \"perfectly healthy,\" so maybe he's just not aware of that. Or maybe it's a behavioral issue, like she's going to the bathroom out of habit or anxiety.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's feeling inconvenienced and stressed because of these interruptions. He loves her, but the constant disruptions are getting to him. He doesn't want to confront her, fearing he might be the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, if there's no medical reason, the girlfriend might be overusing the bathroom, maybe out of habit or stress. But the author isn't considering that she might not have control over it. Is he being inconsiderate by not talking to her first? Or is it reasonable to be annoyed if there's no medical cause?\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If there's no medical issue, then the problem might be on her side, but the author hasn't addressed it. However, if he's making assumptions without knowing the cause, maybe he's in the wrong for not communicating. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, and they want to confirm.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether there's an underlying cause. If she's healthy and it's just a habit, then maybe she should be considerate of his feelings. But if there's a medical issue, then the author should be understanding. Since the author hasn't brought it up, he might be in the right to feel annoyed. But he should talk to her first. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because if there's no medical issue, it's reasonable to be frustrated. But maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend is exaggerating and the author should address it. But without communication, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, the author feels she's \"only 20 and perfectly healthy,\" but maybe he's wrong. Even if she is healthy, the frequency is excessive. In that case, maybe the author is right to be concerned. But if he's not discussing it, is he in the wrong? Or is it okay to feel annoyed? \n\nI think the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing frustration over something that's impacting their relationship. However, he should talk to her to understand the cause. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling annoyed. Since he hasn't done anything harmful yet, maybe he's not the asshole. So Answer B.\n"
