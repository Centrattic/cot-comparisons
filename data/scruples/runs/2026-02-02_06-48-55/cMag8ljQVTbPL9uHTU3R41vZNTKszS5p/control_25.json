Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don\u2019t want to mention it to her that it\u2019s annoying me if I am the asshole here. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being annoyed because their girlfriend uses the bathroom a lot. They mention that it's causing inconvenience in various aspects of their life, like driving, shopping, dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for being annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20 and healthy, so maybe there's no medical issue causing the frequent bathroom breaks. But the author is expressing frustration about the constant interruptions. Now, is it reasonable for the author to feel this way? Well, everyone has different thresholds for irritation. If the girlfriend isn't doing anything wrong, like if she's genuinely needing to pee, then the author's frustration might stem from their own impatience rather than the girlfriend's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is healthy and there's no medical reason, perhaps there's a behavior pattern that could be adjusted. However, the author is the one feeling annoyed, not the girlfriend. The key question is whether the author is being unreasonable. The girlfriend isn't intentionally causing harm, she's just meeting her bodily needs. The author's annoyance might be a personal issue rather than the girlfriend doing something objectively wrong.\n\nBut wait, the author might not be the asshole because they're expressing a genuine feeling of being inconvenienced. However, they should consider discussing it with her in a non-accusatory way to find a solution, rather than just being annoyed. If the author doesn't confront the issue, it could build up into a bigger problem. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but they might need to address it constructively. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overreacting. If the girlfriend is healthy and not being careless, then the author's frustration is perhaps misplaced. So the answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction is reasonable. If there's no medical cause, maybe the author should adjust their expectations, as people have different bathroom needs. \n\nHmm, but the author also mentions they love their girlfriend and don't want to accuse her of being annoying. It sounds like they're struggling with their own feelings. In terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the asshole for feeling annoyed, but they should communicate their feelings to find a mutual solution. The girlfriend isn't doing anything objectively wrong, so the author's annoyance is their own issue to handle. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
