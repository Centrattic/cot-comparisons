I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can\u2019t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we\u2019re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we\u2019re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she\u2019ll get up while I\u2019m sleeping etc etc. I know she can\u2019t help it, and she\u2019s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it\u2019s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we\u2019re watching or something she\u2019ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don\u2019t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that his girlfriend goes to the bathroom a lot. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author are in a committed relationship, living together for two months. The author is annoyed by her frequent bathroom breaks. He lists several situations: long drives, shopping, dinner, and even during movies or intimate moments. He acknowledges she's healthy and 20, but it's still bothering him. He's wondering if he's the asshole for feeling this way.\n\nHmm. On one hand, going to the bathroom is a basic human need. If she's healthy, then her frequent urination might just be her body's natural function. Maybe she drinks a lot of fluids, which is common. But the author is getting annoyed to the point where he's considering if she's doing it on purpose. That's a red flag because it implies a lack of trust, which can be harmful in a relationship.\n\nBut then again, relationships require mutual consideration. If her bathroom breaks are indeed causing significant inconvenience, maybe there's a way to address it without resentment. However, the author is framing it as annoyance rather than a serious problem. He's not suggesting she has a medical issue but is frustrated by the frequency. \n\nThe key points here are empathy and communication. The author should consider her perspective. Maybe she's doing her best, and it's not something she can control. Also, his frustration might be valid, but how he handles it matters. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling annoyed. Feeling annoyed isn't inherently wrong, but the way he's thinking about it\u2014possibly doubting her motives or not discussing it respectfully\u2014could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not accusing her of a medical problem but is still annoyed. That could indicate that the issue is more about his own impatience or expectations rather than her actions. In that case, he might need to adjust his expectations or find ways to accommodate her needs without letting it build up frustration. However, if the frequency is truly excessive and affecting their quality time, maybe there's a legitimate concern. But since she's deemed healthy, it's probably within normal limits.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both partners should make space for each other's needs. If the author is feeling this way, the right approach would be to talk to her calmly instead of internalizing it. But the fact that he's considering if she's doing it to annoy him suggests he's projecting his own frustrations onto her, which is unwise.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's being judgmental or dismissive of her basic needs, then yes. But if he's just expressing a valid concern about how it affects their activities, maybe not. However, the tone here leans towards him being annoyed without considering her perspective, which could make him the asshole. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not approaching the problem with empathy and is possibly misinterpreting her actions.\n"
