I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The situation involves personal feelings, societal pressures, and political tensions.\n\nFirst, the author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met an Israeli girl, Maya, through friends. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They had some one-on-one time, but when she wanted an actual date, he hesitated. He rejected her because he's concerned about societal acceptance and the political conflict between their countries. He mentions that their families would disapprove and that society wouldn't accept their relationship.\n\nNow, I need to decide if he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and the practical issues. He's a 17-year-old dealing with real-world pressures. On the other hand, Maya might feel rejected based on her identity rather than his personal feelings towards her. It could be seen as unfair if he's more conflicted about the political aspect than about Maya herself. But he also clarifies that he wants a relationship where marriage is possible, which he thinks isn't feasible here. So, maybe he's not being malicious, just practical. However, the question is whether it's ethical to reject someone based on factors outside their control, like nationality. \n\nIn some contexts, people make choices based on cultural or familial expectations. But others might argue that personal feelings shouldn't be dictated by external pressures. The key here is whether his rejection is based on her as a person or the political situation. If he genuinely believes that societal and familial disapproval would make a relationship unsustainable, then his decision might be seen as pragmatic. However, if he's letting fear of others' opinions dictate his own happiness, that could be the issue. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent. If he's rejecting her because of the conflict between their countries rather than personal incompatibility, that's a judgment call. But since he mentions that he likes her and they had fun, it's more about external factors. In that case, he's not necessarily in the wrong for being realistic. But some might argue that he's avoiding taking a stand for love. However, given his age and the complexities involved, maybe it's reasonable to see him as not the asshole. So, leaning towards answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
