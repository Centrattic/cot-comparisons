I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who formed a friendship with a group including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, Maya expressed interest, and the author considered dating her but ultimately rejected her due to societal and political tensions between their countries. He cites family and societal disapproval, and his desire for a potential marriage.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author's reasons are based on societal pressures and family expectations. He's being honest about his stance, which is that he doesn't see a future with someone from an \"enemy\" nation. But does that make him an asshole?\n\nIn many cultures, relationships between people from conflicting groups are controversial. However, the question is whether the author is wrong. He's not forcing her or being cruel; he's expressing his personal beliefs and fears about societal acceptance. Maya's family also disapproves, so there's mutual tension. \n\nBut some might argue that he's letting external factors dictate his personal choices, potentially hurting Maya's feelings. However, he's also being honest about his values. It's a tough balance. The author isn't acting out of malice but out of concern for his own and his family's approval. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's subjective. From a personal ethics standpoint, he's not wrong for choosing not to pursue something he believes is impossible. However, if the question is about fairness to Maya, there's a case that he could have been more considerate, but the scenario doesn't indicate he was dismissive or hurtful. He considered her and then made a difficult decision. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's being truthful and considering the realities he's aware of. Society's expectations are part of the context here, and he's making a choice based on his own values and the potential challenges. However, there's nuance. Some might say he should try to be open-minded regardless, but that's more of an opinion than a right/wrong judgment.\n"
