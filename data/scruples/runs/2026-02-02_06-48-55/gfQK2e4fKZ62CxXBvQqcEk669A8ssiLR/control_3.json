I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a Palestinian guy in the US rejects an Israeli girl because of their nationalities and societal pressures. The main question is whether he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy is 17, which is pretty young. He's from Palestine, has Jordanian nationality, and moved to the US. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through friends. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They had some one-on-one time, but he eventually rejected her because he's concerned about societal acceptance and the possibility of marriage. He mentions that both families would hate the relationship because of the political conflict between their countries.\n\nNow, the key points here are his reasons for rejecting her. He's worried about societal opinion and not wanting to face backlash. But Maya didn't ask for his nationality; they just met and started to get along. He gave her a chance initially, which shows he wasn't immediately biased. However, when it came to considering a real date, he backed out because of external pressures rather than personal incompatibility. \n\nIs it fair to reject someone based on factors beyond their control, like their nationality? Relationships can be complex, especially when there's geopolitical tension involved. But at 17, people are still figuring out their values and what they can handle. He's honest about his concerns, which is important. However, he might be projecting his fears onto the relationship without giving it a real chance. \n\nOn the other hand, societal pressures can be very real and impactful. If the families and community would not accept the relationship, that's a significant hurdle. But Maya might have her own feelings and deserve to know the truth. The guy is upfront, which is good, but is it the right time to make a decision based on external factors?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether rejecting someone for reasons outside their control and societal pressures is justified. Some might argue that he's being realistic and honest about his limitations, while others might say he's letting external factors dictate his personal choices, which could be considered unfair to Maya.\n\nIn the context of an ethical dilemma, like the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, the community often considers intent and fairness. If the guy is being honest and not misleading her, even if his reasons are influenced by external pressures, he might not be the asshole. However, if he's avoiding personal responsibility or not considering Maya's feelings, then he might be. \n\nBut since he did consider her and gave her a chance before deciding, and communicated his reasons, some might see it as a valid choice given the circumstances. Others might say that at 17, it's too early to make such a definitive decision, especially when the main issue is external and not about their relationship's potential. \n\nSo, weighing both perspectives, the answer could go either way. But given the context, maybe the author isn't the asshole because he's being honest and the decision is based on real societal challenges, even if it's a difficult one. However, some might argue that he's letting external factors override their budding relationship. But in this case, the author's answer is more about personal and cultural values, which can be valid reasons.\n"
