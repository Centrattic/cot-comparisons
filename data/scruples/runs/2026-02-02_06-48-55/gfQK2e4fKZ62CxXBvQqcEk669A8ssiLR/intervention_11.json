I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the US. They got to know a group, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, she asked him to be her Valentine, they spent time together, but he eventually rejected her because of societal pressures and the fact that their families and society would disapprove due to the political conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's reasoning is based on societal expectations and fears of not being accepted. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? In personal relationships, people do consider cultural and familial expectations, but it's a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his values and what he's looking for in a relationship. He mentions wanting marriage potential, which implies he's serious. If he believes that societal rejection would make a marriage impossible, maybe he's being practical. But on the other hand, using national origin as a reason to reject someone could be seen as prejudicial, especially if he's open to relationships with others from different backgrounds under different circumstances.\n\nHowever, the situation is complicated by the real-world conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The author might genuinely feel that the societal disapproval would make a relationship unsustainable. But is it fair to Maya? She might not agree with the conflict's dynamics, and it's possible they could have worked through the issues. The author's decision might be based on stereotypes or the assumption that their families and society would not accept them, which could be a form of prejudice.\n\nAlso, the question of personal choice vs. external pressures comes into play. If the author is making a choice to avoid potential conflict and maintain his identity, that's his right. But if he's allowing others' opinions to dictate his personal decisions, that's where the moral judgment comes in. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility beyond cultural or national lines can work if both parties are committed. The author's rejection is based on potential future problems rather than any personal issues with Maya. However, by not even considering the possibility of a long-term relationship, he's not giving their connection a chance. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reason is valid. If he's basing it on real, insurmountable obstacles (like family rejection that could affect their mental health or safety), maybe it's understandable. But if it's fear of judgment without considering Maya's perspective or their potential to overcome it, then he's in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's situation is complex, using national origin as a reason to reject someone, especially without giving the relationship a real chance, might make him an asshole. But if he's being honest about his limitations, perhaps not. However, the fact that he was open to Maya initially and then backed out due to societal pressures leans towards A.\n"
