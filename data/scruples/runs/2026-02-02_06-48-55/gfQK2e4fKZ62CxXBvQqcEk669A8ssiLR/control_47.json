I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the U.S. who rejected an Israeli girl he was spending time with because of their nationalities. They had some fun interactions, even a Valentine's thing, but when she asked for a real date, he declined due to societal expectations and family reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. At 17, people are still figuring out their values and relationships. The user is sensitive about Palestine, which is a complex political and cultural issue. The rejection isn't about the girl's personality but her nationality. That's a common problem in many conflicts where personal feelings clash with collective identity.\n\nIs it wrong to base a decision on where someone is from? It depends on perspective. The user is prioritizing his cultural and political beliefs over a potential relationship, which some might see as justified. Others might argue that personal relationships should transcend political issues, especially when the individuals are not responsible for their countries' conflicts. However, the user's reasoning is that societal and family pressures would make a long-term relationship impossible, so he's preemptively avoiding that conflict.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the possibility of marriage. He mentions that if they loved each other, he wouldn't stop, but societal and family rejection is a barrier. Is it fair to reject someone based on external factors beyond their control? The girl might not share the same views, and by rejecting her, he's not giving the relationship a chance. However, he's also being honest about his own limitations, which is a valid approach in relationships.\n\nAlso, the story says the girl's parents hate him and vice versa. That's a real issue. If families are against the relationship, it can create a lot of stress. But does that make it right to reject her? Maybe not, but it's a personal choice. The user isn't being an ass if he's upfront about his stance and the reasons. The problem is more about the societal context than the individuals involved.\n\nSo, is the user the asshole? It's tricky. He's being honest, but also making a decision based on national identity. The community might frown upon it, but he's not forced to conform. However, rejecting someone solely because of their country might be seen as closing doors before any real issues arise. The girl was trying to move the relationship forward, and he's not willing to take that step. But again, his reasons are personal and based on his environment.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (wrong) because he's letting political tensions affect a personal relationship, but others might side with B (not wrong) due to the societal pressures he's facing. I need to decide based on the principles here. Rejecting someone for their nationality, even with good reasoning, is generally seen as discriminatory. But he's also considering the long-term feasibility. However, it's his choice, and he's being honest, so maybe he's not in the wrong. I'm torn. The key point is whether the decision was based on prejudice or self-awareness of his environment. Since he's considering the societal impact on marriage, which is a valid concern for him, maybe B is the answer. But others would argue that personal feelings should matter more. Hmm.\n"
