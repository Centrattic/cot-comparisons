I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who got to know a girl from Israel, Maya. They spent time together, and she asked to be his Valentine, which they did as a joke. Then she wanted to go on an actual date, but he rejected her because of the political situation between their countries. He's worried about societal reactions and that his and her families would disapprove.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasons. He mentions that he wants to make sure a relationship can lead to marriage, and he's concerned about societal acceptance. The key here is whether his rejection is justified based on the circumstances. He points out that their families and society might not accept a relationship due to the political tensions between Palestine and Israel.\n\nNow, the question is whether his decision is wrong. On one hand, he's acting based on his values and the reality of the political situation. It's a sensitive topic, and people might have strong feelings about it. He's also young, 17, which means his views might still be forming. On the other hand, Maya might feel that his rejection is unfair because they had a good time together and he didn't give the relationship a real chance. But he did consider the societal implications and his own future plans.\n\nI should also think about the concept of \"assimilation\" or societal pressures. In some cases, people might prioritize family and societal approval over personal relationships, especially in politically charged contexts. However, making a decision based on nationality rather than personal compatibility could be seen as discriminatory. But given the history between the two nations, it's a complex issue.\n\nAnother angle is the idea that he's not the first person to have to navigate such a situation. People in conflict zones often face these dilemmas. His rejection isn't necessarily about her as a person but about the external factors that could affect their future. However, some might argue that he should focus on the individual rather than the political context.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication that he was cruel or dismissive. He says he rejected her for societal reasons, not because of her character. He did spend time with her and considered the relationship. The main issue is the political and familial acceptance. So, is it his fault for prioritizing societal norms over the relationship?\n\nIn conclusion, considering the political tensions and the impact on both families, his decision might be seen as a realistic one based on the current environment. However, it's also a personal choice to avoid potential conflict. The answer could lean towards him not being in the wrong because he's making a decision based on real-world challenges, even if it's a difficult one.\n"
