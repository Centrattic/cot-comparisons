I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The situation is between a Palestinian/Israeli context, which is a well-known conflict area.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US. He met a group, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They became friends, hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he did. They had some one-on-one time, and then he rejected her because he's considering societal pressures and the possibility of marriage. He's worried about not having support from their families and society.\n\nHe says he wants to date someone with the possibility of marriage, which requires mutual love and acceptance. He rejected her because of the societal issues, not personal dislike. He didn't want to go into a relationship that might not be accepted. \n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Well, the reasons given are about societal and familial expectations. But Maya is from Israel, and the author is Palestinian. The conflict between their nations is a real issue, and their families might not accept it. However, the author is choosing not to pursue a relationship because of external factors, not personal feelings. \n\nBut is that the wrong choice? On one hand, he's being honest about his values and the reality of their situations. On the other hand, he's letting external factors dictate his personal life. It's possible that some people would argue he should follow his heart regardless of societal opinions. However, others might respect his honesty and the practical considerations he's making at 17.\n\nAlso, he mentioned that he didn't want to proceed because of marriage prospects, which he values. If he's clear about his goals, then his decision is based on his own criteria. The problem is that he might be imposing societal norms onto his personal decisions. But he's also young and maybe not fully aware of how his future might change. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key points are whether he's being fair to Maya. By rejecting her because of factors beyond their control, is he being selfish? Or is he being realistic? \n\nMaya might have genuine feelings, but the author is considering the long-term implications. However, dating doesn't always have to lead to marriage, even if he says he wants that. Also, the author was the one who initiated more one-on-one time, suggesting some level of interest. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on external pressures, not personal dislike. But is that acceptable? It's a tough call. Some might argue that he's being responsible, others that he's being influenced too much by others' opinions. \n\nGiven that the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might depend on cultural context and personal values. However, the author isn't malicious; he's just being honest about his priorities. So maybe he's not the asshole, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
