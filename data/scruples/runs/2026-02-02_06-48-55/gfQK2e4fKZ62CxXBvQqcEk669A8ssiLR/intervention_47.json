I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl because she's from Israel. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through school friends. They hung out, had some fun, and she asked to be his Valentine. He said yes for a joke, they hung out more, and then he rejected her because of societal pressures and the political situation between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he's sensitive about Palestine and that their families would hate each other. He's concerned about societal acceptance and potential backlash from others. But is that a valid reason to reject someone?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is rejecting another person solely based on their nationality or the political conflict between their countries, that could be seen as discriminatory. Maya is an individual, not a political symbol. The author is making a choice based on the conflict between nations rather than the person's character. However, the author also mentions that he's 17 and from a place where societal opinions might heavily influence personal decisions. At 17, he's still forming his views, and the societal pressure is real in that situation.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might have been willing to give the relationship a chance. The author is considering the possibility of marriage and long-term acceptance, which is understandable. But by rejecting her upfront, he's not even giving the relationship a chance. The question is whether his decision is justified based on societal norms or if it's a personal choice that's unfair to Maya.\n\nIn many cases, people choose partners regardless of such conflicts, so the author's decision could be seen as avoiding a potential conflict in his life. However, the problem is that he's rejecting her based on her nationality, not any personal flaws. That's a form of discrimination. But is he in the wrong for making a choice that's influenced by his environment and upbringing?\n\nI think the key here is whether the rejection is based on legitimate incompatibility or just societal pressures. Since the author is considering a possible future marriage and societal acceptance, he might be acting out of fear or external pressures rather than personal incompatibility with Maya. That could make him the asshole because he's not giving the relationship a fair chance. Alternatively, if the conflict is too much for him to handle personally, maybe it's not his fault. But the main issue is the nationality-based rejection without considering the individual's merits.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the decision is based on the person's identity alone, which is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
