I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who got close to an Israeli girl named Maya. He ended up rejecting her because of the political tensions between their countries. He mentions societal disapproval from both sides, and his parents' disapproval. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and political contexts. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is deeply rooted and impacts personal relationships. In many cases, people from these regions face societal pressures. The author is worried about family and societal acceptance, which is a real concern. However, personal choice in relationships is also important. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he can't see a future with Maya because of societal rejection. But is it fair to reject someone solely because of their nationality? On one hand, he's being honest about his limitations. On the other hand, he might be using the conflict as an excuse to avoid commitment, possibly out of fear or lack of personal conviction. \n\nMaya's perspective matters too. She might have felt hurt by the rejection, especially if she was serious about the relationship. The fact that he went on \"fake dates\" could imply he wasn't fully committed from the start, which complicates things. \n\nBut in many cultures, family approval and societal norms are significant factors. The author is being upfront about his stance, which is better than leading someone on. However, the question is whether it's the right decision. \n\nSome might argue that relationships should be based on mutual feelings and not external factors. Others might respect his honesty and the reality of the situation. The key is whether the rejection is justified given the circumstances. \n\nSince he's 17, maybe he's not fully aware of the complexities. But he made a decision based on his values and environment. The answer hinges on whether societal pressures are a valid reason to end a relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are understandable given the context, the decision is morally ambiguous. However, given the societal pressures and his honesty, he might not be in the wrong. But there's also a case for personal choice over external factors. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's acting based on his beliefs and the reality of his environment.\n"
