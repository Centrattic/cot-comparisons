I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong by rejecting the Israeli girl because of their nationalities. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality living in the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They started hanging out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he did, but only as a joke. They had some fun, and when she wanted a real date, he said he needed time to think. Eventually, he rejected her because he doesn't think their relationship would be accepted due to the political situation between Palestine and Israel.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider a few things. On one hand, he's being honest about his concerns. He mentions that their families and society might not accept the relationship because of the political tensions. He also mentions that others would look shocked and call him a traitor. That's a real issue in their cultural context. He's not just rejecting her for superficial reasons; it's a matter of societal and familial pressure, which can be significant.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya is an individual, and the user is choosing her nationality over her as a person. He admits she's funny, outgoing, and pretty. By rejecting her based on national identity, he's prioritizing the conflict between their countries over his personal feelings. But he also says he's looking for a potential marriage partner where both families accept them. That's his personal standard, and he's being honest about his limitations.\n\nIs it wrong to base a decision on societal and familial acceptance? In some contexts, people do consider family approval when choosing a partner. However, if he's not willing to stand up for his feelings and face any backlash, that could be seen as a problem. But given the intensity of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the pressure from both sides could be immense. He's a teenager, so his perspective might be influenced by the ongoing conflict and the expectations of his community.\n\nAnother angle: he gave her a chance. He didn't immediately reject her but spent time getting to know her. That shows he wasn't just judging her on nationality upfront. When he realized the societal implications, he made a conscious decision that he couldn't proceed, which is honest. But some might argue that he didn't give her a real chance because he was already biased against her nationality from the start. However, he did say he was skeptical but gave her a chance anyway.\n\nAlso, considering the age aspect. At 17, his views might still be forming. He might not be ready to challenge societal norms yet. It's possible that he's making a decision based on fear of rejection from his community rather than his own feelings. But he's also being realistic about the challenges they would face.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is being honest about his limitations and the societal pressures he faces. He's not in the wrong for making a decision based on his current beliefs and the reality of their situation. However, some might argue that he could have tried to work through the issues instead of giving up. But given the context, his decision might be understandable.\n"
