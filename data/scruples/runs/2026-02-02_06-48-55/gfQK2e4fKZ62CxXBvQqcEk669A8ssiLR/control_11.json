I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now in the US. He's involved with a girl from Israel, Maya, and they've been hanging out. He's rejecting her because of their national backgrounds, saying society won't accept it. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the user is conflicted. He liked Maya, found her fun, but societal pressures and family reactions are causing him to back out. He mentions that both families would hate the relationship. He's worried about others' opinions and the possibility of marriage because of the political conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he's giving. He's rejecting her due to societal and familial disapproval, not because of any personal dislike of Maya. He's worried about others' reactions, not her character. But the key point is whether his decision is justified.\n\nIn terms of morality, personal choice is usually respected, but relationships can be influenced by external factors. However, if he's not personally against her as a person but is letting others' opinions dictate his actions, that could be seen as a problem. On the other hand, he's young and might be considering practical aspects like family acceptance and societal judgment, which are real-world factors.\n\nBut wait, is it right to let society influence a personal relationship? If he's not in love with her but is letting others' views affect his decision, maybe he's in the right. However, if he's choosing not to pursue a relationship based on national identity, that's a form of prejudice, even if it's societal pressure. He's choosing against a relationship not based on her actions but her nationality, which is a sensitive issue given the conflict.\n\nThe user is considering marriage and long-term commitment, so he's evaluating compatibility. If he doesn't think it's viable due to external factors, maybe he's making a realistic choice. But the question is about being an asshole. Being an asshole would imply he's being inconsiderate or unjustified in his decision. Since he's being honest about his concerns and isn't hurting her without reason, maybe he's not the asshole. However, if he's aware of the political tensions and is using that as an excuse instead of confronting them, perhaps he is.\n\nBut the user is also a teenager, so his perspective might be more influenced by his immediate environment. He's making a decision based on his values and circumstances. So, depending on the viewpoint, he could be seen as not in the wrong because he's being truthful about his limitations.\n"
