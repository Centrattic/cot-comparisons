I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their national backgrounds. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality in the US. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through friends. They hung out, had fun, and she asked to be his Valentine. He went along, but when she wanted a real date, he rejected her, citing societal disapproval and the impossibility of a lasting relationship due to the political tensions between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. At 17, emotions and social pressures can be intense. The author is dealing with cultural and political issues, which are significant. However, the rejection is based on nationality rather than personal issues. Maya is described as kind and they had a good time together. The author's main reason is societal expectations and the impossibility of marriage because of their backgrounds.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his stance on the political conflict. He's clear that his values and the expectations of his community prevent him from pursuing a relationship. That's a personal choice. On the other hand, rejecting someone solely based on their nationality, especially when they have a good personal connection, might be seen as prejudiced. It's not about Maya as a person but her origin, which could be considered discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others in his community would disapprove, but that doesn't necessarily make his decision right. People have the right to make personal choices, but when those choices are based on prejudice, it can be problematic. The key point is whether the rejection was based on valid personal reasons or unfounded bias. Since the author acknowledges the potential for a good relationship but chooses against it due to external societal pressures, it might be seen as him prioritizing external opinions over personal feelings. However, his stance is rooted in a real and complex political situation, which adds nuance.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person is being fair and honest. The author is upfront about his reasons, which is important. But the question is whether it's fair to reject someone based on factors beyond their control. The answer might depend on cultural context and individual perspectives. In this case, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his values and circumstances, even if others might disagree.\n"
