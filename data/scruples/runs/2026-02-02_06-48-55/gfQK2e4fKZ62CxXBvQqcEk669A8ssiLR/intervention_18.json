I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who got close to an Israeli girl named Maya. They had some fun hangouts, and she asked him to be her Valentine. They even hugged and hung out a few times. He considered a real date but decided to reject her because of the political situation between their countries. He's worried about societal backlash and his families' reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if he's in the wrong. The key points here are his reasons for rejecting her. He mentions that he wants to ensure a possible marriage, which he can't do because of societal and familial disapproval. But is that a valid reason to reject someone you're interested in?\n\nIn terms of personal choice and relationships, people often have to consider their values and their families' expectations. However, if the rejection is solely based on national identity without personal issues, it's a bit complex. The user did engage with her, showed interest initially, and then pulled back due to external pressures. That could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if he was leading her on.\n\nOn the other hand, he's 17, which is a young age where people are still figuring out their values. The political tensions between Israel and Palestine are significant, and family pressure can be intense. It's understandable that societal norms might influence his decision. However, if he genuinely cares about her but is afraid of external judgment, that's a personal conflict.\n\nThe question is whether his reason for rejecting her is fair. If he's not willing to face societal backlash and his own family's disapproval, is it fair to start a relationship knowing it's likely to be opposed? But then again, if he's not even willing to try because of that, maybe he's not being true to his feelings.\n\nThere's also the aspect of Maya's feelings. He led her on by agreeing to be her Valentine and hanging out, then rejecting her. That could be hurtful, regardless of the reasons. But given the context, maybe he was being honest when he decided to reject her because he wasn't ready for the consequences.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had communicated his concerns earlier, maybe they could have discussed it. But he waited until after some interactions. So, his actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he didn't address his reservations sooner.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision hinges on whether societal pressures are a valid reason to reject someone. If he's acting out of fear of others' opinions rather than personal issues with her, he might be in the wrong. However, considering the political context and his age, it's a nuanced situation. But given that he was interested enough to spend time with her and then rejected her, it's possible he's in the wrong for not being upfront from the start.\n"
