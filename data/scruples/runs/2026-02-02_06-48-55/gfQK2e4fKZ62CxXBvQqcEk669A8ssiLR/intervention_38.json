I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old from Palestine but with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met a group of friends, including a girl from Israel named Maya. They became friends, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine, which he agreed to for a joke. They hung out a few times, and he even considered an actual date but ended up rejecting her because of their nationalities. He cites societal pressures and the fact that both their families and society would oppose a relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider his reasons. He mentions that he wants to marry someone if they really connect, but because of their countries' political situation, he thinks it's impossible. He also says others would react negatively. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and the challenges they'd face. He didn't lead her on; he said he needed to think and then explained his reasons. On the other hand, he did go on multiple dates with her before deciding, which could be seen as giving false hope. But the dates were \"fake\" at first, so maybe he wasn't intentionally misleading her. \n\nThe key point here is whether rejecting someone based on their nationality and external factors is wrong. While it's true that societal pressures exist, personal beliefs and values can influence decisions. However, dating someone from a different background is a personal choice, and if the author genuinely believes it's not feasible due to his own values or societal expectations, that's his prerogative. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of being honest from the start. If he knew upfront that he couldn't see a future with her because of their nationalities, maybe he should have addressed that earlier. However, he did give her a chance and spent time with her before making his decision. \n\nIn some contexts, rejecting someone for their nationality could be seen as discriminatory. However, the author isn't rejecting all Israelis; it's a specific cultural and political context. It's a complex issue where personal feelings and external pressures intersect. \n\nConsidering that he's 17, he's still forming his views, and it's possible he's influenced by his upbringing and the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. While it's unfortunate that societal issues affect personal relationships, he's not obligated to pursue a relationship if he's not comfortable with the implications. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. If he's being honest about his limitations and not stringing her along, maybe not. But if he's using external factors to avoid confronting his own feelings or the possibility of challenging those societal norms, then perhaps there's room for criticism. However, given the information, he's acting based on his own values and the reality he perceives. Therefore, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
