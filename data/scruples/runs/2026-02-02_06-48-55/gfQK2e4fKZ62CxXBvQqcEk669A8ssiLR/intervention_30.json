I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl due to their nationalities. The author is Palestinian (Jordanian nationality) in the US, and they started hanging out with a group, including Maya, an Israeli girl. They had some fun interactions, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine. He eventually rejected her because of societal pressures and the conflict between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a deeply sensitive and complex issue. The author mentions that their families and society would not accept the relationship. He's young, 17, and possibly influenced by his environment. He also states that he wants to ensure a relationship can lead to marriage, which adds another layer\u2014cultural expectations around marriageability based on nationality.\n\nNow, looking at the question: Is the author in the wrong? The key here is intent. Did he wrong Maya by rejecting her? The rejection is based on political and societal factors beyond their control. However, Maya might have invested feelings, and the rejection could hurt her. But the author is being honest about his concerns and the reality of their situation. He didn't lead her on intentionally; he considered the possibility and decided against it due to external pressures.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is letting external factors dictate his personal choices. However, given the real-world implications (family disapproval, societal judgment), it's a valid concern. The author isn't acting out of malice but out of practicality. Maya initiated the interactions, and the author was clear about his stance after considering the relationship's future.\n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether the rejection is justified given the circumstances. The author isn't being deceptive; he's making a choice based on his values and expectations. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid perspectives, but the author isn't maliciously wrong.\n"
