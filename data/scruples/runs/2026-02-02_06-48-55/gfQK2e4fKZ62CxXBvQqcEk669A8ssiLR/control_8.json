I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now living in the USA. He met a girl named Maya from Israel while making friends at school. They started hanging out as a group, and Maya ended up being really nice and fun. They did some Valentine's stuff as a joke, then started spending more time together. The author liked her a lot but decided to reject her romantic advances because of their nationalities\u2014Palestinian and Israeli. He mentions societal pressures, family reactions, and the idea that nobody would accept such a relationship. His main reason is that he wants to ensure a potential for marriage, which he feels is impossible due to their backgrounds.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for rejecting her because of her nationality?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Rejecting someone based on their nationality can be problematic. It's a form of discrimination. However, the author's reasoning is that societal and familial pressures make a relationship impossible. At 17, he might not have considered all the possibilities, like moving to another country or his family changing their views. Also, the fact that they're from conflicting regions adds complexity. But is that a valid reason to reject someone?\n\nOn one hand, it's true that societal acceptance can influence relationships, and the author is being realistic about the challenges. On the other hand, making a decision based on nationality rather than the person's character could be seen as unfair. Maya was described as kind, funny, and someone he enjoyed being with. The author might be letting political tensions override personal feelings and the possibility of a meaningful relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author is still young, and his perspective on relationships and societal issues might evolve. He might not be ready for a committed relationship, but the reason for rejection is based on nationality rather than personal compatibility. But he did spend time with her, so he found her appealing but still rejected her because of her country.\n\nAlso, the question of free will and personal choice comes into play. While the author has the right to make his own choices, using nationality as a reason could perpetuate stereotypes and conflict. However, the situation is complicated by the historical and political context between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that it's pragmatic to consider real-world challenges, especially if the families are vehemently opposed. But others might say that love and personal happiness should take precedence over external pressures.\n\nI think the key point here is whether the author's decision is based on a valid reason or if it's an excuse to avoid a deeper commitment because of external factors. The author claims he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage, but he's closing the door because of societal reactions. However, the girl's nationality is a factor he can't change, and by rejecting her, he's making a choice that could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his reasons, the primary issue is rejecting someone because of their nationality rather than personal qualities. That's generally considered wrong, so the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
