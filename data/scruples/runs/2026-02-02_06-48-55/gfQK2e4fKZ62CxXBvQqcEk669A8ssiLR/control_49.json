I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the girl from Israel. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he agreed to as a joke. They had some one-on-one time, and she wanted a real date, but he rejected her because of their nationalities and the societal views against their relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's reasons for rejecting Maya. He mentions his sensitivity about Palestine and Israel, societal pressure, and the fact that their families would disapprove. He also says he wants to ensure a possible future marriage if he dates someone. \n\nNow, considering consent and respect. Maya asked him to be her Valentine and wanted to date him, so she had genuine interest. The author's rejection is based on factors beyond their personal feelings. But is that a valid reason? In a dating context, people can have various reasons to reject someone, but if the reason is discriminatory or based on prejudice, then it might be problematic.\n\nThe author's justification is societal and political tensions. However, judging someone based on their nationality in a dating context can be seen as prejudicial. It's similar to how people might reject others based on race, religion, or other factors, which is generally considered discriminatory unless there are personal incompatibilities.\n\nHowever, the author is 17, and at that age, peer pressure and family expectations can heavily influence decisions. He might be prioritizing his cultural identity and the potential backlash he might face. That said, the decision to not pursue a relationship based on nationality alone could be seen as a form of prejudice, even if it's influenced by external pressures.\n\nOn the other hand, he did consider Maya as a potential partner, enjoyed her company, and wasn't immediately dismissive. He gave her a chance, which shows he didn't act impulsively. But the final decision was based on societal acceptance and marriage possibilities, which are external factors rather than personal incompatibility.\n\nIn many discussions, if someone rejects another because of their background without personal issues, it's often criticized as discriminatory. However, in contexts of political conflict and strong societal disapproval, people might feel they have no choice. The line here is thin. The author isn't forcing the relationship; he's choosing not to pursue it due to external pressures, not because of Maya's character.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the focus is on treating Maya as an individual and not judging her based on nationality, then yes, he might be. But if the context includes real-world pressures that make a relationship unfeasible, it's more nuanced. However, in dating, the standard is usually to choose based on personal compatibility rather than external factors. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by letting societal and political factors override his personal connection.\n"
