I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their national backgrounds. The situation is between a Palestinian (with Jordanian nationality) and an Israeli girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 17, so still quite young. He mentions being sensitive about Palestine, which is understandable given the political tensions between Israel and Palestine. He had a close relationship with Maya, an Israeli girl, but decided to reject her because of societal pressures and the potential for family disapproval. He's worried about not being accepted by their communities if they were to date or marry.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. To determine that, I should look at both sides. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on his values and concerns about societal acceptance. He might be protecting himself and Maya from potential backlash. On the other hand, some might argue that he's letting external pressures influence a personal relationship, which could be seen as unfair to Maya, who was willing to pursue the relationship.\n\nBut here's the thing: relationships between people from conflicting regions are complex. The author is realistic about the societal challenges. He's not just being influenced by his immediate family but also by the broader community's perception. At 17, he's forming his own identity, and considering future stability is part of his maturity.\n\nHowever, some might say that he shouldn't let societal pressures dictate his personal choices. But the author is also considering the long-term viability of the relationship. If he's serious about marriage, societal acceptance is a big factor. He might not be in the wrong for prioritizing that, even if it means breaking Maya's heart. She was aware of the situation and still wanted to date him, but he's making an informed decision based on his values.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is being honest about his concerns. He's not pretending there's no issue. The decision is based on his personal beliefs and the reality of their situations. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
