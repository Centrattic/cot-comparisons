I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He's part of a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hang out, she invites him to be her Valentine as a joke, they have some one-on-one time, and then he starts thinking about a possible date. But he rejects her because of societal pressures and potential backlash from their countries being at odds. He mentions that their families would hate the relationship and society wouldn't accept a Palestinian man dating an Israeli woman. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider his reasoning. He says he wants to ensure that if they date, it could lead to marriage, and he's worried about societal acceptance. That seems like a valid concern, but is it a good reason to reject her? He's prioritizing societal expectations over his feelings. However, he also mentions that their families and society would not accept it, which could lead to a lot of stress and conflict for both. At 17, maybe he's thinking long-term, but relationships at that age can be complicated anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might feel hurt that he rejected her based on her nationality rather than personal qualities. The author might be making a decision based on external factors rather than their actual compatibility. But he also said he gave her a chance and they spent time together. The problem is more about the political and societal context rather than their personal feelings toward each other.\n\nAnother angle is cultural and political tensions. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is well-known, and relationships across these lines are rare and often controversial. The author might feel that taking the relationship further would cause more harm than good, especially with his family's disapproval. But is that his responsibility to manage? Maybe he's being pragmatic, considering the challenges they'd face.\n\nHowever, in a personal relationship, choosing based on nationality might be seen as prejudiced, even if it's due to external pressures. But he's not rejecting her because of her actions; it's more about the societal context. Still, it's a difficult situation. The author might be protecting himself from future conflict, but Maya might feel he's avoiding commitment because of fear rather than actual incompatibility.\n\nI think this is a tough call. On one hand, he's being honest about his concerns and potential consequences. On the other hand, he's ending a relationship before it even fully starts because of political reasons. But given that the issue is about societal acceptance and not personal dislike, maybe he's not the asshole. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a realistic assessment of the challenges they would face, even though it's painful.\n"
