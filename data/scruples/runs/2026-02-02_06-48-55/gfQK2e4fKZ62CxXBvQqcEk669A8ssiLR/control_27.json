I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's a Palestinian-Jordanian guy in the US who met an Israeli girl named Maya. They started hanging out, and she wanted to take it further, but he rejected her because of the political tensions between their countries. His reasoning is that their societies wouldn't accept a relationship between them, and he doesn't want to date someone if he can't see a future with marriage.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural and societal contexts. In some cultures, marrying someone from a different political background or nationality is really frowned upon. If the author is serious about wanting a future with someone, and he believes that his family and society wouldn't accept an Israeli partner, that's a big consideration. But Maya is Israeli, and she's from the other side of the conflict. So, there's historical and political tensions there.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to reject someone solely based on their nationality? Maya is an individual, not a political entity. The author mentions that she was nice, funny, and they had a good time. If he's making a decision based on her nationality rather than her character, that could be problematic. However, if he's thinking long-term and knows that societal pressures would make a relationship impossible, maybe he's being realistic.\n\nAnother angle: The author says he's sensitive about Palestine. That's his personal stance, which is valid. But by rejecting Maya because of her nationality, is he acting on his principles or on societal expectations? If he's doing it because he genuinely believes he can't support a relationship under those circumstances, maybe he's honest about his limitations. But if he's just afraid of others' opinions and not considering Maya's feelings, then he might be the asshole.\n\nAlso, the fact that Maya's parents and his parents would hate the relationship adds another layer. If both sides are against it, maybe it's a lost cause. However, relationships can sometimes overcome societal pressures. The author might be giving up without even trying, which could be seen as cowardice or being inconsiderate to Maya's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is clear about his values and communicates that he can't pursue a relationship because of these factors, he's being honest. It's not like he led her on. Maya initiated the Valentine's thing as a joke, and he was upfront when he needed to think. He rejected her after considering the future implications, which might be responsible.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. He's making a personal choice based on his beliefs and societal context. But rejecting someone for their nationality can be seen as discriminatory. However, if the situation is genuinely unfeasible due to external factors, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether he's being honest and respectful in his rejection. Since he explains his reasons clearly and didn't lead her on, it might not be his fault. But if he's generalizing based on nationality without considering the individual, that's where he could be wrong.\n"
