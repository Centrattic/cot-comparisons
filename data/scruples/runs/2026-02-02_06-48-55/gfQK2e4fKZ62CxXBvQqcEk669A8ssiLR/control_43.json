I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian guy who moved to the USA. He met a group of friends at school, including a girl from Israel named Maya. They became friends, hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which they treated as a joke. They had some one-on-one time, and she wanted to take it further, but he said he needed time to think. Eventually, he rejected her because of the political tensions between Palestine and Israel, citing that their families and society would not accept a relationship between them. The question is whether he's in the wrong for rejecting her based on their nationalities.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of their rejection. The author mentions that he's sensitive about Palestine and that he's concerned about societal reactions. He also mentions that both families would hate the relationship. So, his decision is based on external factors rather than personal feelings towards Maya. But is it fair for him to reject her because of something beyond their control, like political conflict?\n\nOn one hand, societal pressures and family expectations can be significant, especially in a conflict zone. If the author truly believes that the relationship would face insurmountable opposition from both sides, maybe he's being realistic. But on the other hand, choosing a partner based on nationality might be seen as discriminatory, especially if the individuals themselves are willing to try. The author states that Maya was nice, funny, and he enjoyed her company, which suggests that he didn't reject her for personal reasons but due to external factors.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. The author is 17, so he's still young and might not have fully considered long-term implications. However, his reasoning is about marriage and societal acceptance, which are valid concerns for someone considering a serious relationship. However, rejecting someone based on their nationality could be seen as prejudiced, regardless of the external pressures.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing external validation over personal feelings. If he genuinely believes that the relationship can't work due to societal issues, then from his perspective, he's making a logical decision. But if he's avoiding a relationship because of prejudice or fear of others' opinions, that could be problematic. The line between being realistic and being discriminatory is thin here.\n\nI should also consider cultural and political context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is deeply entrenched, and family and societal reactions can be intense. In such a scenario, the author might feel that any relationship would face hostility, making it impractical. However, personal relationships can sometimes transcend political divides, and the author's decision could be seen as giving in to external pressures rather than making an independent choice.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the reasoning. If he's making a rational decision based on real-world challenges that neither he nor Maya can control, then maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's letting prejudice or fear of judgment dictate his choice, then he might be. Since the author acknowledges that he likes Maya and that the issue is societal, it seems more like a pragmatic decision rather than a prejudiced one. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
