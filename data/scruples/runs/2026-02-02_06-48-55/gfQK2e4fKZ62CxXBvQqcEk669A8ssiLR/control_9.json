I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who got to know a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. He started hanging out with them, and Maya was interested in being his Valentine, leading to some fake dates and eventual 1-on-1 time. He rejected her because of the political tensions between their countries, citing societal rejection and his own sensitivity towards Palestine.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The core issue here is the rejection based on nationality. The question is whether that decision is justified or not. \n\nMaya initiated the Valentine's idea as a joke and wanted to connect, and the author found her attractive and enjoyable. However, he prioritized societal and political factors over his personal feelings. Some might argue that in a personal relationship, especially with someone you like, you should be open to exploring the possibility regardless of background. Others might see his stance as valid due to the real-world complexities and potential family/peer disapproval.\n\nHe mentions that his parents and Maya's parents would hate the relationship because of their nationalities. That's a significant pressure point. But as a 17-year-old, maybe he's not in a position where marriage is necessary yet. The question is whether it's fair to reject Maya based on something beyond her control, like her country of origin. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his concerns, which is important in relationships. He's not leading her on by pretending to be interested when he isn't. However, some might say that he should have considered Maya's feelings more, as she was trying to be friendly and open. \n\nThe key factors here are the age of the individuals (17 is a time for forming relationships and exploring feelings), the fact that the relationship was in its early stages, and the societal pressures involved. The author isn't being disrespectful, but he is letting external factors dictate his personal decisions. \n\nIn many cases, people are not in the wrong for having personal boundaries, especially when it comes to family and societal expectations. However, if the rejection is based on prejudice or bias, then it's a different matter. The author's reasoning is tied to the political conflict, which is a sensitive and complex issue. \n\nBut relationships are about individual people, not just their nationalities. By rejecting Maya upfront, he might be closing the door to a potential relationship based on assumptions rather than actual incompatibility. However, he also has the right to his own values and what he's comfortable with. \n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's been honest and hasn't led her on, maybe not. But if he's making a judgment solely based on nationality without giving the relationship a real chance, some might say yes. The question is whether his actions are justified. \n\nSince he's not in the US, but now in the US, maybe the societal pressures are less here. But he's still influenced by the conflict. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal values. The community's response to AITA posts often values personal responsibility and honesty. \n\nHe did have the conversation upfront, so it's not a case of ghosting or being dishonest. But the choice to reject based on nationality is where the debate is. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because it's a personal relationship and he's letting political issues interfere, or B (not in the wrong) because he's being truthful about his values and societal pressures.\n\nI think the answer is A. Relationships should be based on individual compatibility, not nationality. However, I need to be careful because the situation is complex. But in the AITA context, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for rejecting her because of their countries. The community usually frowns on rejecting based on race, religion, or nationality. So, even if it's a sensitive issue, the author is in the wrong for not giving a chance based on the person's own merits. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
