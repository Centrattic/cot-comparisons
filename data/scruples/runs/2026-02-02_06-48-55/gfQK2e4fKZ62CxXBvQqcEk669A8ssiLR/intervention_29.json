I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by rejecting the girl because she's from Israel, considering they're from conflicting nations.\n\nFirst, the author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met a group, including an Israeli girl named Maya, and they became friends. They hung out, she asked him to be her Valentine, they had some one-on-one time, and he felt it could lead to a date. But he rejected her due to societal pressures and the conflict between their countries.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal choice versus societal expectations. The author is worried about his community's reaction and the political situation. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? \n\nOn one hand, relationships, especially romantic ones, are complex. If the author is certain that societal pressures would prevent a future with Maya, then making that decision now might be necessary for both their sakes. He might feel that he's protecting her from potential backlash or not setting himself up for a relationship that others won't accept.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might feel hurt if the rejection is based on her nationality rather than personal incompatibility. The author could be missing out on a genuine connection by letting political tensions interfere. Also, the fact that they were getting along well and she made efforts to connect suggests that there was mutual interest.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is about future potential and societal acceptance. If he's unwilling to consider challenging societal norms for love, then he's making a choice based on that. However, using nationality as a deal-breaker could be seen as prejudicial, especially if there's no personal issue with Maya herself. The conflict between their countries is a political issue, not a personal one between the individuals.\n\nThe question is whether it's acceptable to base a rejection purely on national origins in such a context. Some might argue that it's a personal choice, and he's not obligated to pursue a relationship if he's not comfortable with the societal implications. Others might argue that it's discriminatory to reject someone based on factors beyond their control, like where they were born.\n\nIn this case, the author admits that Maya is a nice person and that they had fun together. So the rejection isn't based on her personality but on the political situation. The problem here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing societal acceptance over personal feelings. It's a tough call because it's about personal values. If he's not ready to challenge those norms and the potential backlash is a real concern, then his decision might be understandable. However, if the rejection is solely due to nationality without considering the possibility of overcoming societal issues, it could be seen as the wrong choice.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the rejection is justified by the author's circumstances. If he's genuinely afraid of societal repercussions and doesn't see a future where he can be with her without conflict, then it's a valid decision. But if he's making a snap judgment without considering that individuals can overcome such barriers, then it might be unwise. However, given the context provided, it's within his rights to make that choice, so maybe he's not the asshole. But some might argue that it's still the wrong decision because it's based on prejudice against her nationality.\n"
