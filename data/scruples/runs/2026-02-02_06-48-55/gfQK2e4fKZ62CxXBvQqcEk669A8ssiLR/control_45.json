I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the girl from Israel because of their nationalities. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now living in the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They started hanging out, and there was some mutual interest. He went on a few \"fake\" dates with her, but eventually decided to reject her because of the political situation between their countries. He mentions societal pressures, his and her parents' disapproval, and the potential for people to judge him for \"selling\" his country. He's worried that their relationship wouldn't be accepted, so he ends it before committing to a real date.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the rejection is based on their nationalities, which are part of a conflict. That could be seen as prejudicial or discriminatory, as he's not evaluating Maya as an individual but categorizing her based on her nationality. However, the author is also considering the real-world implications: societal disapproval, family reactions, and the political tensions. At 17, he's still forming his identity and might be influenced by his community's views. \n\nOn one hand, Maya was a nice person, and he was genuinely interested, but he ended it due to external factors rather than their relationship's merits. This could be seen as unfair to her. On the other hand, he's making a decision based on the reality they both face, which might make the relationship unsustainable. \n\nBut is it right to end a relationship because of something beyond their control, like their nationalities? Some might argue that love and personal choice should override societal pressures. Others might say that he's being realistic about the challenges they'd face. \n\nThe author also mentions that his and her parents would hate each other. That's a family-related issue, but does that justify ending a budding relationship? It's possible he's letting others' opinions influence his decision, which could be seen as cowardly or pragmatic. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author might be in the wrong for not giving the relationship a chance. However, the complexities of the situation can't be ignored. The answer isn't straightforward. \n\nGiven that the question is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario, where people often seek validation, the community might have mixed reactions. Some would side with the author, understanding the political and social pressures. Others would say he's letting prejudice dictate his actions. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision is based on external pressures rather than the relationship's potential. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But the situation is nuanced. However, since the answer is A or B, and the typical AITA answer here is often A when someone is discriminatory, but in this case, it's a conflict-based decision, which is a bit different. \n\nBut the core issue is rejecting someone based on nationality. That's a form of prejudice. Even if the reasons are societal, the action is to reject the person for their background. So, in that sense, he is in the wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
