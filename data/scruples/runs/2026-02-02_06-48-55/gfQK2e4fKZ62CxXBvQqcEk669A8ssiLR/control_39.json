I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian (Jordanian nationality) living in the USA, and they had a budding relationship with Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out a few times, but when it came to a real date, he rejected her due to societal pressure and familial disapproval because of the political tensions between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's decision is rooted in the conflict between Palestine and Israel. In such a politically charged environment, personal relationships can be affected by external pressures. The author mentions that both families would hate the relationship, and society wouldn't accept it. That's a significant factor. \n\nBut is it right to reject someone solely because of their nationality? The author says they are \"sensitive\" to Palestine, which is understandable. However, if they genuinely liked Maya, is it fair to let external factors dictate their choice? On the other hand, the author is also considering long-term commitment (marriage), so they might be realistic about the challenges. \n\nThe key point here is whether the rejection is based on the girl's identity rather than her character. The author liked Maya's personality, found her fun and attractive. If the rejection is purely because of political tensions and not personal incompatibility, some might argue it's a societal bias. Others might see it as pragmatic, given the hostility their relationship would face. \n\nIn cultural contexts where national identity is deeply tied to personal identity and societal acceptance is crucial, such decisions can be complex. The author isn't acting out of hate but from a place of anticipated conflict and pressure. However, some may view this as a form of prejudice, not allowing the relationship to develop despite mutual interest. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong answer here. It's a moral dilemma influenced by political and cultural factors. The author is making a choice based on their environment and values. Whether that makes them an asshole or not depends on perspective. If the question is about being in the wrong in a moral sense, some might say yes, but others would understand the societal pressures involved. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer isn't straightforward. The author's reasoning is influenced by their environment, but it's also a personal choice. The decision to reject based on nationality is ethically questionable, but the context complicates the judgment. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they are making a decision based on external societal pressures rather than personal feelings or the individual merits of the person. However, others might argue for B given the circumstances. But from a purely ethical standpoint, acting on prejudice, even if it's societal, is wrong.\n"
