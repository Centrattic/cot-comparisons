I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel due to political reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality who moved to the US. He met a group of friends, including Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out, had some Valentine's interaction, and he's rejecting her because of societal and parental pressures related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He mentions that their families would hate the relationship and society wouldn't accept it.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the reasons for rejection. He states that his decision is based on the impossibility of the relationship due to societal and familial disapproval, not because of personal dislike of Maya. He acknowledges that she's nice and he enjoyed spending time with her. However, he's concerned about the political and social implications.\n\nIn terms of personal choice, people have the right to choose their partners based on various factors, including family and societal expectations. However, the situation involves political tensions that are beyond their control. The question is whether rejecting someone solely based on their nationality in this context is ethically wrong.\n\nSome might argue that he's in the wrong because he's letting external pressures influence his personal relationships, and Maya might have been willing to face those challenges. Others might say he's not in the wrong because he's being realistic about the potential hardships and the likelihood of family and societal rejection, which could make the relationship unsustainable.\n\nI need to consider cultural and political context. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, relationships between individuals from each side are often met with strong opposition. The author is making a pragmatic decision based on his beliefs and the reality he faces. However, it's also about respect for Maya's feelings. Did he communicate his reasons clearly and compassionately? He did, explaining that it's societal and not personal. That might mitigate some blame.\n\nBut is it wrong to let societal pressures dictate personal choices? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't acting out of malice towards Maya but is choosing not to pursue a relationship due to external factors. However, this could be seen as prioritizing societal approval over personal connection. But given the conflict's nature, his concerns are valid. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a choice based on realistic expectations and family pressures, even if it's difficult. But some might argue A (in the wrong) for letting politics override personal feelings. However, the question is whether he's the asshole. The community might have mixed views, but typically, if someone is being honest about their reasons and the situation is beyond their control, they're not the asshole. So, probably B.\n"
