I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male who moved to the US. He befriended a group, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke, they had some one-on-one time, and then he considered a real date. But he rejected her because of the political situation between their countries, citing societal disapproval and the inability to marry due to their nationalities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is young, 17, and making decisions influenced by societal pressures. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a significant issue, and familial and societal attitudes can be harsh. The user mentions that his parents and Maya's parents would disapprove, which adds pressure. \n\nHe states that his main reason for rejecting her is the possibility of marriage, which he sees as important. However, Maya's parents hate his, and vice versa, making the relationship unsustainable in his view. But is it fair to reject someone based on factors beyond their control, like national origin? That's a key point here.\n\nIn many cultures, people face discrimination or familial pressure regarding relationships with individuals from different ethnicities or nationalities. However, in many Western societies, relationships based on mutual respect and love are encouraged despite such differences. The user is in the US now, which might have a more progressive stance on such matters compared to his home environment. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that society wouldn't accept the relationship. But societal acceptance can change, and individuals do form intergroup relationships. The question is whether the user is justified in rejecting Maya solely because of their nationalities. Maya is an individual, not a symbol of the state. The user seems to conflate the political conflict with personal relationships.\n\nHe might be letting the political conflict dictate his personal choices, which could be seen as unfair to Maya. Also, considering that Maya initiated the interaction and showed interest, rejecting her based on nationality could be viewed as discriminatory. However, the user is under pressure from his community and family, which complicates things.\n\nBut in terms of ethical standpoint, rejecting someone because of their nationality is generally considered discriminatory. The user's decision is based on external pressures rather than the merits of Maya as a person. While the societal context is real, the user is choosing to let that influence his personal life decisions, which might be in the wrong. However, considering his age and the intensity of the conflict, some might argue he's acting out of loyalty to his community. \n\nBut the core issue is whether it's right to reject someone based on their nationality. The answer would likely lean towards \"A\" (the author is in the wrong) because personal relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and individual qualities, not national origin. However, the situation is nuanced due to the political context and the user's upbringing.\n"
