I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now in the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya, who's from Israel. They got along well, and there was some romantic interest. However, the author rejected her because of their nationalities, citing societal pressure and the potential for rejection from both their families and communities. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The author is making a decision based on societal expectations rather than his personal feelings. He mentions that others would judge him for dating someone from Israel, and his parents and her parents would hate each other. He's worried about marriage and societal acceptance. \n\nBut is it wrong to consider societal pressures? Relationships, especially at 17, can be influenced by a lot of factors. However, the author is choosing not to pursue a relationship because of external factors rather than any incompatibility between him and Maya. The problem is whether this is a valid reason to reject someone. \n\nOn one hand, societal norms are real and can have a significant impact on a relationship's viability. If both families are against it, that could create a lot of stress. But on the other hand, the author is making a choice based on the potential for others' reactions rather than the actual relationship's potential. Maya is described as fun, outgoing, and someone he enjoyed spending time with. \n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. The author is aware of the political tensions and the possible backlash but is choosing not to proceed, which is his right. However, if the issue is purely about the relationship between him and Maya, not about any harm or wrongdoing on her part, then it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nIs it discriminatory? Choosing not to date someone because of their nationality could be seen as prejudicial, especially if there's no personal animosity towards Maya herself. The author mentions that he gave her a chance because she was the first Israeli he met, and he found her likable. But his rejection is based on external pressures rather than any issues with Maya's character. \n\nHowever, at 17, people might be heavily influenced by their upbringing and the environment they come from. The author is in a new country, and his perspectives might still be forming. He might not be ready to face the societal backlash, which is a valid consideration for him personally. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize societal acceptance over his feelings. If the relationship could work despite the external pressures, then the author might be closing off a possibility because of external factors. But if he genuinely believes that the societal issues are insurmountable and would harm the relationship, then it's a legitimate decision. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is preemptively deciding the relationship's success based on nationality rather than giving it a real chance. Maya might be willing to face those challenges, but he's choosing not to try. That could be seen as avoiding potential conflict by not engaging in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't hurting Maya directly but is making a choice that might affect her. However, relationships are about mutual consent and comfort. If the author isn't comfortable with the potential fallout, it's understandable. But is it wrong? It depends on whether the rejection is based on the relationship's viability or on prejudice. Since the author is considering societal factors, which are real, but also acknowledges the girl's positive qualities, it's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the decision is based on personal readiness to face societal issues or if it's a blanket rejection due to nationality. The author's reasoning is that society wouldn't accept the relationship, which he's considering a valid reason. However, in terms of fairness to Maya, if there's a chance the relationship could work, ending it preemptively might not be in her best interest. \n\nBut ultimately, the decision is his to make. He's not obligated to pursue a relationship if he doesn't think it's feasible. The question is if that makes him the asshole. If the choice is respectful and communicated clearly, maybe not. However, if it's a knee-jerk reaction to societal pressure without considering the relationship's potential, then maybe yes. \n\nGiven the information, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's rejecting someone based on their nationality and external pressures rather than their compatibility. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering the societal context, it might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice based on his environment.\n"
