I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now in the US. He met a group of people, including Maya from Israel. They hung out, had fun, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They spent time together, and he eventually rejected her because of their nationalities, citing societal pressures and possible reactions from their families and communities.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are his decision to reject Maya based on her nationality and the societal context. He mentions that his parents and her parents would hate each other, and others might view it negatively. He also states he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage, so he's looking for long-term compatibility.\n\nNow, considering cultural and political factors. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is deeply rooted and affects personal relationships. In many cases, families and communities may have strong opinions against such relationships, which can create a lot of pressure. The user is being honest about his feelings and the potential challenges they'd face. He's not pretending to be interested when he's not; he's making a conscious choice based on his values and concerns for the future.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's letting societal pressure dictate his personal choices, especially given their young age. At 17, people are still figuring out their identities and what they want in relationships. Maya might feel that he's closing the door without giving the relationship a real chance, even if he's unsure. On the other hand, he's being upfront about his limitations, which is a mature approach. It's also important to note that the user made it clear he wasn't interested in a long-term future with her, which is a valid reason to decline a relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that he was honest with Maya. He didn't lead her on or give false hope. He explained his reasons, which shows respect for her feelings. Even though the reasons are based on external pressures, he's being truthful, which is important in any relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user is rejecting Maya due to societal and familial pressures, which are real and significant in this context. He's being honest and upfront, which is commendable. While some might criticize him for not being more open-minded, given the circumstances and his own concerns about acceptance and future, his decision isn't necessarily wrong. He's not in the wrong because he's acting based on his own values and the reality of the situation, even if that reality is influenced by external factors.\n"
