I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting the girl because she's from Israel. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian nationality. He moved to the USA last year. He met a group of friends, including Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out, and she asked him to be her Valentine, which he accepted. They had some fun together, but when she wanted a real date, he rejected her because of societal issues related to their nationalities. His parents and Maya's parents would disapprove, and others would criticize him for \"selling\" his country. He's worried about societal acceptance and future marriage.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider different angles.\n\nFirst, personal choices vs. societal pressure. The author is choosing not to pursue a relationship due to external factors like family and societal disapproval. But does that make him the asshole? Well, he's being honest about his feelings and the practical challenges. However, rejecting someone solely based on nationality might be seen as discriminatory, especially if there's no personal issue with her as a person. The user says he liked hanging out with her, found her nice and attractive, but rejected her because of society's reaction.\n\nIs it fair to reject someone based on factors beyond their control, like nationality? Some might argue that personal choice is valid, especially considering the political tensions between Israel and Palestine. Others might say that choosing not to date someone because of their nationality is bigoted, similar to racism or xenophobia. However, in this context, it's more about a political conflict rather than race, but the principle might be similar.\n\nBut the author also mentions that he's sensitive to Palestine and the conflict, which adds complexity. He's not rejecting her for trivial reasons but because of deep-seated societal issues. He might genuinely fear the consequences of a relationship, both socially and from his family. However, it's also possible that he's letting external pressures dictate his personal decisions, which could be seen as cowardice or a failure to stand by his own feelings.\n\nAnother angle: Maya is from Israel, and the author is Palestinian. Their relationship would be a political statement, and they might face real challenges. If the author is not willing to face those challenges, he has a right to choose not to pursue it. But if he's rejecting her not just for practical reasons but also because of his stance on the conflict, that could be problematic. However, the user says he didn't have issues with Maya personally; he found her nice and fun.\n\nThe key here is whether the rejection is based on her nationality itself or the realistic consequences of a relationship. If it's the latter, it's more about practicality. If it's the former, then it's more about prejudice. The user states he's rejecting her because society won't accept it and the parents hate each other. So it's more about the external factors. However, the societal acceptance is a direct result of the political conflict, not her personal actions. So the author is choosing not to date her because of the political situation, which is a valid concern but might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, personal freedom to choose partners is important, but so is respecting others' identities. If the author is making a choice based on his values and the realities of their situation, he's not necessarily wrong. But if he's using the societal pressures as an excuse to avoid a relationship he's not genuinely interested in, then it's a different story. However, given the context, he seems to have developed a connection but is prioritizing societal approval over personal feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his values and the challenges he anticipates. However, it's a close call. Some might argue that he's letting external pressures override his personal feelings, but given the political complexity, it's understandable. Therefore, likely answer B.\n"
