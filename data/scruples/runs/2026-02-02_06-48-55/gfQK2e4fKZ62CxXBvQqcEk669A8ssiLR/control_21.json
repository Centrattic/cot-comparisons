I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who's been hanging out with a group, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They had some fun interactions, even fake dates, but he decided not to pursue a real relationship because of the political tensions between their nations. He's worried about societal backlash and his families' disapproval, as well as the possibility of marriage. The question is whether he's the asshole for rejecting her based on nationality.\n\nHmm. The key factors here are consent, personal beliefs, and societal pressures. Maya initiated the fake dates, and the author was considering a real relationship but decided against it due to external factors. The author isn't making Maya feel bad directly; he's choosing not to engage in a relationship due to his own convictions and expectations of others' reactions. However, the rejection is based on national identity, which is a political and cultural issue. \n\nIn some contexts, relationships across such divides are discouraged, but others argue it's about individual choice. The author is being honest about his stance, but is that a valid reason? The question is whether his decision is unfair. Since he's upfront and not pressuring her, maybe he's not the asshole. But some might see it as closing off a potential relationship based on something beyond their control. However, cultural and familial acceptance are real concerns. \n\nAlso, considering Maya's perspective: she might be hurt, but the author isn't being insincere. He's making a choice based on his values and environment. So, the answer might be B (he's not the asshole) because he's acting on his beliefs and not being deceitful. However, others might argue that love transcends such issues. But given the societal pressures and his own stance, it's a personal decision. So I think the answer is B.\n"
