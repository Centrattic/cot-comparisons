I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for rejecting the girl because she's from Israel. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 17 years old, from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now in the USA. He met a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out together, and Maya made a move towards a romantic connection. The author felt a connection but decided to reject her because of the political tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, fearing societal backlash and not wanting to face disapproval from both their families and communities. He mentions that if they were to date, their families would hate each other, and society wouldn't accept it. He's worried about not being able to marry her and the societal pressures involved.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons are based on societal and political factors beyond their control. He's concerned about family and societal acceptance, which is a real issue in many cultures. However, making a decision based on national identity rather than personal feelings could be seen as prejudiced. But considering the age (17), he might not be ready for a long-term commitment, and the societal pressures are significant.\n\nOn the other hand, he gave Maya a chance after initial hesitation. He didn't reject her immediately but considered their potential future together. His decision might be influenced by fear of external judgment rather than personal compatibility. However, he's also considering practical aspects like marriage and societal acceptance, which are important in some cultures.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, especially when considering marriage, both parties need to be on the same page about future challenges. If the author isn't willing to face those challenges, it's reasonable to question the viability of the relationship. However, is it fair to reject someone solely based on their nationality when the issue is political and societal? That's where it gets tricky.\n\nThe author might be avoiding responsibility for their own feelings, using the societal conflict as an excuse. But at the same time, the conflict is real and affects their lives. It's not just about personal feelings but also about the realities of their situation.\n\nIn some cultures, marrying someone from an opposing group is extremely difficult, so maybe the author is being realistic. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? It could be seen as closing the door without considering the possibility of changing societal views or personal resilience.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the rejection is based on prejudice against her nationality, then yes. But if it's due to practical considerations (family opposition, societal rejection), maybe not. But the key point is that he's making a judgment based on her nationality, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, given the context of a political conflict, it's a complex situation.\n\nI think the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's considering real-world implications, but some might argue that he should be open-minded. Since the question is about whether he's the asshole (AITA), the community usually considers intent and fairness. If he's honest about his reasons and not acting out of hatred, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might say that using nationality as a deal-breaker is problematic regardless of the context.\n"
