I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is a Palestinian male in the US, and the girl is from Israel. They hung out a bit, and he turned down a real date because he doesn't think their relationship would be accepted by their societies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his family and society might not accept a relationship between them. He's worried about societal backlash and the political tensions between Palestine and Israel. He's also young, 17, so maybe he's not ready for a committed relationship, but he's giving reasons related to external factors.\n\nIs it wrong to consider societal and familial acceptance? Well, people often factor in their family's opinions and their own values when making relationship decisions. If he genuinely believes that their societies would not accept the relationship, leading to potential conflict or distress, that's a valid concern. However, some might argue that personal choice and following one's heart are more important than external pressures, especially if the relationship is healthy and mutual.\n\nBut the author also says he's looking for a possible marriage, which implies a long-term commitment. He might be realistic about the challenges of such a relationship, considering the ongoing conflict and the potential for family disapproval. Yet, rejecting someone solely based on nationality could be seen as prejudiced, especially if he's developed a genuine connection with her.\n\nOn the other hand, it's his choice to prioritize his values and family expectations. He's not forcing her into anything; he's making a decision based on his own circumstances. However, some might say that by giving her a chance, he's already shown openness, so turning her down because of societal norms could be seen as inconsistent.\n\nI should also consider the girl's perspective. If she was genuinely interested and he's dismissing her due to external factors, it might hurt her feelings. But the author did mention that the dates were \"fake\" and that she initiated the V-day thing as a joke. Maybe he's not entirely sure about his feelings yet, so using the societal issue as a reason could be a way to avoid a real commitment he's not ready for.\n\nIn summary, there's a balance between personal choice and external pressures. The author's decision isn't necessarily malicious, but it could be seen as avoiding the complexities of a cross-border relationship. However, he's being honest about his limitations and societal constraints. So, whether he's the asshole depends on how much weight one gives to societal pressures versus personal freedom.\n"
