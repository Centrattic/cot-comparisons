I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting an Israeli girl due to their nationalities. The situation is complex because it involves political tensions between Palestine and Israel. \n\nFirst, the author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through mutual friends. They hung out, and she asked to be his Valentine. He went on a few dates but eventually rejected her because of societal pressures and the incompatibility of their nationalities.\n\nThe key points here are his reasons for rejection. He mentions that his and her families would hate the relationship, and societal acceptance is an issue. He also states that he wants a relationship that could lead to marriage, which he doesn't think possible here.\n\nI need to consider whether rejecting someone solely based on their nationality is fair or not. If the author is making a decision based on external pressures rather than personal feelings, that might be problematic. However, if he genuinely believes that societal and familial issues would cause insurmountable problems, maybe he's being realistic. \n\nBut wait, Maya was open to a relationship, and they had a good time. The author's decision seems to be influenced by external factors more than his own feelings towards her. That could be seen as unfair. Also, in a personal relationship, should the person's own feelings and compatibility matter more than external pressures? The author's focus on marriage and societal acceptance might be prioritizing others' opinions over his own and Maya's potential happiness.\n\nAnother angle: the author is 17, which is young, and he might not have fully processed his feelings yet. The situation is also complicated by political tensions, which are real and significant. However, judging someone based on their nationality without considering the individual is usually considered prejudice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the rejection is based on her nationality rather than personal incompatibility, then yes, it could be seen as him being in the wrong. But if he's considering real-world challenges that would affect their relationship's success, maybe not. The line here is tricky. The fact that he went on dates first suggests he had feelings, and then backed out due to external factors. That could be hurtful, even if justified by him. \n\nIn conclusion, the decision is about whether personal feelings or external factors should take precedence. Since the author is making a choice based on societal pressures rather than personal connection, he might be on the wrong side. So, the answer would be A.\n"
