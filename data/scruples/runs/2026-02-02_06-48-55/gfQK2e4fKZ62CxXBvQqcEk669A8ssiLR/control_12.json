I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting someone because of their nationality. The author is Palestinian (Jordanian nationality) in the US, and he rejected an Israeli girl after some initial interactions. He explains that societal and political tensions between Palestinians and Israelis make it hard for their relationship to be accepted, especially if they were to consider marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In some communities, relationships across national or ethnic lines are frowned upon. The author mentions that his parents and the girl's parents would oppose it, and others might view it as \"selling out.\" But is that a valid reason to reject someone? The question here is whether personal beliefs and societal pressures justify ending a potential relationship.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal agency. The author states he wants to ensure the possibility of marriage, so he's being upfront about his values. However, the girl might have different views or be willing to work through those challenges. By rejecting her early on, did he close off a possibility where they could have navigated those issues together?\n\nAnother angle is the idea of prejudice. The author is making a decision based on nationality without giving the relationship a real chance. Even if societal pressures are real, acting on them could be seen as perpetuating division. But he's also honest about his stance, which might be respectful in a way.\n\nI should also consider the girl's perspective. If she approached him with openness and interest, only to be turned down based on political tensions, she might feel hurt. However, the author isn't being dishonest; he's stating his boundaries upfront.\n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing his cultural and political stance? Some might argue that personal feelings and individual relationships can transcend political issues. Others might say he's being realistic about the challenges involved. The key point is whether he's responsible for societal attitudes or if he's just acting on his own values.\n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether societal pressures are a valid reason to reject someone. If the author is making a conscious choice based on his values, even if those values are influenced by external factors, it's his prerogative. However, if he's internalizing prejudice without considering the individual merits, then he might be in the wrong. The situation is complex, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries based on his beliefs.\n"
