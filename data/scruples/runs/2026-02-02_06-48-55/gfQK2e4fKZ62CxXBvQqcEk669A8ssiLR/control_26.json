I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US. He met Maya, an Israeli girl, through a group of friends. They started hanging out, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They had some one-on-one time, and he felt like they clicked, but when she wanted to take it to a real date, he rejected her because of societal pressures and the conflict between their countries.\n\nThe key points here are the age, the context of the rejection, and the reasons behind it. At 17, he's still young and forming his views. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a real, complex issue that affects people's lives and relationships. The author mentions that both families would disapprove, and society might not accept their relationship. That's a valid concern, especially in a politically charged environment.\n\nHe also says he wants to consider marriage, which implies he's thinking about long-term commitments. If societal pressures and family disapproval are significant barriers, he might be realistically assessing the feasibility of a relationship. However, the question is whether his rejection is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, Maya might feel hurt that he didn't consider their personal connection enough to overcome external pressures. The author could be avoiding a potential relationship due to external factors rather than personal compatibility. But given the situation, he's making a choice based on his values and the reality he's aware of.\n\nIs it his fault? Well, he's being honest about his concerns. He didn't lead her on; he gave her a chance and then made a decision based on his circumstances. However, some might argue that he should prioritize his feelings and the relationship over external pressures, but others might see his decision as pragmatic. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's being truthful and considering real-world implications, even if it's a tough choice.\n"
