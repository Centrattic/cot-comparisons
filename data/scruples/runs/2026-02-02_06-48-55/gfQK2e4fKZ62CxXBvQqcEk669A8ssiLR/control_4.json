I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. They formed a group with the Israeli girl, Maya, and they started hanging out. Maya made moves towards a date, but the author rejected her because of societal and political issues between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal values. The author mentions wanting marriage possibilities and societal acceptance. In many cultures, family and societal opinions matter a lot, especially in relationships. The author's hesitation is partly due to external pressures. However, Maya is from Israel, and their parents' disapproval is a factor. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is 17. At that age, people might be more influenced by their environment and peers. The rejection is based on nationality, which could be seen as prejudicial. The author might be making a decision based on fear of societal judgment rather than personal feelings. The fact that the author found Maya attractive and enjoyable to be with complicates things. \n\nAlso, the situation involves real political tensions. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is a significant issue, and personal relationships can be affected by this. The author might feel that their choices are constrained by this conflict. However, choosing someone based on nationality without giving the relationship a fair chance could be seen as unfair.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the decision was based purely on nationality without considering the person's character, then maybe yes. But if it's about realistic societal challenges and personal values, then it's more nuanced. The author's reasoning about marriage and societal acceptance is valid in their context, but acting on it might prevent a potential relationship. It's a tough spot. The answer could swing either way depending on how much weight is given to personal choice versus societal pressures.\n"
