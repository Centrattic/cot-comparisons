I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the USA who rejected a girl from Israel because of their nationalities and the societal tensions between their countries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that both families would hate the relationship because of the conflict between Palestine and Israel. He also notes that if he dates her, people around him might look negatively, even calling him a traitor. The key here is whether rejecting someone based on nationality is justified, especially in a context of political conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author is making a choice based on his personal values and the social environment he's in. He's aware of the potential consequences, including family disapproval and societal backlash. At 17, he's still forming his views and making decisions that align with his identity and community. It's possible that he's trying to stay true to his cultural and political beliefs, which are significant in his life.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl in question, Maya, is from Israel, but the author admits she was kind, funny, and they had a good time together. He even went on fake dates with her. Rejecting her solely because of her nationality might be seen as prejudicial, especially if there's no personal issue with her as an individual. This could be viewed as letting political tensions override personal compatibility and genuine connection.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering the long-term implications. He mentions that he looks for a possibility of marriage, which would require societal acceptance. If he's realistic about the challenges they would face, like family disapproval and potential social ostracism, then his decision is based on practicality rather than just emotion. It's a matter of personal choice and the reality of the conflict they're both part of.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. At 17, people are still exploring their identities and relationships. His decision might be seen as a reflection of his current beliefs and the environment he's growing up in. It's not necessarily wrong to prioritize personal and familial acceptance, especially in a context where such relationships are heavily stigmatized.\n\nBut some might argue that love and personal relationships shouldn't be dictated by political conflicts. The author is choosing to avoid a relationship based on national identity, which could be seen as a form of prejudice. However, he's not making a blanket judgment against all Israelis but is considering the specific societal implications in his case.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If we consider personal autonomy and the reality of their socio-political context, his decision might be justified. If we emphasize individual choice over political tensions, then it's a matter of personal values. But given the circumstances described, it's a complex issue where the author is making a choice based on his environment and values. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's acting according to his beliefs and the challenges he anticipates.\n"
