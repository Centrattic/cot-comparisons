I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality who moved to the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya, an Israeli girl. They hung out a lot, and she asked him to be her Valentine as a joke. They spent time together, and he considered dating her, but ultimately rejected her because of the political tensions between their nations. His parents and hers would disapprove, and societal pressure makes a relationship impossible. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if he's in the wrong. The key points are his reasons for rejecting her. He's concerned about societal acceptance and family disapproval. But he also mentions that Maya was from Israel, which is a sensitive issue for him due to his Palestinian background. \n\nNow, is it wrong to base a relationship on political conflict and societal expectations? In some cases, people do end relationships due to family or cultural pressures, but that can be seen as avoiding personal responsibility. However, the situation here is more complex because of the real and intense conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The societal pressures are significant, and in some cases, relationships between people from these groups can lead to serious consequences, including ostracization or even violence.\n\nHowever, Maya initiated the interaction, and he gave her a chance. He wasn't outright cruel; he considered it and then decided against it because of the external factors. The question is whether it's fair to reject someone based on their nationality due to external conflicts. On one hand, it's about personal choice and the reality of their situation. On the other, it could be seen as discriminatory or using the conflict as an excuse to avoid a difficult relationship.\n\nThe user is 17, so he might not be in a position to challenge family or societal norms yet. The answer might depend on cultural context and the severity of the consequences. If the relationship would lead to significant harm, then his decision might be more understandable. However, if it's just about social disapproval without actual threats, then it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut since the conflict is real and the families would hate each other, it's a legitimate concern. He's choosing not to pursue a relationship that might not be viable long-term. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should be open to love regardless of political issues. But given the severity of the conflict, it's a nuanced situation. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on realistic societal challenges. However, others might argue that it's still wrong to reject someone for their nationality. The line is blurry here, but the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict adds a layer where such a decision isn't just about personal preference but real-world consequences.\n"
