I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for rejecting the Israeli girl due to political tensions. The person is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, living in the USA. They met a group, including an Israeli girl named Maya, and they started hanging out. Maya asked to be her Valentine, they had some time together, but the author decided to reject her because of the political situation and societal expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The conflict between Palestine and Israel is a deep-rooted political and cultural issue. The author mentions that their family and Maya's family would not accept the relationship because of their nationalities. He also says that people in his environment would look shocked or criticize him for being with someone from Israel. He's concerned about societal acceptance and the possibility of marriage because of that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze both sides. On one hand, the author is making a decision based on his values and the reality of the situation. He's prioritizing societal and familial approval, which he sees as important for a lasting relationship. On the other hand, Maya might feel hurt and rejected because of factors outside her control\u2014her nationality isn't something she can change. The author is choosing not to pursue a relationship because of external pressures rather than personal incompatibility.\n\nBut then, relationships often involve considering external factors like family and culture. If the author believes that without societal support, a marriage isn't feasible, that's a valid concern. However, is it fair to reject someone based on their nationality when they're an individual with her own personality? The author mentions that Maya was funny, outgoing, and they had a good time together. So he liked her as a person but still chose not to continue because of the political situation.\n\nThe question is whether that's the right call. Some might argue that love shouldn't be limited by nationality, but others might agree that practical considerations are important. The author isn't in a position to force his family or society to accept their relationship. However, the rejection here is based on a fundamental aspect of her identity that she can't control, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. If he's honest about his reasons and isn't using them to avoid a committed relationship, some might say he's not the asshole. Others might say that he's letting external pressures dictate his personal choices, which is a valid but perhaps harsh stance. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points. However, since the rejection is based on her nationality and not her personal qualities, it could be seen as discriminatory, making the author the asshole. Alternatively, if he's being realistic about societal challenges, he's not the asshole.\n"
