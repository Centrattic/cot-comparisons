I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 17-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian male in the US who rejected an Israeli girl because of their nationalities. The girl, Maya, was part of a group he hung out with, and they had some interactions that started as fake dates and maybe could have developed into something more. He rejected her because of societal pressures, family expectations, and the political conflict between Palestine and Israel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's main reason for rejection is societal and familial disapproval. Is it wrong to base a relationship decision on external pressures? Well, relationships are personal, and people do make choices based on their values and circumstances. However, there's also the aspect of Maya's feelings. By rejecting her, is he being fair to her? She might have been genuinely interested, and he might have led her on if he wasn't sure about his feelings. \n\nBut the author mentions that he wanted to ensure the relationship could lead to marriage if things worked out. That's a valid consideration for him personally. However, at 17, he might not be in a position to commit to such a long-term decision, and that could be a factor. \n\nThe conflict between their countries is real and significant, so family and societal reactions are a legitimate concern. But is the author in the wrong for prioritizing that over his feelings? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's not obligated to pursue a relationship against his cultural and familial values. On the other hand, he might be avoiding personal responsibility for his feelings and the potential to work through the challenges.\n\nAnother angle is whether he gave Maya a fair chance. He said he gave her a chance initially but ultimately decided against it. However, the rejection is based on external factors rather than personal incompatibility. So, is it fair for him to reject her before even fully exploring a relationship? \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for acting on his values and concerns. While some might argue that he's making a safe choice and considering the real-world implications, others might see it as cowardice or a failure to stand by his own feelings. However, the situation is complex, and the answer might depend on cultural context and personal beliefs about love and societal expectations.\n"
