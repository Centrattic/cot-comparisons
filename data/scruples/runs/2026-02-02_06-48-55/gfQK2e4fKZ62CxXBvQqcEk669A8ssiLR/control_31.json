I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old from Palestine with Jordanian nationality, now in the USA. He met a group of friends, including Maya from Israel. They hung out together, and Maya asked him to be her Valentine for fun. They had some one-on-one time, and she wanted to take it to an actual date. He said he needed time to think and eventually rejected her because he's concerned about societal reactions. He mentions that their parents and others in their communities would disapprove due to the political conflict between Israel and Palestine. He says he can't get into a relationship because he wants it to potentially lead to marriage, and he's worried about societal acceptance.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is a real and ongoing issue. The author is Palestinian, and Maya is Israeli. The societal pressures they both face are significant. The author is worried about how others would react, which affects his decision. \n\nHowever, Maya initiated contact and was open about being from Israel, and the author gave her a chance initially. He spent time with her and even went on what seems like a few dates. The rejection came after some time, and he was honest about his reasons. \n\nIs it wrong to consider societal and familial pressures when making personal decisions? The author is prioritizing his values and potential future with his family's and society's expectations. On the other hand, Maya might feel hurt or rejected because he didn't want to pursue a relationship due to external factors rather than personal incompatibility. \n\nBut is the author responsible for the societal issues? He's a 17-year-old navigating a complex geopolitical situation. He's not the one causing the conflict. His decision is based on real-world consequences and his personal values. However, some might argue that he should be willing to follow his heart regardless of external pressures. \n\nBut in reality, societal acceptance is a valid concern, especially regarding marriage and family. The author is being honest about his limitations. If he were to proceed, it might lead to a lot of stress and conflict for both parties. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the question is about whether he's an asshole for being honest about his inability to commit due to external factors, maybe not. He's not being malicious; he's being realistic. On the other hand, some might say he's letting external factors dictate his personal life, which could be seen as cowardly. \n\nBut considering the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on real-world challenges and being truthful about his stance.\n"
