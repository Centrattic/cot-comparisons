I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of their nationalities. The author is a Palestinian from Jordan living in the US. He had a group of friends, including an Israeli girl named Maya. They hung out, she asked him to be her Valentine, and they had some one-on-one time. He considered it but rejected her because of societal pressures and the fact that their families and communities might not accept a relationship between a Palestinian and an Israeli. He's worried about marriage and societal judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points are: the rejection is based on national origin, which is a sensitive issue given the political conflict between Palestine and Israel. The user is concerned about societal acceptance and family approval. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting someone based on her nationality.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, rejecting someone solely because of their nationality, especially in a personal relationship, can be problematic. However, the author's reasons are influenced by the real-world tensions and potential consequences from his community and family. He also mentions that marriage is important, which adds another layer. The girl might have felt rejected not just for herself but because of external factors beyond her control.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is being honest about his limitations. He didn't lead her on; he considered the situation and made a decision based on his values and circumstances. However, the rejection is based on her nationality, which is a sensitive and controversial factor here. It's important to recognize that the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is deeply rooted, and personal relationships can be affected by these larger issues.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author isn't being dishonest, he is making a decision based on external pressures rather than the relationship's intrinsic merits. It's understandable given the context, but it's still a rejection based on national identity, which can be seen as discriminatory, even if the reasons are societal. However, since the author is being upfront and hasn't misled Maya, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether we judge the action purely on the basis of rejecting someone for their nationality or consider the context of the political conflict and the author's sincerity in explaining his reasons. If the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, it's a delicate balance between personal choice and societal expectations.\n"
