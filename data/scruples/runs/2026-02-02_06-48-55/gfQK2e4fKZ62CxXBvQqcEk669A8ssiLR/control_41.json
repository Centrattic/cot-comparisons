I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl he was getting close to because she's from Israel, and he's Palestinian with Jordanian nationality. The situation is pretty complex because of the political tensions between Israel and Palestine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author rejected her due to societal and familial pressures, not because of any personal issues with her. He mentions that their families would hate each other and that others would judge him for being with someone from Israel. But is it fair for external factors to dictate his personal choices?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to love who they choose. However, the author is aware of the potential negative consequences, both socially and personally. He also mentions that he was considering the possibility of marriage, so he's thinking ahead. But does that make it okay to reject someone based on political identity?\n\nAnother angle is the girl's perspective. Maya was open and friendly, and the author felt a connection. By rejecting her, he's making a choice based on external factors rather than the actual relationship. It could be seen as not being fully committed to exploring the relationship because of preconceived societal norms.\n\nBut then again, the author is in a position where he's conscious of his identity and the potential backlash. He might be protecting himself from future conflict with his family and community. However, he should also consider whether those reactions are justified or based on stereotypes.\n\nIn some cultures, family and societal expectations are very strong. However, personal relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and love, not political affiliations. The author might be prioritizing external validation over his own desires and the girl's feelings.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? On one hand, he's making a choice based on real-world consequences. On the other hand, love and relationships shouldn't be bound by political borders. The answer isn't clear-cut. But the question is whether the author is wrong. If we consider that he didn't have malicious intent and was honest with Maya, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if we think that personal feelings should override societal pressures, then he is wrong. The key here is whether the rejection is fair given the circumstances. The answer might be more nuanced, but I need to choose between A and B. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). Given the situation, the author's decision is influenced by societal pressures, which might not make him the asshole, but it's a gray area. The community might have different views, but in terms of personal ethics, it's about his own values. So, he might not be in the wrong, but it's debatable. I'll go with B.\n"
