I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl from Israel because of political tensions between their countries. The situation is that they were hanging out, and he ended up rejecting her due to societal pressures and family expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. The author is Palestinian with Jordanian nationality, and the girl is Israeli. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is well-known, so societal disapproval of their relationship would be significant. The author mentions that both families would hate the other and that their society wouldn't accept such a relationship.\n\nHe also mentions that he values the possibility of marriage and societal acceptance. In many cultures, family and societal approval are crucial for marriage. If the author is clear that he's looking for a long-term commitment with marriage in mind, then his rejection based on these factors might be seen as a personal choice rather than being wrong. However, some might argue that he's letting politics affect a personal relationship, which could be seen as closing off a potential meaningful connection because of external pressures.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl, Maya, was open about her feelings, and he did give her a chance. But he's up front about his values and expectations. People might have different opinions here. Some might say he's being honest about his priorities, which is fair. Others might think he's avoiding commitment due to fear of societal backlash rather than personal incompatibility.\n\nThe key points here are his reasons: societal pressure and lack of acceptance. If he's making a decision based on his own values and priorities, even if they're influenced by his environment, it's a personal choice. However, if he's not considering the possibility of working through those issues or if he's not being honest with himself about his feelings, that's a different story.\n\nIn conclusion, since he's being honest about his stance on marriage and societal acceptance, and it's a personal decision based on his values, it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B (No), he's not the asshole.\n"
