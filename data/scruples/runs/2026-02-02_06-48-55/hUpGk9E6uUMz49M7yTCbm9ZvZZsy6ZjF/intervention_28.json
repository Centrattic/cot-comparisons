I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of an animal they accidentally hit. The situation is that the person hit the dog with their car, the dog died instantly, and now the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and memorials.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, the owner might seek compensation. But legally, it's not always clear. If the owner was negligent, like allowing the dog to roam loose, that could affect liability. The author mentioned seeing the dog roaming before, so maybe the owner is responsible for not keeping the dog contained. That could shift some responsibility away from the driver.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is clearly upset and feels guilty. They did contact the owner, provided an emergency blanket, and expressed sympathy. The owner is now asking for expenses for cremation and a memorial. But the author is a student with financial issues and a deductible from the car. Are they morally obligated to pay? It's a gray area. Some might say showing compassion is important, but others might argue that if the owner is responsible for the dog being on the road, they should cover the costs.\n\nFinancial hardship is a factor. The author can't afford it, and the deductible is already taking a toll. They might not have the means to pay for the memorial. Legally, if there's no law requiring this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the owner is seeking compensation for the dog's death, regardless of the reason, the author might be expected to pay, depending on local laws.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were accidental and unavoidable. The dog suddenly appeared, so the driver couldn't have prevented it. That might reduce liability. In some jurisdictions, if you can prove it was unavoidable, you might not be liable for damages beyond the immediate costs, like veterinary bills, but memorial costs might be considered optional and not a standard part of compensation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, it might depend on local laws and the owner's negligence. Morally, the author showed remorse and did their part. Financially, they can't afford it. If the owner is partly at fault for the dog being loose, the author's responsibility is lessened. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing to pay for the memorial.\n"
