I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit. First, I need to understand the situation. The person hit a dog while driving, which is truly an accident. They felt guilty, tried to help, and even offered to wrap the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner later asked for $150 for cremation and a memorial.\n\nNow, the question is about moral and legal responsibility. Legally, in many places, if you hit an animal, you might not be liable for cremation costs unless there's a specific law. But morally, it's a different story. The author argues that the dog was let out before, they're broke, and it was an accident. However, they were the one who caused the death, so there's a sense of empathy and responsibility here.\n\nThe author is conflicted between their financial situation and their guilt. They want to show they're sorry but can't afford it. The owner is asking for expenses that are emotional (memorial items). Some might say it's reasonable to help with cremation, others might think it's too much, especially with the car damage and deductible.\n\nBut considering the author's situation: college student, already dealing with a $1k deductible, and the request is $150. $150 might be a significant amount for them. Also, the dog's owner could have covered the cremation themselves, but they're asking the person responsible. However, since the author didn't intentionally harm the dog, maybe they aren't obligated. \n\nMoral responsibility vs. financial ability. If the author can afford a little, maybe they should contribute a bit, but if they can't, it's understandable. The key points are accident, no intent, and financial hardship. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because it was an accident and they can't afford it, but there's room for empathy. Legally, maybe they don't have to pay, but morally, some might argue to help if possible. But given the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
