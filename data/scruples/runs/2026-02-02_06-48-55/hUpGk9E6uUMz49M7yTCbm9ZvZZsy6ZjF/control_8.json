I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally killed. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author hit a dog while driving, which resulted in the dog's death. The dog had a collar with a number, and the owner was contacted. The owner is now asking for $150 to cover cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car insurance deductible of nearly $1k.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author is legally or morally obligated to pay for the cremation. Legally, in many places, if you cause an animal's death through negligence, you might be responsible for veterinary bills or other costs, but cremation might be a gray area. However, the author states it was an accident and the dog was roaming, which could indicate the owner was partially at fault for not keeping the dog contained. \n\nMorally, the author is conflicted. They feel guilty and want to show remorse, but their financial situation is dire. The owner's request includes memorial items, which might be seen as optional rather than necessary. The author's reasoning includes that the dog was often seen loose, they can't afford it, and it was an accident.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, it's unclear, but morally, it's about responsibility. If the owner's negligence (letting the dog roam) contributed, maybe the author isn't fully at fault. Also, the author is already facing financial loss from the car damage. The request for a memorial might be seen as emotional rather than essential. \n\nHowever, showing empathy and willingness to help, even in small ways, might be expected. The author is torn but might feel justified in refusing due to the circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because it was an accident, the owner had some responsibility, and the financial burden is significant. But I need to check if there's a standard expectation to cover such costs regardless.\n"
