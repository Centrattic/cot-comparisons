I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. The situation is that the author was driving on a country road, a dog ran out, they couldn't stop in time, the dog died instantly. The owner then asked them to cover the cremation and some memorial items totaling $150.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal while driving, especially a pet, there might be some legal obligation, but usually, it's the owner's responsibility. However, if the dog was allowed to roam freely, maybe the owner is at fault? The author mentions they've seen the dog running loose before. But the laws vary by location. For example, in some states, the driver might be liable if the dog was in a public area, but if the dog was off-leash where it's not allowed, maybe not. The author had car damage and a deductible, so maybe insurance would cover any liability, but the post says they're dealing with an insurance claim now. If the insurance is covering the car damage, perhaps the liability part could cover the dog's cremation. But the author is a student with financial issues, so maybe they can't afford it even if they wanted to.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels guilty and wants to show remorse, but they also have valid reasons for not paying. They explain the accident was unavoidable, the dog wasn't in a dangerous place (since it came from a cornfield a few feet from the road), and the owner might be responsible for letting the dog roam. The author is in a tough financial spot, so should they still pay out of goodwill? Or is the owner being unreasonable by asking for extra memorial items?\n\nThe key points are: the dog's death was accidental, the owner may have allowed the dog to be in a place where this could happen, the financial burden on the driver, and the request for specific non-essential items. If the driver was not at fault legally, then they might not be obligated to pay. But ethically, some might argue contributing a small amount could be a kind gesture despite the circumstances. However, the author is a student with no money, and the total is $150, which is a significant sum for them. The owner's request includes things like a memorial stone and vase, which are optional, so maybe the author isn't responsible for those. The main issue is whether the driver is legally responsible for the dog's cremation costs. If the law doesn't require it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if there's a rule that if you hit an animal, you have to cover burial/cremation, then maybe they are. Since the author is asking for opinions, and the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the situation is more nuanced. I think the answer is B (No), because it was an accident, the driver wasn't negligent if the dog was in a place where it shouldn't be, and the owner's responsibility for the dog's presence should matter. Also, the memorial items are optional, so the author isn't required to pay for those. Their financial situation adds to the justification.\n"
