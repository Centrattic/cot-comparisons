I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user asked if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was driving and hit a dog that suddenly ran out. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog died instantly. The owner came, and now they want the author to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is a student with financial issues from their car damage.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is obligated to pay for the cremation. From a legal standpoint, in many places, if you hit an animal, you might be responsible for vet bills if it's injured, but if it's killed, maybe not. But laws vary. However, the author is asking if they're in the wrong morally or socially, not just legally.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially. They mention being a broke student with a $1k deductible. The dog owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author feels guilty and wants to help but can't afford it. They also note that the dog was let out before, implying maybe the owner was negligent in letting the dog roam. \n\nThere are arguments both ways. On one hand, the author caused the accident and might feel morally responsible to cover some costs. On the other hand, it was an accident, and the dog was allowed to roam, which is the owner's responsibility. The author's financial situation is a significant factor. \n\nIn some places, pet owners might expect compensation, but cremation and memorial costs aren't standard. The author might not have a legal obligation, but the social expectation could vary. Since the dog died instantly, the owner might not have a claim for ongoing costs, but the memorial is more about emotional value. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were at fault in causing the accident but had no control over the dog's sudden appearance. They're being asked for expenses beyond standard compensation. Also, the owner's negligence in letting the dog out could share some responsibility. The author's financial hardship adds context. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
