I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person was driving and accidentally hit a dog that ran out of a cornfield. The dog died instantly, and the owner was contacted. Now, the owner is asking the driver to pay for cremation and a memorial, which costs $150. The driver is a broke college student dealing with car repairs from the accident and can't afford this extra expense. They're conflicted between feeling guilty and not wanting to pay.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some liability. But usually, the owner is responsible for their pet being on the road. If the dog was a stray or frequently let loose, maybe the owner is at fault for not keeping the dog contained. The driver might not be legally obligated to pay for the cremation unless there's a specific law requiring it. But I'm not sure about the exact laws here, so maybe that's a point to consider.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The driver is remorseful and offered sympathy, which shows they care. However, they were in an accident that wasn't their fault\u2014they couldn't have avoided it. The owner is asking for money for the cremation and memorial, which isn't a medical expense but a sentimental one. The driver can't afford it and is already dealing with their own deductible. It's a matter of whether they have a moral obligation to pay for these items beyond the immediate costs.\n\nAlso, the fact that the dog was seen roaming before might indicate the owner wasn't keeping the dog secure. If the dog was off-leash in an area where cars are present, the owner might share some responsibility. So maybe the driver isn't entirely at fault here.\n\nAnother angle: the driver tried to do the right thing by contacting the owner and showing empathy. They didn't run off or ignore the situation. They even helped wrap the dog with an emergency blanket. The request for cremation costs seems like a financial burden on top of the car damage. The driver's financial situation is dire, so expecting them to pay might be unreasonable.\n\nBut then, some people might argue that since the driver caused the death, they should cover the costs of disposal, especially if local laws require it. However, if the owner is responsible for the dog's presence on the road, the driver might not have that obligation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the accident was unavoidable, the driver acted responsibly, and the owner may share some responsibility for the dog's presence. The driver is in a tough financial spot, so refusing to pay for the memorial isn't necessarily being in the wrong, especially if it's not legally required. Ethically, it's a tough call, but the driver isn't obligated to pay if it's not their legal responsibility and they've already shown remorse.\n"
