I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally killed. The options are A or B. I need to figure out the right answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the person hit a dog while driving. They were on a country road, and the dog came out of nowhere. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog's neck was broken instantly, so it was a quick death. They were very upset, comforted the owner, and the owner took the dog. Now, the owner is asking for $150 to cremate the dog and get a memorial. The author is a broke college student with a car insurance deductible of almost $1000, so they're struggling financially. They're conflicted between feeling guilty and not being able to afford it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to pay. \n\nLet me think about the legal and ethical angles. Legally, in most places, if you hit an animal while driving, you're not usually responsible for its medical or cremation costs unless you were at fault in a way that violates the law (like driving under the influence or recklessly). Since this was an accident, and the dog was on the road, the driver might not have a legal obligation to pay beyond possible car damages. However, if the dog was a working animal or the owner could prove negligence, maybe, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The author felt guilty and initially wanted to help, but their financial situation is dire. The owner is asking for memorial items, which are optional. The author argues that the dog was often roaming, which might imply some responsibility on the owner's part. So, if the owner is partially responsible for the dog being in a dangerous place, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nAlso, the author is already dealing with their own insurance costs. They mentioned being a broke college student. It's a matter of compassion versus practicality. Some might say that since the author caused the accident, they should contribute, while others might say it's not their legal responsibility and the owner should bear some responsibility for letting the dog roam.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if it's not legally required, some people might feel that showing compassion by paying for the cremation is the right thing to do. However, the author is in a tough spot financially. They might not be able to afford it without severe hardship. \n\nThe key points here are: accidental action, no evidence of negligence, owner's possible responsibility for the dog being on the road, and the financial strain on the author. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because legally they might not be obligated, and the situation was truly accidental. The owner's request for memorial items could be seen as an added expense that's not necessary, and the author's financial situation is a significant factor. The fact that the dog was often seen roaming suggests the owner might have contributed to the risk. However, there's also an argument for empathy and trying to help if possible, but given the author's circumstances, refusing isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
