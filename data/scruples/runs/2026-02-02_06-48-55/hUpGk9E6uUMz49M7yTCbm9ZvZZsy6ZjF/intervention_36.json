I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items of an animal they accidentally hit and killed with their car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if you hit an animal, you might be responsible for certain costs, but it's not always clear. The owner might have a claim for the animal's value, but memorials and cremation are more about sentimental value. Legally, the owner might not be entitled to those expenses unless there's a specific law. The author was driving, and the dog suddenly appeared. The driver might have followed traffic laws, so there's no negligence. That could mean the author isn't legally liable for the extra costs.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is genuinely remorseful and already offered apologies. They were emotional and tried to help by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner is asking for expenses that go beyond basic disposal. The author is a student with financial struggles and a damaged car. They might not have the means to pay. Ethically, while it's kind to help if you can, the author isn't at fault, so they might not be obligated. Also, the dog was let out before, so the owner might share some responsibility.\n\nThe author's reasons for not paying include the dog being a stray or frequently let out, their own financial hardship, and the accident being unavoidable. The owner's request for $150 for cremation and a memorial is reasonable from their perspective but maybe not legally enforceable. The author's guilt is real, but their situation is difficult.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They were not negligent, are facing financial loss from the car, and the owner's request is for sentimental expenses. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
