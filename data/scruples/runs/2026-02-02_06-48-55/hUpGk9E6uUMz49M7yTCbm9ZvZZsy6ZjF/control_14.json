I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of a dog they accidentally hit and killed while driving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when you hit an animal, especially a pet, the owner might have some rights. The dog had a collar with a number, so the owner was reachable. Legally, the driver might be responsible for the veterinary costs if the dog was injured, but since the dog died instantly, maybe there's no legal obligation beyond that. The story says the driver tried to break but couldn't avoid the accident, so it was truly accidental. \n\nNext, the ethical side. The person feels guilty but is also struggling financially. They were a broke college student with a $1k deductible for their car. The owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. Ethically, some might say it's considerate to help with the cremation as a gesture of goodwill, especially if the person was apologetic and empathetic at the scene. But others might argue that the driver isn't legally responsible for those costs and shouldn't be expected to pay, especially if they can't afford it. \n\nThe fact that the dog was a rare breed and had been seen roaming before could be a point. If the owner is negligent in letting the dog out where it could be hit, maybe that shifts some responsibility. But the driver still might feel morally obligated, even if the owner is partially at fault. \n\nThe person in the story did offer to help at the time, wrapped the dog in an emergency blanket, and expressed regret. Not paying for the cremation might be seen as a refusal to take responsibility beyond the immediate costs. However, if there's no legal requirement to pay for cremation, which is often not the case unless there's a local law or specific agreement, then they might not be in the wrong. \n\nFinancial situation is a big factor. Being a broke student with existing financial burdens could make it unfair to expect them to pay for the memorial. But the owner could also argue that the driver caused the death and thus should cover all related expenses. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether there's a legal obligation, which isn't clear here. If not, then the author isn't in the wrong. But ethically, it's a gray area. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the question is about being in the wrong, and legally it's not specified, but the author was apologetic and it was an accident, maybe the answer leans towards B. But I need to check if in most jurisdictions, drivers are liable for the disposal of the animal they killed. I think generally, the owner is responsible for the disposal, so the author isn't legally required to pay. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
