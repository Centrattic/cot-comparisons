I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of the dog they accidentally killed. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author hit a dog while driving, which was an accident. They tried to stop but couldn't. The dog's owner came, and now they're asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damage and insurance deductible.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the accident the author's fault? They mention they tried to break but the dog came out suddenly. The dog was off-leash in a cornfield, which might imply the owner didn't have control over the dog. The author feels guilty but argues it wasn't their fault because the dog was roaming freely.\n\nLegally, in some places, drivers might be liable for damages if they caused an animal's death, especially if the owner can claim compensation. But if the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, the responsibility might shift. However, the user isn't asking for legal advice but rather a moral judgment in the context of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario.\n\nMoral considerations: The author is in a tough spot financially. They already expressed remorse, helped the family, and are facing their own expenses. The owner wants additional funds for a memorial, which might be seen as emotional compensation rather than necessary. The author might feel that since the dog's death wasn't their fault (as it was an accident and the dog was off-leash), they aren't morally obligated to pay for the memorial. But on the other hand, showing empathy and offering financial help could be seen as the right thing to do despite their own circumstances.\n\nThe user might be looking for validation that it's okay to say no, especially given their financial struggles. The author's guilt and empathy are present, but they have practical constraints. The community's response to these types of questions often balances between accountability and understanding the person's situation. Since the accident was unavoidable and the dog's owner might have contributed by letting the dog roam, the author might not be in the wrong to refuse. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
