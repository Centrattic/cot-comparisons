I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe person hit a dog while driving, which they say was an accident. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog died instantly, and they felt really guilty, even crying and staying with the dog. They called the owner using the collar's number, and the owner came to get the dog. Now, the owner is asking the author to pay for the cremation and a memorial, totaling $150. The author is a broke college student with a $1000 deductible from their car insurance, so they're struggling financially. They're conflicted because they feel guilty but also think the dog might have been a stray or let out often, and it was an accident.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. If the dog was a pet, the owner is responsible for the dog's safety. If the dog ran into the road, the owner might be liable if the dog was off-leash in a place where that's not allowed. But the author hit the dog, so maybe there's some liability. However, in many places, drivers aren't typically responsible for pets in the road unless there's negligence on their part. The author says they tried to brake, so maybe they weren't at fault. But legally, it's not clear. However, the question isn't about legal wrong but moral/ethical wrong.\n\nEthically, the author caused the death. Even if it was an accident, they might feel a moral obligation to help with the costs. However, the author is in a tough financial situation. The owner is asking for cremation and memorial items, which are optional. The author could argue that the immediate costs (like the vet if the dog was alive) are their responsibility, but memorial items are beyond that. The author also mentions that the dog was seen roaming before, implying the owner might be negligent in letting the dog out. If the dog was a stray, maybe the owner isn't the rightful one, but the collar suggests ownership.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for refusing? Well, if they caused the death, maybe there's an expectation to cover some costs. But if it's an accident and they have no prior relationship with the owner, maybe it's not their responsibility. Also, the owner is asking for more than basic cremation\u2014memorial items could be seen as optional. The author's financial situation is dire, so they might not be able to afford it. However, showing some gesture of goodwill, even if not the full amount, might be expected. But the author is conflicted and hasn't responded yet. \n\nIn terms of what's \"wrong,\" if the author is completely refusing any payment, they might be seen as callous. But if they explain their situation and maybe offer partial help, that's different. The question is whether refusing to pay anything is wrong. The author's reasoning includes that the dog might have been allowed to roam, which could shift some responsibility to the owner. If the owner was negligent, then the author's liability is less. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They caused an accident, felt guilty, and the owner's request for memorial items might be beyond what's reasonably expected. The author's financial hardship is a factor. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
