I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hit and killed a dog while driving. They were on a country road, the dog came out of nowhere, and they couldn't stop in time. The dog's owner is asking them to pay for the cremation and some memorial items, totaling $150. The author is a broke college student with their own financial struggles from the car damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some liability. However, the owner is asking for specific expenses related to the disposal of the animal. Laws vary, but generally, the owner might be responsible for their pet's care and disposal unless there's a local law that holds drivers liable. If there's no law requiring this, the owner might not have a legal claim for the cremation costs. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author feels guilty and has already shown remorse by apologizing and being emotional. They tried to help by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner is asking for more money for a memorial. The author argues that the dog was often seen roaming, which might imply the owner wasn't keeping it secured. That could affect responsibility\u2014maybe the owner is partially at fault for letting the dog roam free where it could be hit by a car. \n\nFinancially, the author is struggling. They have a deductible from the car accident and are a student. Paying $150 might be a real burden. Even if they wanted to be kind, they might not be able to afford it. But some might argue that showing empathy and helping with the memorial is important, regardless of financial strain. \n\nAlso, the author did contact the owner, took responsibility, and was apologetic. They didn't try to run away or deny the accident. The owner's request might be more about emotional closure than compensation. But the author isn't legally obligated, and morally, it's a gray area. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were in an accident, took responsibility, and are facing their own consequences. The owner's request might be reasonable in terms of empathy, but the author has valid reasons not to pay, especially if there's no legal obligation and the dog was often unattended. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
