I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's start by understanding the situation. The author hit a dog while driving, which resulted in the dog's death. The dog was on a collar with a number, so the owner was contacted. The owner wants the author to pay for cremation and a memorial, which costs $150. The author is a broke college student, had car damage leading to a $1k deductible, and feels it was an accident since the dog suddenly appeared.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by refusing to pay. Legally, in many places, if a driver is found at fault for an accident, they might be responsible for damages, including the animal's death. However, the author claims it was an accident with no way to prevent it, and the dog was let out frequently. The owner might argue that the driver should cover the cost as they were the one who caused the death.\n\nEthically, the author is torn between guilt and financial hardship. They expressed remorse, provided an emergency blanket, and apologized. But the owner is asking for a specific amount for cremation and memorial. The author's financial situation is dire, so they might not be able to afford it. But there's a question of responsibility here. Even if the dog was at fault for being on the road, the driver's actions (like maintaining the car and driving safely) could be factors. \n\nIn terms of moral obligation, some might say the author should contribute as it's a gesture of goodwill. Others might argue that the owner is being unreasonable, especially if the dog was a stray or often let out. The author might not have the means, and the law might not require them to pay for cremation and memorials unless there's a specific regulation. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, it's possible the author is responsible, but maybe not for the memorial. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author's arguments about the dog being loose and their own financial state are valid. The answer might hinge on local laws and whether the owner is justified in seeking compensation for things beyond immediate vet costs (like cremation). Since the dog died instantly and the author acted compassionately, the responsibility for the memorial might not be theirs. Given all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing the memorial expenses, especially with their financial situation. So the answer is B.\n"
