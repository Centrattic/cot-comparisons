I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who accidentally killed the dog is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation and memorial costs.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person hit the dog while driving, which was an accident. They tried to stop but couldn't. They felt awful, they were emotional, and they even tried to comfort the owner. Now, the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is broke, a student, with their own car damage costs.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the legal and ethical aspects.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you cause an animal's death while driving, you might be responsible for certain costs, but I think it's usually up to the owner to prove negligence. Since this was an accident and the dog was off the road, maybe there's no legal obligation. But I'm not 100% sure on that. Also, the owner might not have a legal claim for things like the memorial items unless there's some specific law about it.\n\nEthically, even if not legally required, some people might feel you should cover the basic disposal costs out of respect. However, the memorial items are optional, so that's more about sentiment. The author is in a tough financial spot, and the owner does know the dog was often outside, which might contribute to shared responsibility.\n\nThe author did take responsibility by apologizing and being there emotionally. They might feel they did enough. The owner's request is for extra items beyond the basic cremation. If the author can't afford it, is it fair to expect them to pay? Also, the author is a student with their own deductible from the car accident.\n\nI think the key points are: accident, not negligent, financial hardship, and the owner's dog being frequently outside. The author isn't in the wrong because it was an accident, and they already showed remorse. The request for memorial items might be seen as an added expense not legally required. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
