I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of a dog they accidentally hit. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was driving and hit a dog that ran out suddenly. The dog died instantly. The owner came, and now they're asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is broke, a student, and already dealing with car repairs.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, if you hit someone's pet, you might be responsible for damages. But pets aren't usually considered property in the same way, so laws vary. The author might not have legal obligation, but ethically?\n\nEthically, it's more about responsibility. The author caused the accident, even if it was unintentional. They expressed guilt and sorrow. But they also mention that the dog was seen roaming before. Maybe the owner was negligent in letting the dog out. That could shift some responsibility.\n\nThe financial aspect is a big factor. The author is struggling, and the cost is significant. But the owner is asking for specific services. Should the author be expected to cover that even if it's a financial burden? Maybe there's a middle ground, like offering partial payment or a donation to a charity in the dog's name if they can't afford the full amount.\n\nThe community might have different views. Some might say the author should pay as it's their fault, others might agree that it's an accident and the owner should cover their own costs. The author's financial situation is a mitigating factor here.\n\nAlso, the author already did what they could: offered sympathy, helped wrap the dog, and apologized. The request for cremation is an additional cost. It's not like medical bills for the dog because it died instantly. So maybe the author isn't responsible beyond the immediate costs like towing and repairs.\n\nBut then again, if you cause a pet's death, some people believe you should cover the disposal costs as a sign of respect and responsibility. However, if the pet was allowed to roam freely, the owner might share some responsibility.\n\nI think it's a gray area. Legally, maybe not obligated. Ethically, it's a toss-up. The author's guilt and the owner's emotional request play into it. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author refuses, some might say they're being selfish, others might see it as reasonable given the circumstances. But I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because it was an accident, the dog was roaming, and they're financially strained. So answer B.\n"
