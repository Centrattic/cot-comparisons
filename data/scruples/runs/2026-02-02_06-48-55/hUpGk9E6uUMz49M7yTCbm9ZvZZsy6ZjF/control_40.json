I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author hit a dog that ran into the road, which was an accident. They were already in a tough spot with their car damage and insurance deductible. The dog's owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student, so paying that could be a big burden.\n\nLegally, maybe they're not responsible beyond the car damage? When you hit an animal, the liability can vary. If the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, the owner might be partly responsible. But the author does have some responsibility since they caused the accident, even if it was unintentional. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. The author expressed genuine remorse and even tried to comfort the family. They didn't want to pay for the cremation, but they have financial struggles. The owner might be making a reasonable request, but the author's situation is tough. \n\nThe main factors here are intent, responsibility, and financial capability. The author didn't do it on purpose, but they might still be expected to cover some costs. However, the owner might not have a legal claim for the cremation costs beyond the car damage. If the dog was allowed to roam, the owner could be at fault for not keeping the dog secured. \n\nIn some places, you might be liable for the animal's death if you hit it, but the costs of the cremation might be considered an additional expense. The author is already dealing with their insurance, so maybe the cremation is beyond that. \n\nThe author's reasons for not paying include the dog being let out, their own financial state, and it being an accident. They feel guilty but also it's not entirely their fault. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the law doesn't require them to pay for the cremation, then maybe not. But if there's an expectation of covering all damages caused by their accident, then yes. However, since the owner might be at fault for the dog being on the road, the author might not be responsible for the extra costs. \n\nGiven that the author acted with empathy and the financial situation is dire, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), but I need to check if there's a legal obligation. If there's no legal requirement, then B. If there's an ethical expectation despite the financial strain, then A. But since the dog's owner might be partly responsible, the author isn't entirely to blame. So, B makes sense here.\n"
