I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally killed. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author hit the dog while driving, it was an accident, and the dog died instantly. The owner is asking for $150 for cremation and memorial items. The author is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the car damage.\n\nSo, legally, I'm not sure. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some responsibility. But usually, the owner is responsible for the pet's care and any costs related to its death, unless there's negligence on the driver's part. The author mentions they were driving on a country road and the dog suddenly came out. They tried to brake, so there's no indication of reckless driving. The dog was off-leash in a cornfield, so maybe the owner is responsible for the dog's wandering. That could be a key point. \n\nThe author is feeling guilty but is in a tough financial situation. They already have car repairs to handle. The question is about moral responsibility. The owner wants compensation for cremation and a memorial. Is that reasonable? Cremation is a way to handle the remains, which might be necessary if the owner can't do it themselves. But a memorial stone and vase are optional. The author might argue that basic cremation is different from additional items. \n\nAlso, the author did cover the immediate costs by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket and showing empathy. They expressed remorse and helped the family. Now the request is for more expenses. The author's reasons for refusing are that the dog was often roaming (so owner's responsibility), their financial state, and the accident was unavoidable. \n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, the driver might be liable for the value of the animal, but not necessarily for burial or cremation costs unless specified. If the dog was a stray or frequently off-leash, the owner might have contributed to the situation. \n\nMorally, the author is conflicted. They feel guilty but also think the family might be asking for more than necessary. The author is in a tough spot and might not have the means to pay. The owner's request for a memorial might be seen as exploiting the guilt of the accident. \n\nSo, putting it together, the author might not be in the wrong because the accident was unavoidable, the dog's owner allowed it to roam, and the author is already dealing with their own damages. The memorial items are optional and not a standard cost. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
