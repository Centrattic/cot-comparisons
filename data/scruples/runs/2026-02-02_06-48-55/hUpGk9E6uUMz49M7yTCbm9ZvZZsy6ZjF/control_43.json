I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person hit a dog accidentally and now the owner is asking them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. If the person was driving responsibly and the accident was truly unavoidable, maybe there's no legal obligation to pay for the cremation. Usually, when someone is injured in an accident, the liable party might have to cover medical bills, but animals aren't people. The owner might not have a legal claim for the cremation costs unless there's some specific law about it.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is really upset about the incident, showed empathy by apologizing and comforting the family. They're also in a tough financial situation. However, the owner is asking for memorial expenses. Some might argue that the person who caused the death should contribute to the memorial as a gesture of goodwill. But others might say it's not their responsibility, especially since the accident was unavoidable and the dog was off-leash.\n\nThe owner's dog was seen roaming before, which might imply that the owner wasn't keeping the dog secure. That could shift some responsibility to the owner for the dog being in the road. If the dog was off-leash in an area where it's not allowed, the owner might be at fault for letting the dog roam freely.\n\nFinancially, the author is a broke student with a damaged car and deductible. They might not have the means to pay for the cremation. It's a tough spot, but does that absolve them of responsibility? Not necessarily, but it's a factor in their decision-making.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people do offer to cover such costs out of sympathy, but it's not a legal requirement. The author's conflict between guilt and financial inability is real. They want to express remorse but can't afford to pay. It's possible that negotiating a smaller amount or offering something else (like a donation to a pet charity) could be a middle ground, but the owner is asking for a specific amount.\n\nIn summary, the legal obligation is likely not there, the moral obligation is debatable, and the owner's responsibility for the dog's presence in the road might reduce the author's liability. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing.\n"
