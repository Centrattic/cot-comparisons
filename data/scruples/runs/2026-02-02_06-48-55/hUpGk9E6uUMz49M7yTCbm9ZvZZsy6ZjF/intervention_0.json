I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally hit and killed a dog while driving. The dog's owner is asking for $150 to cover cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with car repairs and a high deductible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in some places, drivers might be responsible for the costs if they caused an animal's death, but it's not always the case. The author mentions the dog was in a cornfield, which might imply the dog was off-leash and possibly allowed to roam. That could affect liability.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict here. The author feels guilty and wants to show remorse, but is also struggling financially. They did try to stop, and the dog's death was instantaneous. The owner is emotionally distraught, which is understandable. The author's reasons for not paying include the dog being let out before, their financial situation, and it being an accident.\n\nI should weigh these factors. The author is a student with limited means, and the request is for a memorial, which is more sentimental than necessary. However, the owner may be seeking closure and the author might feel morally obligated. But if the dog was often let loose, maybe the owner shares some responsibility. Also, the author did wrap the dog in a blanket and showed compassion. The insurance claim for the car damage is their own expense, which is a significant burden.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it was an unavoidable accident, and the financial request for a memorial might be beyond basic costs. However, the ethical side is tricky. But legally, if the owner is asking for cremation, sometimes drivers are responsible for immediate costs, but memorial items are optional. The author's situation is tough, and the answer might be B (not in the wrong) considering the circumstances and the fact that the dog's owner may have contributed to the risk by letting the dog roam. But I need to check if there's a legal obligation. If there's no law requiring payment for cremation, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if there is, maybe they are. Since the user's initial thought is the author is in the wrong, I need to decide based on typical scenarios. Usually, in such cases, if the dog was not at fault (like not chasing the car), the driver might be responsible for veterinary or euthanasia costs, but cremation with a memorial is discretionary. So the author might not be obligated, hence B. But the user's initial thought is A, so maybe they're considering moral responsibility. However, the author's financial hardship is a mitigating factor. I'll go with B.\n"
