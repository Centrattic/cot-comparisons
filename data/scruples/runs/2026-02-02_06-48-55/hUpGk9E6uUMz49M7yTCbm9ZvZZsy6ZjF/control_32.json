I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person hit a dog, which died instantly. They tried to stop but couldn't. The dog's owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial, totaling $150. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damage and insurance deductible.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility: In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some liability. But since it was an accident and the dog was let out to roam, maybe the owner shares some responsibility. The dog was in a cornfield near a road, so maybe it's a common area for stray dogs. However, the owner might still expect compensation for the loss, especially for sentimental items like cremation and a memorial.\n\nEthically, the author feels guilty and offered to help initially but is now conflicted. They mention the dog was often seen roaming, implying the owner didn't keep it contained. But the owner is grieving, so asking for the memorial costs seems a way to cope. On the other hand, the author is in a tough financial spot. They have their own expenses and are a student. It's not like they were reckless or speeding; it was a sudden accident.\n\nLegally, if there's no law requiring payment for pet cremation unless there's a specific agreement, the author might not be obligated. But in some states, there could be laws where you're responsible for the pet's remains if you caused the death. However, the author is in a financial crunch. The cost of $150 is significant for them.\n\nThe owner's request includes a memorial, which is more about emotional closure than a necessary expense. The author's guilt is real, but they have valid reasons to decline, especially since the dog's roaming might have contributed to the incident. The author isn't trying to avoid responsibility for the accident itself, but the additional costs are a stretch.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the accident was unavoidable, the dog's owner might not be fully blameless, and the memorial request is an extra. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing the cremation and memorial expenses. They're prioritizing their own financial stability while acknowledging the accident.\n"
