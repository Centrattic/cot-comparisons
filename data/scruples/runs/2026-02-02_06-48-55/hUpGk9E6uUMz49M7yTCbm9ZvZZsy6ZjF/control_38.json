I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe person hit the dog accidentally, tried to avoid it, and felt guilty. They called the owner, who was emotional, and offered sympathy. Now the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student, has a deductible from the car damage, and the dog was a stray.\n\nHmm, legal responsibilities here. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be responsible for damages. But since the dog was running loose, maybe the owner is also at fault for not keeping the dog contained. The author tried to avoid it, so it was an accident. Financially, the author can't afford more expenses. \n\nEthically, the author felt bad and offered sympathy. The owner is asking for more money beyond the initial incident. The author might not have legal obligation if the dog was a stray, but maybe morally? The story mentions the dog was seen roaming before. So, the owner may have contributed to the situation by not keeping the dog. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially. If the law doesn't require payment, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if there's a legal duty, maybe they are. However, since the dog was a stray, maybe not. The answer likely depends on local laws, but since the question is about being in the wrong, legally or morally. Here, the author did their best to avoid it, showed remorse, and the dog wasn't in a controlled environment. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
