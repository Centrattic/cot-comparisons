I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not paying for the cremation and memorial items after accidentally killing a dog.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hit the dog accidentally while driving. They tried to break but couldn't avoid it. The dog was found to have a collar with a number, so they contacted the owner. The owner came, took the dog, and now wants the author to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with financial struggles from their car accident.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. In many places, there's no legal obligation to pay for cremation of an animal unless there's a specific law. The author isn't the owner, so maybe they aren't legally responsible beyond compensation for any injuries or property damage. But since the dog was hit, maybe there's a different consideration.\n\nEthically, the author feels guilty and is conflicted. They want to show remorse but can't afford it. The family is asking for a specific amount for cremation and a memorial. On one hand, the author is in a tight spot financially. On the other, the family is grieving and wants to honor their pet. \n\nThe author mentions that the dog was seen roaming before, which might imply the owner was aware of the dog's tendency to be outside. That could affect responsibility. If the owner knew the dog was running loose, maybe they share some responsibility for the dog's death.\n\nAlso, the author already offered sympathy and help by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. They expressed guilt and apologized. So maybe they've done enough in terms of emotional support. The monetary request is separate. Since the author is struggling financially, expecting them to pay might be unreasonable.\n\nBut some might argue that taking responsibility includes covering the cremation. However, unless there's a legal obligation, it's more of a moral choice. The author isn't at fault legally, just in the unfortunate accident. So they aren't in the wrong for refusing if they can't afford it, especially considering their own financial issues.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, no obligation. Ethically, it's a gray area, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for saying no, especially with their circumstances. The family's request is emotional, but the author isn't responsible beyond their means. Therefore, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
