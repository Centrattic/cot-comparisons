I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is they hit a dog, it died, and now the owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The writer is a broke college student dealing with car repairs and deductible costs.\n\nFirst, the accident happened. The person was driving, and even though they tried to brake, the dog came out of nowhere. So it's an accident, not intentional. The writer felt terrible, helped out, wrapped the dog in a blanket, and apologized. The owner was upset, but the dog was already dead. \n\nNow, the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The writer is struggling financially. They have a deductible for the car, which is expensive, and they're a student. They feel guilt but also think the dog was let out before, which might be the owner's responsibility. \n\nSo the question is, should the writer pay? Legally, maybe they're not obligated unless there's a law that requires it. But morally, it's a gray area. The person caused the accident, so maybe they should contribute. However, the owner might have some responsibility if they let the dog roam. The writer is in a tough spot financially. \n\nSome people might say the owner is being unreasonable because the accident wasn't their fault, but others might argue that the driver should still help with the memorial. Since the dog was already dead, the cremation is an added expense. The writer is in an accident, which is covered by insurance, but the deductible is their own. If the writer is already paying for car repairs, maybe they can't afford more. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. They didn't do it on purpose, and the financial burden is significant. So the correct answer would be B (No).\n"
