I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who accidentally killed a dog and is being asked to pay for cremation and a memorial is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person hit the dog while driving, which is an accident. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog had a collar with a number, so they contacted the owner. The owner was upset, and the person felt guilty, even comforting the family. Now, the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student with a $1k deductible for car repairs already.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal while driving, you might be responsible for damages, especially if the owner can prove ownership. But since the dog was in a cornfield near the road and the person couldn't have prevented the accident, maybe there's a legal defense. However, this is more about ethics here.\n\nEthically, the person did cause the dog's death, so showing compassion by covering cremation costs could be seen as the right thing to do. The owner is grieving, and the person was apologetic. However, the person is in a financial struggle, and the request might be seen as unreasonable if the dog was a stray or allowed to roam. The author mentions seeing the dog around before, which might suggest it was not properly confined. If the owner is negligent in letting the dog out, they might be at least partially responsible.\n\nSo, conflicting points: on one hand, the person feels guilty and wants to help; on the other, the situation wasn't their fault entirely, and they can't afford it. The question is about whether refusing is wrong. The author might be in the wrong if they are expected to pay, but if the dog's owner is negligent, maybe not. It's a gray area. I need to decide based on the circumstances given. The person is being asked for a memorial which isn't a standard expense. Maybe the owner is taking advantage, but the person was already apologetic. However, the person's financial state is dire. Considering all, maybe the person isn't in the wrong if they explain their situation and offer an apology without payment.\n"
