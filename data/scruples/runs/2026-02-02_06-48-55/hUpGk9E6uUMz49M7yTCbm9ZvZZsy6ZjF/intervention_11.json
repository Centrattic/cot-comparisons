I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person hit a dog while driving, which is tragic. They tried to brake but the dog came out of nowhere. The dog's owner is asking for $150 to cover cremation and a memorial. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: In some places, if you hit an animal, you might be responsible for damages, but laws vary. Since the dog was on the road and the collision was an accident, maybe there's no legal obligation. The author isn't a vet or expert, so they can't be expected to predict the dog's movements. The dog owner might be responsible if they let the dog roam freely.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels guilty and is already paying for their car repairs, which is costly. They're a student with financial struggles. The owner received the dog back, and the author showed remorse by comforting the family. The request for a memorial is additional, and the author might not have a legal or ethical duty to cover that, especially if the dog was often let out. The owner's emotional pain is real, but the cost is significant. The author might not be at fault since it's an accident, and they can't control the dog's actions. So, from a legal and moral standpoint, they might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a social expectation to help, but given their financial situation, it's a tough call. The owner should handle the memorial themselves, as it's their pet. The author isn't responsible for the dog's roaming. So, answer B.\n"
