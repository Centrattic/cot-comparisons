I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of the dog they accidentally killed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author hit the dog by accident while driving, and the dog died instantly. They felt guilty, apologized, and tried to be helpful by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner then asked for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with financial strain from their car's deductible.\n\nLegally, in many places, the driver might be responsible for damages if they were at fault. However, since it was an accident and the dog was on the road, there might be complexities. The owner might not be able to claim full compensation if the driver was not negligent. But legally, that's a gray area and would depend on local laws.\n\nEthically, the author is torn between their financial situation and the desire to show remorse. They've already taken steps to be considerate, like apologizing and helping with the immediate aftermath. The cost for cremation and memorial might be seen as optional by the author, who isn't legally obligated. The owner might feel entitled to some compensation, but the author's financial hardship is real.\n\nThe key points are: accident, immediate remorse, financial struggle, and the cost for cremation and memorial. The author argues that the dog was a stray or let out often, which might imply some responsibility on the owner's part. If the dog was allowed to roam freely, the owner might share some blame for the incident.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the author caused the accident, it was unintentional. The request for additional expenses beyond immediate costs (like medical) is where the debate lies. Cremation and memorials are more about the owner's sentimental value, not medical bills. So the author might feel they aren't responsible for those extra costs, especially when they can't afford it.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's refusal might be seen as justified given their financial situation and the fact that the accident wasn't their fault. However, some might argue that showing compassion by contributing something is expected, even if it's not required. But given the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
