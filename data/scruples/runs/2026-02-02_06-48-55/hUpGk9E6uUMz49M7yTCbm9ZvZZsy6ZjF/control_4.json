I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was driving and hit a dog that suddenly ran onto the road. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog died instantly. The owner was informed, and now she's asking the driver to cover cremation and memorial costs totaling $150. The driver is a broke college student dealing with car repairs and a $1k deductible, so they can't afford to pay.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing. Let's consider legal and moral aspects. \n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, if you cause an accident that results in the death of someone's pet, you might be liable. However, pets aren't considered property in the same way as, say, a car. There's a concept called \"negligence,\" but if the driver was not at fault (like the dog just ran into the road unexpectedly), they might not be legally obligated to pay for cremation beyond the actual damages. But some places have different laws regarding pets. The driver might be responsible for veterinary bills if the dog had survived, but since it died instantly, the owner might not have any medical costs. However, the cremation and memorial are considered emotional expenses, which are usually not covered unless there's a specific law or a prior agreement. \n\nMoral aspect is trickier. The driver expressed genuine remorse and is in financial hardship. The owner wants the driver to pay for memorial items, which are not essential. The driver isn't a malicious person; it was a tragic accident. The owner might be seeking emotional compensation, but expecting someone in financial trouble to pay for that could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the dog was often seen roaming, which might imply the owner didn't have strict control, possibly contributing to the accident. However, that doesn't necessarily absolve the driver, but it adds context. \n\nThe driver has already dealt with the immediate aftermath, provided comfort, and is handling the insurance. They aren't avoiding responsibility entirely but are struggling to pay for additional costs they can't afford. \n\nIn similar cases, people often feel morally obligated to help if they can, but if they can't, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The key factors are whether the driver was negligent and if the costs are reasonable. Since it was an accident and the memorial is optional, refusing might be understandable. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, maybe not obligated. Morally, it's a grey area but the driver's financial situation and the nature of the costs suggest they aren't in the wrong for refusing.\n"
