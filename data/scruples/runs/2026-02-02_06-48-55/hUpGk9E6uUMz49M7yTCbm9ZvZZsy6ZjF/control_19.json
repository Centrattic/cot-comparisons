I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of a dog they accidentally killed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, if you accidentally hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some legal responsibility. But usually, the owner is responsible for their pets. If the dog was off-leash and ran into the road, the owner might share some responsibility. The writer mentioned that the dog had been seen roaming before, implying it wasn't the first time. So maybe the owner isn't entirely blameless.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The writer is feeling guilty and even cried, showing they care. They did offer sympathy and tried to help by wrapping the dog in a blanket. But the owner is now asking for money for cremation and a memorial. Legally, is the writer obligated to pay for that? Typically, if you cause an accident, you might cover medical costs or property damage, but memorial expenses might be considered emotional compensation, which isn't always required by law. It's more of a personal or ethical decision.\n\nFinancial situation is another factor. The writer is a broke college student with their own deductible to pay. They might not be able to afford the $150. But does that matter? If someone is responsible for another's loss, sometimes they're expected to help, but if it's a stretch financially, maybe it's unreasonable to expect it.\n\nAlso, the accident was truly unforeseen. The dog came out suddenly, and the writer reacted as best as they could. There's no indication of negligence on their part. So legally, maybe they're not at fault beyond basic liability for the car damage.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that being compassionate means offering to help with the memorial, but others might say it's not their responsibility, especially if the owner isn't at fault themselves. But since the dog was allowed to roam, maybe the owner shares some blame.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the writer might not be obligated to pay for the memorial. Ethically, it's a gray area, but since the owner's negligence (letting the dog roam) contributed, the writer isn't entirely at fault. The financial strain is another point against expecting them to pay. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
