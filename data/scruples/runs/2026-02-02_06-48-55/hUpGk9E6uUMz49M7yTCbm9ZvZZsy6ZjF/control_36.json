I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person hit the dog while driving. The dog died instantly, which is a tragic accident. The owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damage and deductible, which is a $1k hit. They feel guilty but also think the dog was often let out, which might be a factor.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal, especially a domestic one, there might be some responsibility. But since the dog was on the road and the accident was unavoidable, maybe there's no legal obligation. The owner's request is likely emotional, not legal. The author is in a tough financial spot, so refusing might be understandable.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author feels guilty and wants to help but can't afford it. On one hand, showing compassion by contributing could help the owner. On the other hand, they have their own financial issues. The owner might have insurance for the pet, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nThe story mentions the dog had a collar with a number, so the owner was easily contactable. The author tried to be empathetic, offered apologies, and helped wrap the dog. The owner and kids were upset, which adds to the emotional weight.\n\nBut the author's argument is that the dog was often seen roaming, so maybe the owner is partly responsible for letting the dog out near a road. Also, the author's financial situation is dire, so they can't afford extra expenses.\n\nIn similar situations, like hitting a deer, you usually don't have to pay for the animal's disposal. So this might be similar. The owner's request for cremation is a personal choice, not a necessary expense. The author isn't at fault legally, so they're not in the wrong for refusing. They can still be compassionate by offering something they can afford, but they aren't obligated to pay the full amount.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are in a difficult situation and the request isn't legally binding. Their refusal is understandable given their circumstances.\n"
