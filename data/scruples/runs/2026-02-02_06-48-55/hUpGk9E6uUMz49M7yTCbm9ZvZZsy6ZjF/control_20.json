I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author hit a dog that ran into the road. The dog died instantly. The owner came, took the dog, and now wants the author to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with their own deductible from car damage.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, the owner might have a claim for the animal's value. But cremation and memorial costs are more about sentimental value. The author didn't cause the dog to be let off the leash; the owner might be responsible for the dog being loose. \n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly upset and has shown remorse. They tried to help, wrapped the dog in an emergency blanket, and apologized. The owner also seemed to accept that, as they didn't press charges or anything. \n\nThe author's financial situation is tough. They're a student with a $1k deductible. The request for $150 could be a lot for them. But the owner might feel entitled to some compensation for the loss. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. Normally, if you cause harm, you might be expected to cover some costs, but this is a pet. There's no legal obligation in many places to cover cremation. However, some people might argue that showing compassion by contributing is the right thing. \n\nThe author feels it's an accident and not their fault. The dog was roaming, so maybe the owner is partially at fault. The author's guilt is evident, but they're not willing to pay for the memorial. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the law doesn't require it, and the owner isn't seeking compensation beyond the dog's value, then maybe not. But if the author can afford a small amount, maybe they should contribute. However, given their financial situation, refusing isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since it's an accident, and the author showed remorse, and the dog's owner might be at fault for letting the dog roam, the author isn't necessarily wrong. So answer B.\n"
