I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author was driving and hit a dog that ran onto the road. They were going home on a country road, and the dog came from a cornfield. The author tried to brake but couldn't avoid the accident. The dog's owner arrived, and they all cried. Now, the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial.\n\nThe author is a broke college student, dealing with a car repair deductible of nearly $1000. They argue that the dog was often seen roaming loose, so the owner might be at least partially responsible. They also feel it was a genuine accident beyond their control.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, if you hit an animal, the owner might have a claim for the animal's value, but memorials like cremation and a paw print stone might be considered optional and not a legal obligation. However, this can vary by jurisdiction. The author isn't being asked for the dog's value but for additional memorial expenses. \n\nEthically, the author is remorseful and expressed sympathy. They took responsibility by notifying the owner and were upset by the incident. However, they're facing financial hardship. The owner's request for extra expenses beyond just the cremation (like the memorial stone) might be seen as an emotional appeal rather than a necessary cost. \n\nThe author's arguments include the dog's frequent roaming, their own financial struggles, and the accident being unavoidable. The key points here are whether the author has a legal obligation and whether ethically they should cover these extra costs. Since the dog's owner might be responsible for the animal's presence on the road, the author's liability could be limited. \n\nIn many cases, people might feel empathy and offer to help with cremation costs as a gesture of goodwill, but if the author can't afford it and the request is for non-essential memorials, it's reasonable for them to decline. The author isn't being callous; they're genuinely conflicted and have shown remorse. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014legal obligations are unclear, the owner's possible responsibility for the dog's roaming, the author's financial situation, and the optional nature of the memorial items\u2014the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
