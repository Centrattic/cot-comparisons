I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit. The situation is that the author was driving and hit a dog that ran onto the road. The dog died instantly, and the owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial, totaling $150. The author is a broke college student with their own car damage costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some liability. But typically, the owner is responsible for the animal being on the road. However, laws vary by jurisdiction. The author mentions the dog was let out before, so maybe the owner is at fault for not keeping the dog contained. But legally, it's not clear without knowing the specific state or country laws.\n\nEthically, the author feels guilty and is conflicted. They offered sympathy and tried to help by wrapping the dog. However, they're being asked for additional expenses beyond immediate costs. The owner is asking for cremation and a memorial, which are more about emotional closure than necessary expenses. The author is in a tough financial spot, so can they be blamed for not being able to pay?\n\nMoral responsibility: The author caused the accident, even if it was accidental. Some might argue that they should contribute to the burial/cremation as a gesture of goodwill. Others might say that since it was an accident and the owner is at fault for the dog being on the road, the author isn't obligated.\n\nFinancial hardship is a factor. The author is a student with their own deductible to pay. Forcing them to pay $150 could be a significant burden. But if the owner expects compensation for the loss, even if not legally required, the author might feel pressured.\n\nSo, the answer depends on legal responsibility versus moral obligation. If legally the author isn't required, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if there's an ethical duty to help, then maybe they are. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more moral than legal, but the user might be considering both.\n\nIn many cases, when you cause an accident, even if it's not your fault entirely, people expect you to cover reasonable costs. Cremation could be considered reasonable, but the memorial items might be extra. The author could offer to cover the cremation but not the memorial, but the owner is bundling it as $150. The author's financial situation complicates things. They might be in the wrong if they have the means but refuse, but if they truly can't afford it, maybe not.\n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because it was an accident, the dog was on the road, and the owner's request includes non-essential items. The author is already covering their guilt through sympathy and is in a tough spot financially.\n"
