I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally killed. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hit a dog while driving, which was an accident. The dog was a stray, at least according to the author's observation since they've seen the dog around before. The owner now wants the author to pay for cremation and a memorial, which costs $150. The author is a college student with financial struggles, dealing with a car insurance deductible and living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent, legal responsibility, and moral obligation. Legally, in many places, if you hit an animal while driving, especially another person's pet, you might be held responsible. However, if the dog was roaming freely, maybe the owner is also negligent. The author mentions seeing the dog around before, implying the dog might be let loose often. That could shift some responsibility to the owner for not keeping their pet contained.\n\nMoral obligation is trickier. The author is clearly remorseful, crying, and felt guilty. They even offered sympathy and support to the owner. But does that translate to a financial obligation? If the accident was truly unavoidable, maybe the author isn't morally obligated to pay for the memorial, especially if the owner was negligent. However, some might argue that taking responsibility includes covering the costs, regardless of the owner's actions.\n\nFinancial hardship is another aspect. The author is a student with limited funds and already facing a $1k deductible. Adding $150 could be burdensome. But is that a valid reason to refuse? Maybe, but it's not an ethical consideration\u2014it's a practical one.\n\nLegally, it's possible that the author could be required to pay, but if it's a private matter without legal enforcement, it's up to negotiation. The author isn't in the wrong legally if the owner's negligence is a factor. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author did their part by being empathetic and trying to help in the moment. The memorial is optional and more about sentimental value than necessity.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were responsible in the moment, the dog's owner might share some blame, and the financial situation is a real constraint. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
