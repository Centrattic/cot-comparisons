I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items of a dog they accidentally hit and killed.\n\nFirst, the situation is an accident. The driver was on a country road, the dog came out of nowhere, and they couldn't avoid hitting it. The dog's neck was broken instantly, so it wasn't in pain, which they mentioned to the owner. The owner was emotional, and the driver felt guilty and tried to be helpful by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket.\n\nNow, the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The driver is a broke college student with their own financial issues (car damage, insurance deductible). They're conflicted between feeling guilty and not being able to afford it.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal, the owner might be able to claim compensation, but it's often up to negotiation. However, the driver can argue it was an unavoidable accident, and maybe the dog was off-leash as suggested by the fact that they've seen it roaming before. Ethically, it's a gray area. Showing empathy is important, but the driver's financial situation is dire. \n\nThe key points are: accident was unavoidable, the dog was not leashed, driver is financially strained. The owner might expect compensation, but the driver isn't at fault beyond the accident. The answer hinges on whether the driver is morally obligated to pay despite the circumstances. Since the driver can't afford it and the accident wasn't their fault, they might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
