I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they accidentally hit and killed someone's dog while driving. The dog was in a cornfield nearby, and they tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The owner now wants them to pay for the cremation and some memorial items, totaling $150. The author is a broke college student dealing with car damage and insurance costs, so they're considering refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Generally, when someone causes the death of an animal due to their negligence, there might be some liability. But was the author negligent here? They were on a country road, the dog suddenly came out. If they were driving at a reasonable speed and couldn't avoid it, maybe there's no legal obligation to pay for cremation. But sometimes states have specific laws about this. However, the question is more about moral/ethical wrong, not legal.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author feels guilty and has shown compassion by apologizing and helping. The owner is asking for money for the cremation and memorial. Is the author obligated to pay? Well, the author didn't own the dog, but they caused its death. In some cases, people might feel it's the right thing to do, but others might argue it's the owner's responsibility. The author's financial situation is a key factor here. They are a student with a high deductible and already in financial trouble. They might not be able to afford it. \n\nThen there's the fact that the dog was seen roaming before. If the owner is at fault for letting the dog out where it could be hit, maybe the author's responsibility is lessened. However, as a driver, you have a duty to avoid hitting animals if possible. But if it was truly unavoidable, maybe they aren't at fault.\n\nThe author has already expressed remorse, which is important. The owner might be seeking closure through the memorial, but the author can't afford it. Is it ethical to ask for money for a memorial? Maybe the owner is trying to get compensation beyond just the incident. \n\nIn WIBTA (Would I Blame The Author) terms, the community often considers intentions, actions, and circumstances. The author acted responsibly at the scene, showed empathy, and now is struggling to decide whether to pay. Since it was an accident, and they're financially strained, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). They didn't act recklessly, and the memorial is an added expense. The owner could be expected to handle the cremation as part of their own loss. However, some might argue that taking responsibility includes covering the costs. But given the author's situation and the accident's unavoidable nature, B is likely the answer.\n"
