I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user accidentally hit a dog, which was a tragic accident. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog had a broken neck and died instantly. The owner came, got the dog, and now wants the user to pay for cremation and a memorial. The user is a broke college student dealing with car damage and insurance deductible.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility: In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be liable for certain costs. But it's not a human, so the legal obligations might differ. The user might be responsible for vet bills if the dog was alive, but since it died instantly, maybe not. The cremation and memorial are optional expenses. The owner is asking for these as a request, not necessarily a legal requirement.\n\nEmotional aspect: The user is clearly distressed. They were crying and felt guilty. The owner also was emotional. The user is in a tough financial spot, which is a valid consideration.\n\nEthical question: Should someone be responsible for memorial costs when it's an accident? If the owner had to pay for euthanasia or vet bills, the user might have responsibility. But cremation and a memorial are more about the owner's wishes. Since the user didn't cause the dog to be in the road, and it was a split-second accident, the user might not be ethically obligated to pay those costs.\n\nFinancial situation: The user is a student with a $1k deductible. Adding $150 could be a burden. They might not be able to afford it, especially if it's not a legal requirement.\n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong for refusing. They\u2019ve already apologized and showed empathy. The memorial is a personal choice of the owner. The user isn't at fault for the dog being there, it was an accident. So answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
