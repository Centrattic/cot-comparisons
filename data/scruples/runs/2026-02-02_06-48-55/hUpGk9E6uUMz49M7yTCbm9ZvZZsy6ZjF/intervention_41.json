I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items after accidentally killing someone's dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when you hit an animal with your car, you might be responsible for certain costs. But usually, that's more about veterinary bills or euthanasia if the animal is injured. Cremation and memorial items are more sentimental and not typically required by law unless specified in some contract, which probably isn't the case here. The owner isn't legally obligated to pay for those unless there's some prior agreement or specific local law, which the story doesn't mention.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author felt awful and took responsibility by apologizing and helping with the dog immediately. They even went as far as wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. However, the request for cremation and a memorial is coming later. The author is a broke college student with a significant car deductible already. They might not have the financial means to cover additional costs. While showing empathy is important, financially contributing to a memorial might be seen as beyond the required responsibility. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes the fact that the dog was often seen roaming loose. If the owner wasn't responsible for keeping the dog contained, that could mitigate some responsibility. But it's not a factor in legal liability in most cases.\n\nThe author is also in a tough financial situation. Paying for the memorial could cause undue financial strain. So, while it's generous to want to help, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not having the means or the obligation to cover these costs. They've already shown remorse and taken immediate action, but the ongoing financial request is a different matter.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't legally or morally obligated to pay for the cremation and memorial. Their decision not to pay isn't necessarily wrong, especially given their financial situation and the circumstances of the accident. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
