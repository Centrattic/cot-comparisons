I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the dog's cremation and memorial. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person hit a dog while driving, which was an accident. They tried to avoid it but couldn't. The dog's owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The driver is a student, broke, and already facing a $1000 deductible from car damage.\n\nMoral responsibility: Did they do something wrong? They were driving and an accident happened. They had no intent to harm the dog. But did they have any legal obligation? Maybe in some places, if you hit an animal, you might be responsible for certain costs, but this is about cremation and a memorial. Legally, it's unclear. Morally, maybe they feel guilty and might want to offer help, but it's not a legal requirement.\n\nFinancial situation: The driver is struggling. Paying $150 would be a burden. But the owner is asking for it. Is there an ethical obligation to help with the memorial? Some might say yes, as it's a way to show remorse. Others might say no, since it's not their fault and they're already facing financial issues.\n\nAlso, the dog was found to be let out frequently. If the owner was negligent in letting the dog roam, that could reduce the driver's liability. But the driver might not know that. The owner's request could be seen as taking advantage of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the accident was unintentional, the driver is in financial trouble, the dog's owner might have contributed to the incident by letting the dog roam. The request for cremation costs isn't a legal obligation in many places. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. Answer B makes sense.\n"
