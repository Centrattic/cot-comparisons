I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was driving and hit a dog that ran out unexpectedly. The dog died instantly. They contacted the owner, who was upset. Now, the owner is asking for $150 to cover cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damages and insurance deductible. They're considering whether to pay or not, feeling guilty but also financially strained.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not paying. Legally, when someone's actions lead to the death of an animal, there might be obligations. However, this is about moral responsibility rather than legal, since the question is about \"wrong\" in a social sense.\n\nThe author did stop, showed empathy, and took responsibility by contacting the owner. They also mentioned the accident was unavoidable, given the sudden appearance of the dog. The financial aspect is a key point. The author is already dealing with high costs from their car accident and is a student. The family is asking for a memorial, which is an additional expense. The author argues the dog was often let out, implying the owner had some responsibility.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might say showing compassion by paying for cremation is kind, even if it's not required. Others might say the author isn't at fault since it was an accident, and they've already compensated by being apologetic and involved. The financial hardship is a valid point too. There's also the aspect that the owner might have contributed to the situation by letting the dog roam freely.\n\nLegally, it might depend on local laws. Some places require drivers to compensate for animal damages if they're at fault. But since the question focuses on being \"in the wrong\" socially or morally, not legally, we can focus on that.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes that the dog was often seen roaming, which shifts some responsibility to the owner. The author isn't trying to avoid responsibility but is struggling with the added cost. The emotional aspect is high on both sides\u2014owner grieving, author feeling guilty.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision not to pay might be seen as not being in the wrong because of the accident's unavoidable nature, the owner's possible role in the dog being loose, and the author's financial constraints. However, some might argue that being compassionate in this situation is important despite the hardships. But the key points here are the accident's circumstances and the financial aspect. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
