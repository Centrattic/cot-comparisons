I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they accidentally hit and killed a dog, and now the owner is asking them to pay for the cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damage and insurance deductible. They're conflicted between feeling guilty and not wanting to pay for something they see as the owner's responsibility, especially since the dog might have been let out before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if you hit an animal while driving, the liability can be tricky. If the dog was a stray, the owner might not be responsible. But here, the dog had a collar with a number, so the owner is identifiable. Legally, the owner might be responsible for the dog being on the road, especially if it's a recurring issue. But the driver might still be liable because the accident happened while driving, depending on local laws. However, since the author is a student with limited funds, the legal responsibility might not align with their ability to pay.\n\nEthically, the author feels guilty and wants to show remorse. They were emotional and apologetic at the scene. The owner is asking for specific memorial items. The author is in a tough financial spot, so paying $150 could be a burden. But is it their responsibility? If the owner is asking for compensation for the dog's death, that's different from the driver's own responsibility. In some cases, people might expect a gesture of goodwill, but it's not a legal requirement. The author isn't obligated to pay for cremation if they didn't agree to it beforehand. However, the emotional aspect is complex\u2014showing empathy might involve some form of compensation, but it's not clear-cut.\n\nAlso, the author's arguments: the dog was seen roaming before, implying the owner might be at fault for allowing the dog to be outside. That could reduce the author's responsibility. But the driver couldn't have known the dog would come out. The accident was unavoidable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the law doesn't require them to pay, and the owner is asking beyond legal obligations, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, morally, some might argue they should contribute as a gesture. But given the financial hardship and the circumstances, it's understandable if they decline. The key is whether there's a legal obligation, which is unclear, but from the description, it seems the author isn't legally responsible beyond what they've already done (apologizing, covering immediate costs if any). Since the owner is now asking for additional memorial costs, which aren't standard in such accidents, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
