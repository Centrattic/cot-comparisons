I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person hit a dog with their car, and the owner is asking them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal with your car, there might not be a legal obligation to pay for cremation unless there's a specific law. But the user is asking about moral or social wrong, not just legal. \n\nThe person says it was an accident. They tried to brake, the dog came out of nowhere. They were already dealing with car repairs and a deductible. The owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke student. \n\nOn one hand, showing empathy and offering to help with the memorial could be seen as a kind gesture, even if not legally required. But on the other hand, the accident wasn't their fault, and the owner might be expecting some responsibility. However, the owner also might not have kept the dog contained, as the author mentions seeing the dog roaming before. \n\nI need to think about societal norms. Sometimes people expect compensation for emotional distress, but is that reasonable? If the author is already suffering financially because of their own deductible, is it fair to expect them to pay more? The author feels guilty and is in a hard spot. \n\nThe options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). The key points: accident, no fault, financial hardship, owner's dog was not contained. The family is asking for memorial costs. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because it was an accident, they're in financial trouble, and the dog's owner might be responsible for not containing the dog. The author did offer empathy and showed guilt, but they aren't obligated to pay for the memorial. So the answer is B.\n"
