I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who accidentally killed a dog while driving is in the wrong if they refuse to pay for the cremation and memorial items. The author is asking if they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) in this situation. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about the reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the dog was a pet, the owner might have legal recourse for damages. In some places, hitting a pet might result in liability, but it's not the same as property damage. However, the owner might not be able to claim compensation for the emotional distress or the cost of cremation unless there's a specific law allowing that. The author already tried to apologize and offered sympathy, which is important for moral responsibility, but legal responsibility might be different.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author feels guilty and is a dog lover with three dogs of their own. They were devastated to hit the dog and tried to be helpful by wrapping the body and apologizing. The owner is now asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the car accident, which had a $1k deductible. So, financially, they can't afford this extra expense. \n\nThe author argues it was an accident, the dog was let out before (so maybe the owner is at least partially responsible for not keeping the dog secured), and the accident wasn't preventable. The owner brought the kids and was emotional, which might add to the pressure on the author to feel they should pay. However, the author's own situation is dire. \n\nLegally, the author might not be obligated to pay for the cremation unless the owner can prove negligence beyond the accident. But since it was a sudden appearance of the dog on the road, it's a tough case. The owner might have a claim for the value of the dog, but cremation and memorial items are more about emotional value, which might not be recoverable in court. However, in some places, pet owners might have specific rights or compensation clauses.\n\nMorally, it's a gray area. The author is sympathetic and has shown remorse, which is important. The owner is also in emotional distress. The author's financial situation might make it impossible to pay, but their willingness to show regret is there. The author might not feel it's their fault because the dog was in a dangerous area (cornfield near a country road) and might be allowed to roam, suggesting the owner's responsibility in allowing the dog out. \n\nSo the author's refusal might be justified if there's no legal obligation. The owner might expect compensation, but the author's circumstances are extreme. The key factors are: was the accident preventable? The author tried to stop. The dog's owner's responsibility in letting the dog out. The author's financial hardship. The nature of the requested payment (cremation and memorial vs. medical bills if the dog had survived). \n\nIn terms of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) framework, it's about social judgment. The community might think the author is being inconsiderate if they refuse, especially if the owner is grieving. But if the author has no legal obligation and can't afford it, maybe the community would understand. The author's guilt and their efforts to be empathetic might also influence the judgment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong if there's no legal obligation, but there could be a moral expectation. However, given the author's financial situation and the accident's circumstances, the answer could be B (No, not in the wrong). But if the community expects paying as a sign of responsibility beyond legal, maybe A. But I think the author's situation is more sympathetic, and the owner's request might not be legally enforceable, so the answer would be B.\n"
