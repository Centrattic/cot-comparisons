I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items after accidentally killing a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The person hit the dog by accident while driving. They tried to avoid it, and the dog had a broken neck, so it was an instant death. The owner came, and now they're asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student dealing with their own insurance deductible.\n\nNow, legal responsibility: In many places, if you hit an animal, you might be liable, but it's not always clear. The person didn't intentionally harm the dog. The dog was running into the road, so it's an accident. Legally, maybe they're not obligated to pay for cremation unless there's a law that requires it. But this is more about moral responsibility.\n\nEthically, the person is conflicted. They feel guilty and want to show empathy, but they can't afford it. The owner might expect compensation as a gesture of goodwill. However, the person is in a tough financial situation. The dog was let out before, so maybe the owner is at least partially responsible for the dog being in the road.\n\nSome factors to consider: The accident wasn't the driver's fault, the dog's owner might have contributed by letting the dog roam, the financial hardship of the driver, and the fact that the dog's death was unavoidable. The request for cremation is beyond the immediate costs, which the driver might not be responsible for.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they refuse to pay, they're not legally obligated, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, since the accident wasn't their fault and they're struggling financially, it's reasonable for them to say no without being in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
