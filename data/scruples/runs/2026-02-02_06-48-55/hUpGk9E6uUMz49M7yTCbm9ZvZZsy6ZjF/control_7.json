I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author hit a dog while driving, which resulted in the dog's death. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. They felt terrible, contacted the owner, and the owner came to get the dog. Now the owner is asking the author to pay for cremation and a memorial, totaling $150. The author is a broke college student, already dealing with a car repair deductible of nearly $1,000, and is conflicted about whether they should pay.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit someone's animal, there can be liability. But the situation varies depending on local laws. For example, in some jurisdictions, the owner is responsible for the animal being on the road, especially if it's a free-roaming animal. The author mentions that they've seen the dog roaming before, which might indicate the owner was negligent in letting the dog loose. If the dog was on the road without a leash, the owner might share some blame. So legally, the author might not be obligated to pay for the cremation costs.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical angle. The author is clearly remorseful, showed compassion by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket, and apologized sincerely. They feel guilt but are also financially struggling. Offering to pay for cremation could be a gesture of goodwill, but they also have valid reasons not to, such as their financial situation and the dog's history of roaming. The owner is now asking for a memorial, which might be beyond the initial accident's direct costs. If the owner is requesting memorial items, that's more about sentimental value than necessary expenses, which the author isn't legally bound to cover.\n\nAnother point is the author's own financial hardship. As a student with a low income, adding $150 could be a significant burden. They already have a $1,000 deductible to handle, which is more substantial than the memorial cost. So their decision to prioritize their existing financial responsibilities over the memorial request might be justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that showing empathy through financial contribution, even in their state of being broke, is the right thing to do. But others might say that the owner is asking for more than necessary, especially if the dog was frequently unattended. The author isn't at fault because the dog was on the road unexpectedly, and they couldn't have prevented the accident by any reasonable means.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might not be responsible for the memorial costs if the dog was not properly restrained. Ethically, while they feel guilty, their financial situation and the owner's possible negligence could absolve them of responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay.\n"
