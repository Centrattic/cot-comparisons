I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation and memorial items of the dog they accidentally hit. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the person was driving and hit a dog that suddenly ran out of a cornfield. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog had a broken neck and died instantly. The owner came to get the dog, and now they're asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with their own deductible from the car accident, which is costing them nearly $1000. They feel guilty but are also struggling financially.\n\nSo, the main question is whether they're in the wrong for refusing to pay. Let me think about the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, in many places, if you hit an animal, especially someone else's pet, there might be some responsibility. But does that extend to covering the cremation costs? I'm not sure. Maybe if the dog was on a leash or allowed to roam, the owner could be at fault. The author mentions that the dog had been seen roaming before, which might imply the owner was negligent in letting the dog out. That could affect liability.\n\nEthically, the author is clearly remorseful and upset. They even tried to comfort the owner and kids. They feel guilty and want to help, but their financial situation is dire. The cost of cremation and memorial is $150, which is a significant amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck. But the owner might see this as a way to cope with their loss. Is there an obligation to help with the funeral costs of the pet?\n\nI remember that in some cases, if you cause harm, you might be responsible for veterinary bills if the animal survives, but in this case, the dog died instantly. So maybe there's less legal obligation. However, some places might have laws about compensating the owner for the loss of a pet, especially if it's a family pet. But the author argues that the dog was allowed to roam, which could shift some responsibility to the owner.\n\nFinancially, the author is in a tough spot. They have their own deductible to cover from the car damage. The $150 could make it impossible for them to cover their own expenses. The question is whether empathy and sympathy should require the author to pay despite their own financial struggles.\n\nAnother angle: the author did offer to help emotionally, which is valuable. They expressed genuine remorse. The owner might expect some financial assistance as a gesture of goodwill, but the author isn't legally required to do so. So is it wrong to say no in this case? Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's more about what's fair. If the dog's owner was negligent by letting the dog roam, then the author's responsibility is lessened. The author is also taking the blame for an accident that was beyond their control.\n\nI think the key points are the owner's negligence in letting the dog roam and the author's financial situation. Since the dog was allowed to be on the road, the owner might share responsibility. The author is not in a position to pay extra, and the accident wasn't their fault. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay beyond their means. But they might still choose to contribute what they can if they feel it's right. But legally and ethically, they aren't obligated to pay the full amount. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
