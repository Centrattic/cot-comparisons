I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person was driving on a country road, the dog came out of nowhere, they hit it, the dog died instantly. The owner asked for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the car damage.\n\nLegally, maybe there's something here. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, the owner might be able to claim damages. But the person argues it was an accident, the dog was often seen roaming, and they were already dealing with their deductible.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The person feels guilty and sympathetic, but they also have their own financial struggles. The owner is asking for the cremation, which isn't a legal requirement unless specified. The person isn't responsible for the dog being let off-leash. \n\nThe key points: the dog was not at fault, the accident was unavoidable, the person showed remorse, and the financial burden is significant. Also, the owner might have a legal claim but the person might not be obligated. \n\nIn some states, you might be liable for the animal's value, but cremation costs are beyond that. Since the dog was dead, the owner can choose how to handle the remains unless there's a law requiring it. The person isn't legally required to pay for that, so ethically, it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nThe person is in a tough spot, so refusing isn't necessarily wrong. They aren't at fault beyond the accident itself, which already had consequences. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
