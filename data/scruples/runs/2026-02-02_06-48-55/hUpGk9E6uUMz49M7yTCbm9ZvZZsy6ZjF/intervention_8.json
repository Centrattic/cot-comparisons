I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they accidentally hit and killed a dog while driving, and now the owner is asking them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the car accident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal while driving, especially a pet, there might be some liability. But laws vary. However, the question is about moral or ethical wrong, not legal. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in terms of responsibility and ethics.\n\nThe author tried to avoid the dog, it was an accident, and the dog had a collar with a number. They immediately contacted the owner, showed empathy, and took responsibility. The owner is now asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is struggling because they can't afford it and feel it wasn't their fault entirely since the dog was roaming.\n\nEthically, is the author obligated to pay? Well, if the accident was their fault, some might say they should cover the cremation as part of taking responsibility. But others might argue that the owner should be responsible for their pet's care, like keeping it secure. The author is a student with financial hardship, so expecting them to pay might be unreasonable. Also, the dog was let out before, implying the owner might not have been responsible.\n\nBut then again, causing someone's pet to die is a big deal. Some people believe that if you cause the death, you should help with the burial/cremation. However, the author already showed remorse and is dealing with their own costs. The memorial items are optional, so maybe the core issue is the cremation.\n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong here, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They didn't intentionally harm the dog. The owner could have kept the dog secured. The author is being honest about their financial situation. They might not be morally obligated to pay beyond what they can afford. However, offering to contribute a smaller amount might be considerate, but if they can't afford even that, then they're not in the wrong for refusing. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
