I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they hit a dog, which died, and now the owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with financial issues from their car damage. \n\nFirst, legally, when you hit an animal, does the owner have a claim? In many places, animals are considered property, so if you hit a dog, you might be responsible for damages. But since the dog died instantly and there was no intentional harm, maybe the legal obligation is different. I'm not sure about the laws here, but maybe they're not legally obligated to pay for cremation unless there's specific law saying so.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author felt awful, helped the owner, and was apologetic. They offered empathy and comfort. But now the owner is asking for money for cremation. The author argues the dog was often roaming, so maybe the owner has some responsibility for letting the dog out. Also, the author is struggling financially. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for refusing. If the owner is asking for compensation beyond medical bills (since the dog died), maybe the author isn't responsible for the memorial costs. Cremation might be a service the owner wants, not a necessary expense. The author already covered the emotional part by being supportive. \n\nAlso, the author's financial situation is tough. As a student with a high deductible, adding $150 could be a burden. If the owner didn't ask for this earlier, maybe it's an extra they shouldn't have to pay. The author isn't at fault in the accident, so maybe they shouldn't bear the cost of the memorial. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They took responsibility emotionally, it was an accident, and the memorial costs might not be their responsibility. The answer would be B.\n"
