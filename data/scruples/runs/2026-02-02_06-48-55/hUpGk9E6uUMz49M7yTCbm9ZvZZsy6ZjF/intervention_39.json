I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the dog's cremation and memorial items. \n\nFirst, the situation: the person accidentally hit and killed a dog. They immediately felt guilty and tried to help, even holding the dog and apologizing. The owner came, they had an emotional moment, and now the owner wants compensation for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student with their own deductible from car damage.\n\nSo, legally, maybe? In many places, if you hit an animal, you might not be legally obligated to pay for its cremation unless there's a specific law. The car insurance might cover the car damage but not necessarily the pet's expenses. The owner isn't legally entitled to that, probably. \n\nMorally, it's trickier. The person is remorseful and offered to help initially but now can't afford it. They mention the dog was often seen roaming, which might imply the owner wasn't keeping it secure. That could shift some responsibility. But still, the person is in a tough spot financially. \n\nThe author is conflicted between guilt and financial reality. They're not being malicious, just trying to manage their own situation. The owner's request might be seen as adding financial burden on someone already struggling. \n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They didn't have intent, they're taking responsibility for their car, and the financial request might be unreasonable given their circumstances. Also, if the dog was often loose, the owner might share some responsibility. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
