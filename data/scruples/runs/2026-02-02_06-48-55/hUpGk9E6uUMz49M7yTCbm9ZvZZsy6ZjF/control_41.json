I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hit a dog with their car is wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation and memorial items. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person was driving on a country road and hit a dog that suddenly ran out. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog had a broken neck and died instantly. The owner came, took the dog, and now wants cremation and a memorial costing $150. The person is a broke college student dealing with car repairs from the accident.\n\nLegally, in many places, the driver might be liable for the animal's death if they were at fault. But here, the driver emphasizes it was an accident, and they couldn't have prevented it. Also, they mention that the dog is a rare breed with unique markings and they've seen it roaming before, implying the owner might be negligent in letting the dog out. That could affect liability.\n\nEthically, there's a mix of empathy and practicality. The person is clearly remorseful, showed empathy by being there and comforting the owner and kids. However, they're struggling financially. The cost of cremation is significant for them. But the owner is asking for the cost of handling the dog's remains, which is a common request in such cases. \n\nMoral responsibility is tricky. Even if the owner is at fault for letting the dog out, the driver might feel a moral obligation to help cover the expenses as a gesture of goodwill. However, the driver has their own expenses from the accident and limited funds. \n\nThe key points here are the accident's nature, the driver's genuine remorse, the owner's possible negligence, and the financial burden. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong for not paying. \n\nIn similar situations, people often split. Some believe the driver should cover the costs as it's their fault, even if it's an accident. Others argue that if the owner is at fault for the dog being in the road, the driver shouldn't bear those costs. \n\nGiven that the driver is already handling car repair costs and is a student, refusing to pay might be seen as understandable, especially if there's no legal obligation. But if there's a legal duty to cover the animal's death, they might be wrong. However, since the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, it's unclear. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards the driver not being in the wrong, as the accident was unavoidable and the owner's possible negligence plays a role. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
