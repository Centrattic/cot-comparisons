I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person was driving, and a dog ran out. They couldn't avoid it, the dog died instantly. They tried to help, felt guilty, and even offered an emergency blanket. The owner came, and they were all emotional. Now the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the accident.\n\nSo, the question is about moral responsibility and legal obligation. Legally, in many places, when you hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be liable for veterinary bills if the animal survives. But in this case, the dog died instantly. There might not be legal responsibility for cremation costs unless there's a specific law requiring it. But the user isn't asking about the law, they want to know if the author is in the wrong morally.\n\nThe author is conflicted. They feel guilty but have reasons not to pay: the dog was often seen roaming, they're broke, and it was an accident. On the other hand, the owner is grieving and asking for help with the memorial. \n\nMoral responsibilities can vary. Some might say since the death was caused by the author's actions, even if accidental, they should help with the costs as an act of goodwill. Others might argue that the owner is responsible for the dog's safety by not letting it roam, and the author shouldn't be financially burdened further. \n\nThe author's reasons: the dog was a stray (or allowed to roam), their financial hardship, and it was an accident. The owner's side: they're grieving and want a proper memorial. \n\nI think the answer depends on societal norms. In many cases, people might expect empathy and a gesture from the person responsible, but the amount here is significant for the author. However, the author might not have a legal obligation, so morally, it's a gray area. But if the question is about being in the wrong for saying no, perhaps the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because it's a matter of personal choice and financial constraints. However, others might think showing some support, even a small amount, would be better. The author is already paying for car repairs, which could be seen as sufficient. So, the answer might be B.\n"
