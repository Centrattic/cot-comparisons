I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of an animal they accidentally killed. The situation is that the driver hit a dog, which died instantly. The dog's owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author feels guilty but is broke and argues it wasn't their fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially someone else's pet, you might be liable for damages. However, the legal responsibility can vary. Some states treat pets as property, so you might be responsible for their value, but not necessarily for the owner's emotional costs like cremation. The author's insurance might cover some of this, but the deductible is already high. The owner could potentially sue for the pet's value, but cremation costs might be considered optional and not a necessary expense.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is clearly remorseful. They were upset, helped the family, and are financially struggling. The owner is asking for memorial items, which are more about their emotional closure than necessary expenses. The author might not be legally obligated, but morally, they might feel a duty to contribute. However, given the author's financial situation, is it fair to expect them to pay?\n\nThe author's points: the dog was often seen roaming, their own financial strain, and it being an accident. The dog's owner might have some responsibility if the dog was off-leash in a dangerous area. If the dog was allowed to roam, the owner might share some fault. This could mitigate the author's liability.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if an animal is running at large, the owner's negligence could be a factor. The author might not be fully liable if the dog's owner didn't keep it contained. So legally, maybe the author isn't responsible for the cremation costs. Morally, they might still want to help, but it's not a legal obligation.\n\nThe author is a student, which adds to the financial pressure. The deductible is already a burden. The $150 could be a significant amount for them. The owner's request for the memorial items is above and beyond basic care, which might not be required. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Legally, they might not be responsible for the cremation, and morally, given the circumstances, their decision to say no isn't unjust. The key points are the accident, the dog's roaming behavior, and the author's financial hardship. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
