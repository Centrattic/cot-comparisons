I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of the dog they accidentally killed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and regulations. In some places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be certain responsibilities. But I'm not sure what the laws are exactly. Maybe there's a legal obligation here? If the dog was owned, maybe the owner can claim compensation? But usually, when an animal is killed in an accident, the owner might have to bear the cost unless there's negligence. The author says they were driving, tried to brake, and the dog suddenly came out. That sounds like an accident, not negligence.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author was clearly remorseful, helped the owner, and showed empathy. They even wrapped the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner is now asking for cremation and memorial items. Is there an ethical duty to cover these costs? Some might say yes, as it's a gesture of goodwill, but others might argue it's not their legal responsibility, especially if they didn't do anything wrong. The author is a broke student, so financially strained.\n\nFinancial considerations: The author is already facing a $1k deductible for their car. Adding another $150 might be a huge burden. They mentioned living paycheck to paycheck. The owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. Is that reasonable? Maybe the author isn't legally obligated, but morally, they might feel it's the right thing to do despite the cost.\n\nAlso, the author's guilt is a factor. They feel bad but are trying to balance their own situation. The owner might be in emotional distress too. But the owner could have insurance for their dog, though that's less common for pets unless they have specific coverage.\n\nAnother point: The dog was a rare breed with unique markings, and the author has seen the dog roaming before. That might imply the dog was not properly leashed or supervised. If the dog was off-leash in an area where it's not allowed, the owner might be at fault for letting the dog run loose. That could mitigate the author's responsibility.\n\nSo legally, if the author was following traffic laws and the dog was allowed to be there, maybe the owner can't claim compensation. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author might feel they should help, but their financial situation is dire. The owner might not have considered the author's ability to pay. The author's main responsibility is to handle their own deductible and insurance issues. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't legally in the wrong if the accident was unavoidable. Ethically, while showing remorse is important, they aren't obligated to pay for the cremation and memorial, especially with their financial constraints. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
