I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person hit a dog with their car, and the owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to pay.\n\nFirst, the situation is an accident. They were driving and a dog suddenly ran out. The person tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog had a broken neck and died instantly. The owner got emotional, and the person felt guilty but now is being asked for money. \n\nThe user's arguments: the dog was seen roaming before, they're broke, the accident wasn't preventable. They're a student with financial issues. The owner wants $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is conflicted between guilt and financial hardship.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal, you might not be responsible for the owner's expenses unless there's negligence. Since it was a sudden occurrence and the dog was on the road, the driver might not be at fault. The owner letting the dog roam could be a factor. \n\nEthically, people might have different views. Some might say showing compassion by paying for cremation is good, others might think it's unfair when the person is struggling. The memorial items are optional, so maybe the core issue is the cremation. If the owner is responsible for the dog running off, the financial burden shouldn't be on the driver. \n\nThe author isn't denying responsibility for the accident but argues it's not their fault. They're in a tough financial spot. Considering all factors, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong to refuse.\n"
