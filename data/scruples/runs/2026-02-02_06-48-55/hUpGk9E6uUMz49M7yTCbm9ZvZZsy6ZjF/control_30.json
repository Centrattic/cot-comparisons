I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person accidentally hit and killed someone's dog. They were driving on a country road, and the dog came out of nowhere. The person tried to brake but couldn't avoid the accident. They felt awful, called the owner, and even helped wrap the dog in an emergency blanket. Now, the owner is asking them to pay for cremation and a memorial, which costs $150.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay. Let me think about legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, if you're in an accident, you might be responsible for damages, but pets are usually considered property. However, there's a difference between medical expenses for an injured animal and the cost of disposal. Cremation isn't a medical expense; it's more of a service the owner chooses. So legally, they might not be required to pay for that.\n\nMoral-wise, it's more subjective. The person is clearly remorseful and already upset about the incident. They didn't cause the accident on purpose. The owner's request might be emotional, wanting some form of compensation beyond what insurance covers. But the person is a student, facing financial strain from their car's deductible. They might not have the means to pay extra.\n\nAlso, the dog owner allowed the dog to roam, which could be a factor. If the dog was frequently let out, maybe the owner is somewhat responsible for the situation. However, the driver was on a road near their home, so there might be shared responsibility.\n\nIn similar cases, like hitting a stray animal, people often don't get charged for disposal costs unless there are specific local laws. The author's guilt and empathy are evident, but their financial situation is dire. Refusing to pay the cremation might be seen as morally acceptable if there's no legal obligation. The answer probably hinges on whether there's a legal duty to cover such expenses. Without legal obligation, it's a matter of personal choice and empathy. Since the author is broke and the accident was unavoidable, they're not in the wrong for declining.\n"
