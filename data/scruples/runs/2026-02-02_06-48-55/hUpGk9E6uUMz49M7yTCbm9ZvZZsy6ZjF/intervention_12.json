I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally killed. The author is a broke college student who hit a dog while driving. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid the accident. They offered apologies and help, but now the dog's owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some legal obligation to cover veterinary costs or other expenses. However, since the dog died instantly and there were no medical costs, the owner might be seeking compensation for the cremation and memorial. But legally, is the driver responsible for those costs? It depends on local laws. In some jurisdictions, you might be liable for the animal's value, but not necessarily for the owner's sentimental expenses. If the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, that could also affect liability.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author feels guilty and wants to show remorse, but they're in a tough financial situation. The owner's request for a memorial might be seen as an emotional appeal. However, the author argues that the dog was often let out, implying the owner might be at fault for not keeping the dog contained. That could reduce the author's responsibility.\n\nFinancially, the author is already facing a $1,000 deductible for car repairs, and they're a broke student. They can't afford extra expenses. But should moral responsibility override financial capability? Some might say yes, especially if they can afford a small amount, but if they truly can't, others might see it as unreasonable.\n\nAlso, the author did take steps to show remorse\u2014comforting the family, apologizing, wrapping the dog. The owner's request might be more about closure than financial need. The author's refusal isn't out of malice but necessity. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all factors, the author isn't legally obligated unless local laws say otherwise, and ethically, there's a balance between guilt and financial hardship. The dog's owner's request might be seen as expecting compensation for emotional distress, which isn't always enforceable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing, especially if they can't afford it and the dog's owner had some responsibility in allowing the dog to roam.\n"
