I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user asked whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of an animal they accidentally killed. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The person hit a dog while driving. It was an accident; they tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog's owner came to get the dog, and now they're asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with financial issues from their car damage.\n\nLegally, I think the owner might have a case if there's a law about hitting an animal and being responsible for costs. But in many places, the driver might be liable for veterinary bills if the animal was injured, but since the dog died instantly, maybe the owner is asking for a different kind of compensation. However, cremation is a personal choice, not a medical expense. The owner is requesting something beyond immediate costs, which could be seen as an emotional appeal rather than a legal obligation.\n\nEthically, the person feels guilty and wants to show remorse, but they're also in a tough financial spot. They mention the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, which might reduce their responsibility. The owner's request seems like a way to get more money for sentimental reasons. The author might not be legally obligated to pay, especially if there's no law requiring it. Financial hardship is a factor here.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were in an accident beyond their control, the dog might have been roaming, and the request is for non-essential services. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
