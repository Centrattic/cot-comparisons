I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. The author is a broke college student who already damaged their car and is dealing with insurance. The dog's owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if you accidentally hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be liable for certain costs. However, cremation and memorial items might not be standard in legal liability. The author might not be legally obligated to pay for those extra services, just maybe veterinary bills if the animal was injured and later died. But since the dog died instantly, maybe the owner isn't entitled to those costs. \n\nNext, moral and ethical considerations. The author feels guilty and is already offering apologies and emotional support. They wrapped the dog in an emergency blanket and the owner took it. The author is in a tough financial situation, which might affect their ability to pay. The owner might feel entitled because they lost a pet, but the author didn't intentionally harm the dog. The accident was unavoidable given the circumstances. \n\nThe owner's request includes a memorial, which is more sentimental. Should the person who caused the accident be responsible for that? It's a gray area. Some might argue that showing compassion includes covering some costs, while others might say it's beyond the author's responsibility, especially since it's an accident and they\u2019re struggling financially. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the dog was seen roaming before, implying the owner might have been negligent in letting the dog out. If the dog was frequently let loose, the owner could share some responsibility for the incident. This might reduce the author's liability, both legally and morally. \n\nFinancially, the author is already dealing with a $1k deductible and being a student. Adding $150 could push them further into hardship. The question is whether empathy requires covering this cost despite their own situation. But since it's an accident and not intentional, maybe the author isn't obligated. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often feel they should cover some costs when they cause an accident, but there's no strict rule. The key factors are intent, negligence, and financial capability. The author didn't act negligently; the dog suddenly appeared. So they might not be at fault. \n\nPutting it all together: Legally, maybe not responsible for cremation costs. Morally, it's a tough call. The author is already showing remorse and helping financially with the car damage. The memorial is optional and sentimental. Since the author is broke and the accident wasn't their fault, refusing might be acceptable. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
