I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of that situation is in the wrong. The situation is that they accidentally killed a dog while driving, and now the dog's owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student, already dealing with car damage and insurance costs, and feels it's an accident beyond their control.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal responsibilities. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some liability. But it depends on local laws. The author tried to avoid the dog, so it was an accident. However, some jurisdictions might require you to cover the vet or disposal costs if you're at fault. But since the dog died instantly, maybe there's less liability? Or maybe the owner is within their rights to ask for compensation for the cremation, even if it's optional.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author expressed genuine remorse and even wrapped the dog in an emergency blanket. They felt guilty and offered empathy. But they argue that the dog was often let out, and the accident was unavoidable. The owner might feel entitled to some compensation as an act of respect for their pet. However, the author is in a tough financial situation, so can they be expected to pay?\n\nFinancially, the author is a student with a deductible and living paycheck to paycheck. They might not have the means. But if the owner expects them to pay, is it fair? Maybe the answer hinges on whether there's a legal obligation. If there's no law requiring payment for cremation, then the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. But if there's a legal responsibility, then maybe they are.\n\nAlso, the owner's request for memorial items adds to the cost. Are those reasonable? The author might not be responsible for optional expenses beyond basic disposal. The key here is distinguishing between necessary costs (like proper disposal) and optional memorials.\n\nIn many cases, when someone causes an animal's death, they might be expected to cover immediate costs like vet bills or disposal, but not necessarily sentimental items. Since the dog's owner took the dog home, maybe the disposal is handled by them. The cremation and memorial are more about their emotional needs than necessary expenses. \n\nSo, the author isn't legally obligated in most places to pay for those extra items. Ethically, while showing empathy is good, they can't be blamed for refusing optional, costly memorials, especially given their financial situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
