I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation and memorial of the dog they accidentally killed. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person hit a dog while driving. The dog died instantly, and they were really upset. They tried to break but it was unavoidable. The car got damaged, and they have an insurance claim with a $1k deductible. The owner of the dog asked them to pay $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student and can't afford the deductible plus this expense. They feel guilty but are conflicted about paying.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong for saying no. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be responsible for damages. However, it varies by jurisdiction. The person might not be legally obligated to pay for the cremation and memorial unless there's a law that requires it. Ethically, it's more about what's considered right. The person is already paying for the car repairs via insurance, which includes their deductible. The owner is asking for additional costs for the memorial, which is optional. \n\nThe person mentions that the dog was seen roaming before. If the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, the owner might have some responsibility for not keeping the dog contained. That could affect the ethical responsibility. Also, the person is in financial hardship. If they can't afford it, expecting them to pay for the memorial on top of their deductible might be unreasonable. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of compassion. Even if not legally required, some might argue that paying for the cremation is a gesture of goodwill. However, the memorial items are optional, so the owner could choose a cheaper option. The person is already bearing the cost of the car damage, so maybe the cremation is extra. However, if the dog's owner is now asking for more, it's possible that the person isn't legally responsible for that. \n\nSo, putting it all together: If the person isn't legally obligated, and the dog was allowed to roam, then maybe they aren't in the wrong for not paying. On the other hand, if there's an expectation of responsibility beyond the car damage, they might be seen as inconsiderate. But considering their financial situation and the fact that it was an accident, the answer might be that they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
