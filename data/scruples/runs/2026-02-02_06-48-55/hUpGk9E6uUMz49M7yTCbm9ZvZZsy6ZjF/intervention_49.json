I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to consider all the points.\n\nFirst, the accident happened. The person was driving, and a dog ran out unexpectedly. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog died instantly, and they were really upset about it. They contacted the owner, showed empathy, and wrapped the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner later asked for $150 to cover cremation and a memorial.\n\nThe author is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the car damage. They feel guilty but also think the dog might have been a stray or allowed to roam, implying maybe the owner was negligent. They're conflicted between wanting to be compassionate and their financial constraints.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to pay. Let's break down the legal and ethical aspects.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal while driving, you might be liable. However, laws vary. Some places require you to cover veterinary costs if the animal is injured, but if it's killed, maybe not. The author might not have legal obligation, but that's not the only factor here.\n\nEthically, the author took responsibility by contacting the owner and expressing remorse. The owner is now asking for more. The author's reasoning includes the dog possibly being a stray (so the owner might not have been keeping it secure), their own financial hardship, and it was an accident beyond their control. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is grieving and might see the request as a way to memorialize their pet. The author might feel pressured to help, but their personal circumstances are dire. \n\nThe author's guilt is real, but they also argue that the accident wasn't preventable. The ethical dilemma is about balancing empathy for the owner's loss with the author's own financial reality. If there's no legal requirement, the moral responsibility becomes subjective. \n\nConsidering all points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They already showed compassion and took action. Refusing to pay the cremation might be seen as cruel, but given the circumstances (financial hardship and possible owner negligence), it's understandable. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the accident was unavoidable, and the author is making a personal decision based on their situation.\n"
