I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of an animal they accidentally killed. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author hit a dog while driving, which resulted in the dog's death. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid the accident. The dog had a collar with a contact number, so they called the owner. The owner came, took the dog, and now wants the author to cover the cremation and memorial costs totaling $150.\n\nThe author is a broke college student dealing with a car insurance deductible of nearly $1,000. They argue that the dog was a rare breed they've seen roaming before, so maybe the owner didn't keep it contained. The accident was unavoidable, and they feel guilty but also financially strained.\n\nLegally, in many places, drivers might be held responsible for damages if they caused an animal's death. However, the specifics depend on local laws. Ethically, the author feels guilty and wants to show remorse but can't afford it. They might think it's unfair if the owner didn't contain the dog properly. The owner, on the other hand, is asking for compensation for the cremation and memorial. \n\nThe key points here are intent and responsibility. The author didn't intentionally harm the dog; it was an accident. They did try to brake and were apologetic. However, depending on the jurisdiction, the owner might have a claim for compensation. The author's financial situation is also a factor. \n\nBut the question isn't about ethics or law\u2014it's whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a judgment based on the scenario provided. The author didn't act with malice. They were in a split-second situation. The owner's request might be seen as reasonable in some contexts, but the author's refusal could be justified if there's no legal obligation. \n\nConsidering the author's guilt and willingness to feel remorse but inability to pay, and the owner's responsibility to contain their dog, there's a balance. Legally, maybe the author is responsible, but ethically, it's a gray area. Since the answer is A or B, and the user wants a judgment, the author is likely not in the wrong because the accident was unavoidable and there's no indication of negligence beyond the car accident. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
