I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of an animal they accidentally killed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hit a dog that was in a cornfield, which suddenly ran into the road. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid hitting it. The dog died instantly. The owner later asked for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with a car repair.\n\nLegally, when you hit an animal, responsibility can vary. In some places, you might be liable for vet bills or disposal costs if the animal is injured or killed. But cremation and memorial items might be considered optional, not necessary expenses. The owner let the dog roam, which could be a factor in their responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly distressed. They felt guilty and even comforted the family. They're struggling financially, and the deductible is already a burden. The request for extra costs might be seen as unreasonable, especially if the dog was often let out.\n\nEthically, while the author is remorseful, the family's request adds financial strain. The author isn't at fault for the dog being in the road. They already apologized and took responsibility for the accident. Paying for cremation isn't a legal obligation unless specified by law. Since the dog was outside the home, the owner's responsibility to contain the animal might also be a point.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to be compassionate, and the financial request is an added burden. The answer is likely B.\n"
