I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation and memorial of the dog they accidentally hit. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person hit a dog while driving, which was an accident. The dog was on a country road, and the person had already taken responsibility, expressed remorse, and even helped wrap the dog. The owner is now asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student dealing with their own insurance deductible of $1000.\n\nNow, the question is about moral wrongdoing. Legally, in most places, the driver might be liable for the dog's death if they were at fault. However, the driver here didn't do anything illegal\u2014they were on a country road, the dog came out suddenly, and the accident was unavoidable. So legally, maybe they aren't required to pay for cremation. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nThe person did offer to pay, but now they're conflicted. They have financial issues, and the dog might have been a stray or allowed to roam. The owner could be at fault for letting the dog run loose. The person already apologized and showed empathy. The request for a memorial is beyond just the cremation, which might be seen as an additional expense. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the driver caused the accident, if they weren't negligent (e.g., not speeding, not under the influence), they might not be morally obligated beyond immediate assistance. The owner's request for a memorial is optional, so the driver isn't legally or necessarily morally bound to cover that. The person's financial situation and the owner's possible role in the dog being on the road are mitigating factors.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), since it was an accident, they took responsibility, and the additional costs are optional. However, some might argue that showing generosity is the right thing to do, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's generous.\n"
