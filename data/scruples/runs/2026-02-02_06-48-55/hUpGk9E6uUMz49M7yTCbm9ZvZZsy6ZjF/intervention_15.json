I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person hit a dog while driving and now the owner is asking for cremation costs. They're a broke college student with their own deductible to handle.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. If they hit the dog, depending on the state, they might be liable for vet bills or other expenses. But since the dog died instantly, maybe the owner isn't legally required to pay for cremation. Some states might consider the owner's responsibility if the dog was off-leash. The author mentions the dog was in a cornfield near the road and had unique markings, implying it was often loose. That could affect liability.\n\nMoral aspect: The person is clearly upset and offered help, but now the owner is asking for money. They're in a tough financial spot. The author might feel guilty but not necessarily responsible for extra memorial costs beyond what's legally required. The request for a paw print and vase seems optional, not necessary for the dog's care. So maybe the author isn't wrong to refuse those extras.\n\nFinancial situation: The author is a student with a $1k deductible. Tossing in $150 for optional items might be too much. They might not have the means, and it's not clear if the owner is justified in expecting payment for those items beyond the basic cremation.\n\nAlso, the accident was unavoidable. The dog ran out suddenly. Driver couldn't have prevented it. So legally, maybe no fault. The owner's request might be emotional but not legally enforceable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong to refuse. Answer B.\n"
