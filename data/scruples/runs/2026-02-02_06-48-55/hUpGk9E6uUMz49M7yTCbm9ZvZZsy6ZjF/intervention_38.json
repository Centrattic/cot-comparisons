I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hit a dog with their car, leading to the dog's death. The owner now wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The user is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the accident.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In some places, you might be liable for damages if you cause an animal's death through negligence. But the user says they tried to brake and it was a sudden accident. So maybe they aren't legally obligated to pay for cremation beyond what's required by law. But that's not the main question here. The question is about moral wrong.\n\nMorally, the user is conflicted. They feel guilty but have valid reasons: financial hardship, the dog was seen roaming before, and it was an accident. The owner is asking for memorial expenses, which might be seen as optional. The user didn't cause the dog to be on the road, so expecting them to pay for memorials could be a stretch. However, the user did cause the death, so there's a sense of responsibility there. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a tough spot financially. The deductible is $1k, and they're a student. If the memorial is optional, they aren't legally required to pay, and morally, they might not be at fault for the owner's choice to spend money on a memorial. The fact that the dog was let out before could also be a point in the user's favor, as the owner had a role in the dog being in danger.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the author refuses, considering the circumstances, their financial situation, and the fact that the memorial items are optional, it might not be wrong. They aren't avoiding responsibility for the accident, but they can't afford more expenses. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
