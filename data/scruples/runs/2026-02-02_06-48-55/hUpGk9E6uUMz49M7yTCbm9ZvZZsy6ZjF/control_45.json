I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they hit. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author was driving and hit a dog that ran onto the road. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid the accident. The dog died instantly, and the owner came to get it. Now, the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with their own car damages and deductible, so they're struggling financially.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to pay. Let me think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, if you hit an animal, you might be responsible for vet bills or damages if the animal was injured. But since the dog died instantly, maybe there's no legal obligation for cremation costs. However, this varies by jurisdiction. The author might need to check local laws.\n\nEthically, there's the aspect of empathy and taking responsibility. The author feels guilty and apologized, but they argue the dog was often let loose. That could be a point in their favor. However, the owner is asking for memorial costs, which might not be a legal requirement but could be a gesture of goodwill. The author is struggling financially, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they already wrapped the dog and the owner took it. Cremation is now an added expense. The author might not have an obligation to cover that, but some might argue that showing compassion is important. However, given the author's financial situation, it's a tough spot.\n\nI need to consider if there's a duty to pay. If there's no legal obligation and the accident was unavoidable, then refusing might not be wrong. The author isn't at fault beyond the accident itself. But some might say that taking responsibility includes covering all costs, even memorial items. However, the memorial is optional and the owner is adding that as a request.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were not at fault for the accident, and the request for cremation and memorial isn't legally required. Their financial situation is also a factor. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
