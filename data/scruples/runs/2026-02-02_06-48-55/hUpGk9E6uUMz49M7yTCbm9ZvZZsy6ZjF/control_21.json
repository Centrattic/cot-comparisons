I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person hit a dog while driving. The dog died instantly. The owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with a car repair deductible. They feel guilty but are conflicted about paying.\n\nLegal perspective: In some places, drivers might be liable for damages if they hit an animal, especially if it's a pet. But since the dog was on the road and possibly a stray, the liability could be less. However, the author did contact the owner, showed remorse, and there's a possibility that the owner might not have a legal claim if the dog was running loose.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author is struggling financially and already taking responsibility by showing guilt. They might not have the means to pay. The owner is asking for specific memorial items, which could be seen as optional. The author isn't being cruel, just trying to manage their own situation.\n\nEthically, while it's a tragedy, the accident was unavoidable. The author isn't at fault in terms of negligence, just an unexpected event. The owner's request might be emotional, but the author's refusal isn't cruel if they can't afford it. They already provided emotional support and took responsibility by apologizing.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're in a tough spot and not being asked for something they can't handle. Answer B.\n"
