I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they hit. The situation is that the author accidentally killed someone's dog while driving, and now the owner wants them to cover the cremation and memorial costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there might be some liability. However, usually, the owner is responsible for the care and any subsequent costs unless there's negligence on the driver's part. The author mentioned they were driving on a country road and the dog suddenly appeared. They tried to brake, so it seems like a genuine accident. If the dog was off-leash and roaming, maybe the owner is at least partially responsible for letting the dog out where it could be hit by a car.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is clearly upset and feels a lot of guilt. They even helped the owner by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket and offered condolences. But the author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damage and insurance deductible. The cost of cremation and the memorial is $150, which is a significant amount for them. They might not have the means to pay, especially with their current financial situation.\n\nThe owner's request might be seen as adding more financial burden on someone who's already suffering. However, some people might argue that showing empathy and taking responsibility includes helping with these costs. But since the accident was unavoidable and the dog was off-leash, maybe the author isn't obligated. Also, the owner brought the kids, which is understandable in a traumatic situation, but the request for specific memorial items might be seen as a way to get more money.\n\nLegally, unless there's a law in that state requiring drivers to pay for the disposal of an animal they hit, the author isn't necessarily at fault. Morally, it's a gray area. The author feels guilty and wants to show regret, but their financial situation is dire. They might not be in the wrong for refusing if there's no legal obligation. The owner could be expected to handle the costs since they're responsible for the dog's welfare and its disposal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it was an accident, the dog was on the road, and there's no legal requirement to pay for cremation. Plus, the author's financial hardship is real.\n"
