I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of an animal they accidentally killed. The situation is that they hit a dog with their car, which was an accident. The dog's owner wants them to cover the cremation and memorial costs, totaling $150. The author is a broke student, their car is damaged, and they have a $1k deductible. They feel guilty but also think the dog was often let out, so maybe it's not entirely their fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in some places, drivers might be responsible for damages if they caused an animal's death, but it depends on local laws. Since the dog was a pet, the owner might have a claim. However, the author was driving and it was an accident. The owner's request is for cremation and memorial items, which aren't necessarily medical expenses. Legally, maybe the owner can't make them pay unless there's a law requiring it.\n\nMorally, the author is conflicted. They felt awful and took responsibility by contacting the owner. The owner is asking for money for memorial items, which are more about sentimental value than necessary costs. The author is struggling financially. If they can afford to help, maybe they should, but if they can't, it's understandable to say no. The fact that the dog was often seen loose might reduce the author's liability, as the owner might be partly at fault for not keeping the dog contained.\n\nThe author's reasons: the dog was seen roaming before, financial hardship, and it was an accident. These points support that it's not their fault entirely. They already took responsibility by apologizing and wrapping the dog. The request seems to be for emotional support items, which the author isn't obligated to pay for unless there's a prior agreement. So, morally, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing, especially given their circumstances. They aren't trying to avoid responsibility but are struggling financially. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
