I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not paying for the dog's cremation and memorial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person hit a dog that ran into the road, causing it to die. The dog had a collar with a contact number, so they called the owner. The owner came, and now they're asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student with their own car damage costs and deductible.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong for refusing to pay. Let me think about legal and ethical angles. Legally, in many places, if you hit an animal (especially a pet), there might not be a legal obligation to cover the owner's expenses beyond maybe the cost of the animal itself. However, the owner is asking for cremation and a memorial, which are additional costs. Those might not be legally required.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The person expressed genuine remorse, comforted the owner and kids, and took responsibility by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. They were also in a financial bind themselves. The owner might feel entitled to these costs because of the emotional loss, but the person in the story is struggling financially. Also, the dog was a stray? Wait, the person mentions they've seen the dog roaming before. So maybe the owner wasn't keeping the dog securely. If the dog was off-leash in a rural area near a road, that could be a factor. Some places have leash laws; if the owner didn't follow them, they might share some responsibility.\n\nFinancially, the person is a student with a $1k deductible and already in a tough spot. Asking for $150 might be reasonable for them, but given their situation, it's a significant amount. They might feel it's unfair since it was an accident and the owner's own fault for letting the dog roam.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, probably not obligated. Ethically, it's a gray area. The person showed empathy but can't afford it. The owner's request might be more about emotional support than compensation. The writer isn't in the wrong for refusing, especially considering their financial state and the dog's possible lack of secure containment. So answer B.\n"
