I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items of an animal they accidentally killed. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person hit a dog with their car, which was an accident. The dog's owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student, already dealing with car repair costs and a high deductible. They feel guilty but also not at fault because the dog was running into the road, and the owner might have let the dog out before.\n\nSo, the key points here are: accident, guilt, financial responsibility, and legal obligations. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, if the person hit the dog while driving, depending on the location, there might be laws about liability for animals. If the dog was off-leash in an area where it's allowed, maybe the owner is at least partially responsible. However, in many jurisdictions, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be liable for certain expenses, but it's not always clear-cut. The author might not be legally required to pay for cremation unless it's part of a settlement or law. \n\nEmotionally, the author is conflicted. They feel guilty and want to show empathy, but they can't afford it. The owner might be in emotional distress and expecting some form of compensation for the loss, which is understandable. However, the author's financial situation is dire, and they might not have the means. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. While the author isn't at fault in the sense that it was an accident and the dog was let out, there's a moral consideration about helping the grieving owner. But if there's no legal obligation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for refusing, especially given their own financial struggles. \n\nAlso, the fact that the dog was seen roaming before suggests the owner might have been negligent in keeping it contained, which could shift some responsibility away from the author. However, that's a sensitive point because it's not the author's fault the dog was there. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there's a legal obligation to pay for the cremation. If there's no legal requirement, then the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. But if there's a local law where they can be held liable for the dog's disposal, it might be different. The question is more about moral responsibility rather than legal. Since the author is already handling their own damages and the situation was an accident, they might not be morally at fault for not paying additional costs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if there's no legal obligation and considering the context of the accident and their financial situation.\n"
