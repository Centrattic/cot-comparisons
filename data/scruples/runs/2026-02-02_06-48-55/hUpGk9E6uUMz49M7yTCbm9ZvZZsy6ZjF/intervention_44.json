I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items of a dog they accidentally killed. The author is a broke college student who already has insurance issues and a deductible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when someone causes an animal's death due to a car accident, they might be responsible for certain costs. But cremation and memorial items are more about the owner's emotional needs. Legally, maybe not required unless there's a specific law, but ethically?\n\nEthically, the author feels guilty and wants to show remorse. They did offer to help by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket and being empathetic. But the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author's financial situation is dire, so they can't afford this on top of their car deductible.\n\nThe author argues that the dog was often seen roaming, implying the owner might have been negligent in not keeping the dog secure. That could shift some responsibility. If the dog was off-leash in an area where that's not allowed, maybe the owner shares blame.\n\nBut the author did contact the owner immediately, expressed regret, and tried to be compassionate. They're not trying to avoid responsibility but are in a tough spot financially. Also, the accident was truly unforeseeable\u2014the dog came out of nowhere. The author had no intent or negligence beyond the accident itself.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might say the author should contribute if they can, but given their financial situation, it's a heavy burden. Others might argue that the owner should cover these costs as part of pet ownership, especially if the dog was frequently loose.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the law doesn't require it, and the author's refusal is due to financial inability and the dog owner's possible negligence, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if society expects covering all related costs regardless, then maybe they are. However, considering the circumstances, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
