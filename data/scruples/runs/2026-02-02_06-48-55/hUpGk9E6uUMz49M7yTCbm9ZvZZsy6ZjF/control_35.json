I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit and killed. The situation is that they were driving, the dog ran out, they hit it, and now the owner wants them to cover the cremation and memorial costs. The author is a broke college student with their own car damage costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you hit an animal while driving, especially a pet, there might be some liability. But usually, the owner is responsible for their pet's safety. If the dog was off-leash in a dangerous area, the owner might be at fault. However, laws vary, so maybe the author could be held responsible for damages, but maybe not for the cremation costs specifically unless there's a law that says so.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author seems genuinely remorseful and was emotional about the incident. They tried to do the right thing by contacting the owner and expressing sympathy. The owner is now asking for money for cremation and a memorial. But the author is struggling financially. Is it fair to expect them to cover those costs? The owner could have considered that the author might not have the means, especially if the accident was unavoidable. The author also has their own expenses from the car damage.\n\nThe author argues that the dog was often seen roaming, implying the owner might not have kept it secure. That could shift some responsibility to the owner for the incident. If the dog was frequently let out in areas where cars pass, the owner might be partly at fault. \n\nAlso, the cost of cremation and memorial seems like an emotional request. While the owner is grieving, the author is in a financial tight spot. The author might not be legally obligated to pay for those services unless there's a specific agreement or law. The author's guilt is real, but they might not have the means to cover additional costs beyond what's necessary. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted responsibly by contacting the owner and showing empathy. The financial burden and the fact that the accident was unavoidable, possibly due to the dog's roaming habits, suggest that the author isn't at fault. Therefore, refusing to pay for the memorial items might be understandable, especially given their financial situation. The answer would be B (No).\n"
