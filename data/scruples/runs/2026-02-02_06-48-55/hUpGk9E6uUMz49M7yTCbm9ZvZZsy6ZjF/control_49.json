I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was driving and hit a dog that ran out of a cornfield. The dog died instantly. The owner came, they were all emotional. Now the owner wants the author to pay for cremation and a memorial. The author is broke, dealing with car damage, and thinks the dog might be a stray since they've seen it before.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to say no. \n\nLegally, in many places, if you hit an animal, the owner might have a claim for damages. But if the dog was a stray or allowed to roam, that could affect liability. The author mentions the dog had a collar but was seen before, possibly off-leash. So maybe the owner isn't entirely blameless. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author feels guilty and wants to show remorse, but they can't afford it. If the dog was a family pet, the cost of cremation is part of the loss. But if the dog was often roaming, maybe the owner isn't holding the author fully responsible. \n\nFinancial situation matters. The author is a broke student with their own deductible. They might not have the means. But does that excuse not paying anything? Maybe not, but they can offer something if they can. \n\nAlso, the author did show empathy, helped immediately, and apologized. The owner might be looking for closure, but the author's ability to pay is limited. \n\nSo, the answer depends on both legal and ethical aspects. Legally, maybe the author isn't liable if the dog was a stray. Ethically, it's a gray area, but the author's circumstances are tough. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author wasn't at fault in terms of the accident, the dog's roaming might mean the owner shares some responsibility, and the author's financial situation is a factor. They aren't in the wrong for not paying beyond what they can afford, but maybe offering a small amount could help.\n"
