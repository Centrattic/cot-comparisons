I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial items for the dog they accidentally killed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author hit the dog by accident while driving, and the dog died instantly. They felt guilty, tried to help, and even went as far as wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket. The owner then asked for $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car damage and insurance deductible.\n\nLegally, I think in many places, drivers might not be liable for the animal's cremation costs unless there's a specific law requiring it. But legally, maybe the owner is out of luck unless the dog was a service animal or something. But the question is more about moral or social wrongness, not legal.\n\nMorally, the author did feel remorse and tried to help. They were already paying for their car repairs. The dog's owner is asking for additional costs. The author is in a financial struggle. Is it fair to expect them to pay for the cremation? On one hand, the owner might feel that the person responsible should cover all costs. On the other hand, it was an accident, and the author is already suffering financial loss from the car damage. \n\nThe author mentions that the dog was seen roaming before, which might imply the owner wasn't keeping the dog contained. If the dog was off-leash in a rural area, maybe the owner is also at fault for allowing the dog to be in a dangerous place. That could shift some responsibility away from the driver. \n\nThe author is conflicted between wanting to show empathy and their own financial situation. They're not avoiding responsibility for the car damage, which they're handling through insurance. But the cremation is an extra expense. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, sometimes people do expect the person who caused the death to cover the cremation. But if the person is in a financial bind and it's an accident, others might be more understanding. The owner's request might be seen as an additional emotional pressure, especially if the author is already dealing with guilt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they refuse to pay, are they being selfish, or is it reasonable given their circumstances? The author isn't denying responsibility for the accident, just the additional costs. Since the dog's death was accidental and the author is already paying through their insurance deductible, maybe they aren't morally obligated to pay more. Especially if the owner didn't contain the dog properly. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong. They handled the situation with empathy, and the additional costs are a stretch when they're already facing financial loss. Plus, the dog's owner might share some responsibility for letting the dog roam freely.\n"
