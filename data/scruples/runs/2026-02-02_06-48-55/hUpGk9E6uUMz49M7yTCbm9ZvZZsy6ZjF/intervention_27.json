I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation of the dog they accidentally hit. The situation is that the author hit a dog, the dog died, and now the owner is asking for cremation costs and a memorial. The author is a broke college student with a $1k deductible for their car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In most places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, there's usually no legal requirement to cover the owner's out-of-pocket expenses beyond maybe the vet bills if the animal survives. Since the dog died instantly, the owner might not have vet costs, so the cremation and memorial are optional. Legally, the author probably isn't obligated to pay for those.\n\nNext, moral responsibility. The author feels guilty and was very emotional about the incident. They went out of their way to apologize and comfort the owner and her kids. However, the owner is now asking for money for the cremation and memorial. Since it was an accident and the dog was likely a stray (the author mentions seeing the dog roaming before), there's a question of whether the owner should be expected to cover these costs. The author isn't at fault in the sense that they couldn't have avoided the accident, so maybe they aren't morally required to pay beyond what they've already done.\n\nFinancial situation is a big factor here. The author is a broke student with a $1k deductible for their car. Adding $150 for cremation might be a significant burden. If they can afford to pay, maybe they should do it as a gesture of goodwill, but since they can't, maybe it's understandable to refuse. However, if they can afford a small amount, even $50, donating that might help ease guilt without breaking them.\n\nThe owner's request for a memorial might be emotional. They want to honor their pet, and the author's contribution could be symbolic. But since the author isn't responsible in a legal or strict moral sense, they might not owe that money. The author's guilt is real, and they might choose to pay if possible, but it's not a right or wrong issue if they can't.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing because the request isn't legally required, and the circumstances (financial hardship, accident) mitigate moral responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
