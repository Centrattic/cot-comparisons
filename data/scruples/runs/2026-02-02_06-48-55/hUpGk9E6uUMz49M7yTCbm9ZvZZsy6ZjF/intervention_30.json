I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the dog's cremation and memorial items. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author hit a dog with their car, which resulted in the dog's death. They tried to stop but couldn't. The dog had a collar with a number, so they called the owner, who came and took the dog. Now the owner is asking the author to cover the cremation and memorial costs totaling $150. The author is broke, a student, and already dealing with car repair costs. They feel guilty but are conflicted about paying.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, if you cause an animal's death through negligence or accident, you might be responsible for certain costs. However, this varies by jurisdiction. The author might not have legal obligation unless there's a law requiring it. Ethically, it's different. The owner might expect compensation as a gesture of goodwill, even if not legally required. The author's guilt and empathy could play a role here.\n\nThe author mentions the dog was often seen roaming, which could imply the owner was negligent in not keeping the dog contained. If the dog was off-leash in an area where that's allowed, the owner might share some responsibility. But if the area is a no-leash zone, maybe the owner is at fault.\n\nFinancially, the author is struggling. They have a $1k deductible for car repairs and are a student. Paying $150 could be a burden. However, the author could argue that they already showed remorse by apologizing and helping, so additional costs might be unreasonable.\n\nI should also consider the emotional toll. Both parties are upset. The author is guilty, the owner is grieving. The request for a memorial might be about closure more than money. But is it fair to expect the person who caused the accident to pay for that closure?\n\nIn some cases, people might feel that a small gesture is appropriate, even if not legally required. But the author's situation is dire. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a smaller donation or helping in another way. However, the owner asked for specific items totaling $150, which the author can't afford.\n\nSo, legally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong if there's no law requiring payment. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't malicious, it was an accident, and the owner's dog was possibly allowed to roam. The author's financial hardship is a significant factor. The key points are intent, responsibility, and capacity to pay. Since the author didn't act recklessly and is struggling, refusing payment might not be morally wrong. However, there's a case for showing empathy despite the circumstances. But given the facts, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
