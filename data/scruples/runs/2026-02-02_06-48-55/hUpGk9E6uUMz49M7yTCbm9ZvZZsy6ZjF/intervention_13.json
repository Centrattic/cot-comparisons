I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to pay for the cremation and memorial of a dog they accidentally killed. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer hit a dog while driving. The dog's neck was broken, and it was an accident. They tried to brake but couldn't avoid the collision. The dog had a collar with a number, so they called the owner, who came with kids, and the writer felt guilty, apologized, and gave the dog an emergency blanket. Now the owner is asking for $150 for cremation and some memorial items. The writer is a broke college student dealing with a car insurance deductible of $1k.\n\nI need to analyze this from a moral and legal standpoint. Legally, in many places, if a driver hits an animal, especially a pet, they might be liable for damages. Cremation costs could be part of that. But the writer is a student with financial issues. However, the owner is asking for cremation, which is a service, and maybe the law requires that. But the writer is conflicted because they don't think it's their fault, the dog was running loose, and they're already paying for their car damage.\n\nMoral perspective: The writer feels guilty and has shown empathy by apologizing and comforting the family. They might feel that the owner is taking advantage of their guilt. The owner's request is understandable emotionally, but the writer can't afford it. The question is whether refusing is wrong.\n\nFrom the scenario, the writer did their part by calling the owner, apologizing, and wrapping the dog. The owner is now seeking compensation for the cremation. Legally, there might be obligations, but morally, the writer is already covering their car costs. The owner might be asking for more than just the immediate costs. The writer's situation is dire financially, so even a small amount like $150 could be a strain. \n\nThe key points here are: it was an accident, the dog was likely allowed to roam (so the owner might be partly responsible), the writer is already dealing with their own damages, and the financial situation is tough. \n\nIn similar cases, sometimes people are expected to contribute to the pet's expenses, but if the pet was off-leash or not properly contained, the owner might share some responsibility. The writer's guilt is evident, but they have to consider their own financial well-being. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the law says they must pay, then maybe. But the question is more about moral wrong, not legal. The writer has apologized and expressed remorse. The owner's request is for an optional memorial, which might not be a legal requirement. The writer's financial situation is a factor here. They might not be in the wrong for refusing, especially if the dog was allowed to be in dangerous areas. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure. Legal liability could be a gray area, but the question is about being in the wrong in a general sense. Since it was an accident and the dog's owner might be at fault for letting it roam, the writer's refusal could be understandable, even if it's not the most generous option. So, B seems correct.\n"
