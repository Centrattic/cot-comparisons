I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying for the cremation of a dog they accidentally hit and killed while driving. The situation is that they were driving on a country road, a dog ran out, they couldn't stop in time. The dog died instantly. They tried to brake, it was an accident. The owner wants them to pay for cremation and a memorial, which is $150. The person is a broke college student, has their own car damages to deal with, and is financially struggling.\n\nSo the main points here: Was it an accident? Yes, they tried to brake, the dog came out suddenly. The person felt guilty, offered sympathy, but now is being asked for more money. The owner might feel entitled to compensation, but legally, in many places, if it's an accident and the driver wasn't reckless, they might not be liable for cremation costs. Usually, liability covers vet bills or treatment, but if the animal died instantly, maybe not. Also, the person is already dealing with their own car insurance deductible. \n\nThe person is conflicted because they feel guilty but also think the dog might have been a stray or let out often. However, even if the dog was a stray, the owner is the one who called them. So maybe the owner is expecting compensation. But morally, should the person have to pay? It's a gray area. The person is broke, so maybe they can't afford it. But if they have insurance, maybe the insurance would cover some of that? Or maybe not, because it's animal damage. \n\nIn terms of wrongness, if they were not at fault (like speeding, drunk driving, etc.), then they might not be responsible beyond what's legally required. Since the dog was hit in an accident, and there's no indication of negligence, the person might not be in the wrong to refuse. However, some might argue that showing compassion by paying for the cremation, even if not legally required, is the right thing. But given their financial situation, it's a tough spot. \n\nSo legally, maybe they aren't obligated. Morally, it's debatable. The question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" If being in the wrong means legally liable or morally blameworthy, then the answer could be B (No), because it was an accident and they showed remorse. But if the community expects them to cover the costs as a matter of kindness, then maybe they are in the wrong for not offering. But the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for A or B, and based on the information given, it's more about whether they are at fault. Since it was an accident, and there's no indication of negligence, and they already showed empathy, the answer would be B (No).\n"
