I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person had an accident where they hit a dog, which died. The dog had a collar with a number, so they contacted the owner. The owner is asking them to pay for cremation and a memorial. The person is a broke college student with their own financial issues from the car damage.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In many places, if you hit an animal, especially a pet, you might be liable. But laws vary. If the dog was loose, maybe the owner is partially responsible for not keeping it contained. However, the driver might still be liable if they were at fault. But the accident was sudden and unavoidable, so maybe it's a shared responsibility or the driver isn't fully at fault.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The person is clearly remorseful and offered sympathy. They're in financial trouble themselves. The owner is asking for money for cremation, which is a service, and a memorial. The person might feel it's an emotional request rather than a necessity. On the other hand, the owner is grieving and might need the closure that cremation provides. However, the person isn't obligated to pay if there's no legal requirement. The owner could be asking for compensation beyond what's legally required, especially for the memorial items, which are optional.\n\nFinancial hardship is a factor. If the person can't afford it, forcing them to pay could be unfair. The owner might not consider the driver's situation. But if the driver can afford a small amount, maybe they should contribute something as a gesture of goodwill. However, the driver is a student with a high deductible, so $150 is a significant burden.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the dog being seen roaming before. If the owner allowed the dog to roam freely, they might be at fault for not securing the pet. That could reduce the driver's liability. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if not legally required, some might argue that the person should help because it's the compassionate thing to do. Others might say that since it was an accident and the owner was negligent in letting the dog out, the driver isn't responsible for the memorial costs.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had an accident, are remorseful, and have financial constraints. The owner's request might be excessive, especially for non-essential items. The author isn't legally obligated if the owner was negligent. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
