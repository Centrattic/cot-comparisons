I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who asked the question is in the wrong for not paying for the cremation of a dog they accidentally killed. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person hit a dog while driving, which was an accident. The dog died instantly, and they felt guilty, even comforting the owner and her kids. Now, the owner is asking them to pay $150 for cremation and a memorial. The author is a broke college student dealing with their own car repairs and deductible.\n\nSo, the main question is whether they should feel obligated to pay. Legally, in many places, drivers might be responsible for damages if they caused an accident, but animals aren't considered property in the same way. However, there's no legal requirement to cover things like cremation unless there's a specific law. \n\nEthically, it's more complex. The person was sorry and showed empathy. They might feel responsible for the immediate costs, like vet bills if the dog survived, but the dog died instantly. The owner's request is for memorial expenses, which are emotional rather than necessary. The author is in a financial bind, which is a valid reason to say no. \n\nAlso, the dog was let out before, which the author saw. That might imply the owner wasn't fully responsible, but that's not an excuse. The person still caused the accident. However, since it was an accident and unavoidable, maybe they aren't at fault beyond the immediate damage. \n\nThe author is conflicted but financially strained. They've already helped by apologizing and being present. Cremation is the owner's choice for closure, but the author isn't obligated to pay for that. So, ethically, they might not be in the wrong for refusing, especially given their circumstances.\n"
