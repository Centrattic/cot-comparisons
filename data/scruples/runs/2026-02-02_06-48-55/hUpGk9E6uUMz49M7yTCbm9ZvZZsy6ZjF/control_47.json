I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they accidentally hit and killed someone's dog while driving. The dog was in a cornfield and ran out suddenly. The person tried to brake but couldn't avoid it. The dog's owner is asking them to pay for cremation and a memorial, which costs $150. The person is a broke college student, already dealing with a $1000 deductible from their car insurance, and they feel it wasn't their fault because the dog was let loose.\n\nFirst, in terms of legal responsibility, when you cause an accident, you're generally responsible for damages, but when it comes to animals, it's a bit different. If the owner was letting the dog roam off-leash where it shouldn't be, that might reduce the driver's liability. The person didn't hit the dog on purpose, it was a sudden, unavoidable accident. Legally, they might not be obligated to pay for cremation unless there's a specific law requiring that. However, in terms of moral or social responsibility, people might expect some compensation as a gesture of goodwill, even if it's not legally required.\n\nThe person is in a tough financial situation. They mentioned being a broke college student and already dealing with car repairs. The cost of $150 is significant for them. The owner, while upset, also had the dog that was loose. The dog's owner could be at fault for not keeping the dog confined, especially near a cornfield close to a road. The author tried to make things right by wrapping the dog in an emergency blanket and apologizing, showing they felt remorse.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying. Legally, probably not, especially if the dog was at fault for being in a dangerous place. Morally, some might argue that since the person caused the accident, even if accidental, they should offer some compensation. However, given the circumstances\u2014accidental, no prior malice, and the owner's possible negligence in letting the dog roam\u2014it's a gray area. The author's financial hardship is a significant factor. They might be in the right not to pay if they can't afford it, and the owner's request seems more like an emotional ask rather than a legal one. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
