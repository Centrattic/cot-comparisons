You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after 20 years in the country. The scenario involves a heated argument where the daughter criticizes her mother's lack of effort in learning the language, and the mom responds with excuses and even calls the daughter an animal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal factors. The mother has been in the country for 20 years but claims she doesn't plan to stay long. Her reasons for not learning English include not wanting to \"waste time,\" being a mother with no time, and focusing on religion instead. The daughter feels frustrated because she believes not knowing the language is causing problems for her mom, especially when dealing with everyday issues.\n\nThe daughter mentions her mom used to preach about the importance of knowledge and education, which adds irony. The argument escalated quickly, leading to insults and the daughter making a sarcastic comment about old age.\n\nFrom a cultural perspective, language learning is often seen as important for integration, but individuals have different reasons for not engaging in it. The mother's decision might be influenced by her plans to leave, her current responsibilities, or personal priorities. However, the daughter's frustration is valid in wanting her mom to adapt to make life easier.\n\nBut the way the argument unfolded matters. The daughter's comment about her mom's unwillingness could come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially when the mother is defensive. The use of phrases like calling someone an animal and making a sarcastic remark about old age crosses into disrespectful territory, which is why the mom's reaction might be justified, even if her arguments are weak.\n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable, but the way she expressed it led to an explosive argument. The mother's response was harsh, but the daughter's approach might not have been constructive. Encouraging someone to learn a language is reasonable, but the tone and context\u2014especially during a heated exchange\u2014could make the criticism feel personal rather than helpful.\n\nSo, the key points are: the daughter's frustration is valid, but her approach was confrontational and disrespectful. The mother's excuses are questionable, but her response was also harsh. The author is in the wrong for not handling the situation calmly and for making a hurtful comment about her mother's age.\n"
