You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mother for not learning the language of the country where she's lived for 20 years. The mother and father can barely speak English, and the author made a comment about that, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother has been in the country for 20 years but doesn't see herself staying long-term. She also mentioned she's a mother and doesn't have time to learn the language now. She also said she wants to focus on religion instead. The author is upset because they think their mother should have tried harder to learn English, especially since she used to talk about the importance of education from the prophet.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's reasons for not learning English. She claims she doesn't plan to stay long, which might be a valid reason if she's planning to return to her home country. Also, being a mother with time constraints could be a real barrier. On the other hand, the author is frustrated because learning the language could help her mother navigate daily life better, especially when she's complaining about difficulties in an English-speaking country.\n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable because improving language skills could make life easier, but pushing someone who is resistant might not be the best approach. The mother's argument about not wanting to invest time if she's not staying long-term makes sense. Also, the mother's decision to prioritize religion over other things is her personal choice. The author's comment about old age and being unreasonable could have been hurtful, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nHowever, the author's intention to encourage their mother isn't wrong. Wanting to support parents in adapting can be positive. But the way it was approached might have been confrontational, leading to the argument. The mother's reaction, including calling the author an animal, indicates that the conversation was heated and possibly disrespectful from both sides.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the manner in which they did so could have been more constructive. The mother has her own reasons, which the author didn't seem to acknowledge during the argument. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed but could have handled the situation better. However, according to the options given (A or B), the user wants a binary choice. Since the mother has valid reasons and the author's approach was confrontational, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to consider each other's perspectives.\n"
