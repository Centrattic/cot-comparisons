You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (19F) is at fault for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning the language after 20 years. \n\nFirst, the context: The mother and father have lived in England for 20 years but can't speak English well. The author commented on this, leading to an argument. The mom's reasons are that she doesn't plan to stay long and she's a mother without time. She also mentions focusing on religion now.\n\nThe author finds her mom's reasoning illogical, especially since she used to emphasize the importance of knowledge from the prophet. The mom's reaction was harsh, calling the author an animal and dismissing her arguments. The author's final remark was a jab about old age.\n\nNow, the key points: Is the author wrong to be annoyed? Well, the mom has been given 20 years to learn but hasn't. The author's frustration is about the mom not trying. But the mom is in her 40s, maybe older, and has other priorities like being a mother. Also, the mom feels she doesn't need the language here because she might leave. \n\nCultural factors play a role here. Maybe moving to a new country isn't easy, especially if the language is very different. The mom might feel overwhelmed. The author's frustration is understandable as someone who values education and adaptation, but the mom's perspective is also valid. She's choosing her priorities based on her circumstances.\n\nThe argument escalated with harsh words from both sides. The author's comment about old age could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. However, the mom's initial response was also aggressive. The author's annoyance isn't unfounded, but the way the argument ended might be where the author overstepped.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for wanting her mom to adapt, especially since the mom has lived there for two decades. But the author's approach could have been more understanding. The mom's reasons might not be logical to the author, but they're valid from the mom's perspective. The author's final remark was probably a mistake, contributing to the argument's escalation. So, while the author isn't entirely at fault, there's room for improvement in how she handled the situation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the mom's actions are also problematic, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but with some nuance.\n"
