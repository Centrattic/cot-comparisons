You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the daughter) is in the wrong for getting annoyed with her mother for not learning English after living in the UK for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 19, and her mother is 47. They had an argument where the daughter criticized her mother for not learning the language, and the mother responded by saying she doesn't see herself staying long, is busy as a mother, and wants to focus on religion instead. The daughter then references a religious teaching her mother used to mention, which the mother didn't follow, leading to a shouting match.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's intentions and the mother's reasons. The daughter might believe that learning the language is important for integration and solving problems. However, the mother has her own reasons: she might not plan to stay long, is busy with family, and prioritizes religion. The mother's stance could be based on practicality or personal choice rather than laziness.\n\nIs the daughter's annoyance justified? Well, she's trying to encourage her mother, which isn't inherently wrong, but the way the argument escalated might be where the issue lies. Insinuating that her mother is wrong for not learning, especially in a heated argument, could come off as dismissive of her reasons. The mother's reasons, while maybe not what the daughter expects, are valid personal choices. \n\nThe daughter's comment about the prophet's teaching and then calling the mother's behavior a result of old age could be seen as disrespectful. The mother might feel judged, especially since she's in a position where she's not the one initiating the conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is in a situation where she might feel frustrated because her mother's lack of English is causing issues. But pushing for immediate change might not be the best approach, especially in a close family dynamic.\n\nConsidering all this, the daughter's intentions are good, but the way she expressed her frustration and the argument that followed might be where she's in the wrong. It's about how the message was delivered and the respect given to her mother's choices.\n"
