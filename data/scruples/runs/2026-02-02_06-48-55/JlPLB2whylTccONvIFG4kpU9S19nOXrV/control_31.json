You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language after 20 years in the country.\n\nFirst, the author is 19 and just had an argument. The mum and dad can't speak English well. The author made a comment about them not putting effort into learning, which led to an argument. The mum's side is that she doesn't plan to stay long, is a mother without time, and now only wants to focus on religion. The author remembered the mum used to talk about the importance of education from a prophet, which the mum now ignores.\n\nThe user is seeking validation if the author is right to be annoyed. So, the key points here are the author's frustration with the parents' lack of effort versus the parents' reasons. The author isn't wrong for wanting their parents to adapt, but the way the argument escalated might be an issue. The mum's reasons might have some validity too, like time constraints and changing priorities. However, the author's annoyance isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach could have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about the approach. The mum's refusal to learn and the argument's escalation might shift responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated, but maybe the comment about old age was harsh. However, the main question is about the author's annoyance. Considering all, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for trying to encourage education and being annoyed at the unwillingness. The mum's reasons don't fully justify her stance, especially given the 20-year duration. So B seems right.\n"
