You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a 19-year-old female who had an argument with her mother, a 47-year-old who has lived in England for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The author got annoyed and made a comment about her parents not trying to learn the language. The mother responded by saying she doesn't see the point since she doesn't plan to stay in the country long and is too busy as a mother to learn the language. The author then pointed out that the mother used to talk about the importance of knowledge and education, leading to an argument where the mother called her an animal and the author made a sarcastic comment about old age.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's intentions. She was trying to encourage her mother to learn the language for better integration and problem-solving. That seems reasonable. However, the way she expressed her frustration might have been harsh. Making an offhand comment that escalated into an argument suggests that the approach might not have been the best. The mother's resistance is also important here. She feels that learning English isn't necessary because she doesn't plan to stay, and she's a mother with other priorities. The author's reminder about the prophet's teaching about knowledge could have been a good point, but the argument turned emotional.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to encourage her mother versus the mother's right to her own priorities. The author isn't wrong for wanting her mother to improve her English, as it can help in daily life. However, getting annoyed and confronting her in a way that leads to an argument might not be the best approach. The mother's reasons for not learning the language\u2014like not planning to stay and being occupied with being a mother\u2014are valid. The author's comment about old age is a bit disrespectful, which could be a mistake. But overall, the author's intentions are understandable. The question is whether the method was appropriate. Since the author was trying to encourage and the mother was resistant, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the way the confrontation happened might be where things went wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
