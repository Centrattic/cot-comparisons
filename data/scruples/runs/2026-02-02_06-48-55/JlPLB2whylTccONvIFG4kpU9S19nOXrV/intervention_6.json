You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter got into an argument with her mum, who has lived in England for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The mum claims she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan to stay long and is focused on religion. The daughter got annoyed and confronted her, leading to a heated argument where the mum called her an animal.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's intentions vs. how she expressed them. The daughter might think it's reasonable to encourage her mum to learn the language for integration, but she approached it in a confrontational way. The mum might feel disrespected or criticized, especially since she's choosing not to prioritize learning English. The daughter's comment about the prophet's teachings adds another layer, as the mum might perceive it as the daughter accusing her of hypocrisy.\n\nI need to consider cultural and familial dynamics. In some cultures, pushing parents to assimilate might be seen as disrespectful, especially if they're maintaining their heritage. Also, the mum's age and the fact that she's a mother with other responsibilities could be factors. The daughter's tone led to an argument, which might have been avoidable if approached differently.\n\nIs the daughter wrong for being annoyed? It's natural to feel frustrated, but the way she expressed it might have been hurtful. The mum's reasons for not learning might be valid\u2014maybe she's part of a community where she doesn't need English much, or she's focused on her faith. The daughter's approach was confrontational, leading to a negative reaction. So, the daughter might be in the wrong for the way she handled it, even if her intention was to help. The answer could be A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The mum's response was also harsh, but the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. Since the daughter's actions led to the argument and she used a preachy tone, maybe she's in the wrong. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
