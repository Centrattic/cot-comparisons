You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, the author made a comment about their parents not speaking English well, which led to an argument. The mom responded by saying she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother with no time. She also shifted to focusing on religion. The author was trying to encourage their mom to learn the language, which the mom resisted, leading to the conflict.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal factors here. The mom has been in the country for two decades. Maybe she's from a different culture where learning the local language wasn't prioritized, or perhaps there were barriers like language classes not being accessible. The mom's reasons\u2014no time, not planning to stay, focusing on religion\u2014might be her genuine feelings. But the author's frustration stems from wanting their mom to integrate more effectively, which is understandable given the mom's complaints about difficulties in an English-speaking country.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have come off as accusatory. Instead of constructive encouragement, the tone might have been harsh, especially when the mom was already frustrated. The argument escalated when the author mentioned the prophet's teachings about education, which the mom dismissed. The author's final comment about old age being unreasonable could have been hurtful and dismissive of the mom's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting their parent to improve their English if it helps them navigate daily life. But the way it was communicated might have been the issue. The key points are the method of communication and respect for the mom's autonomy. The mom's resistance could stem from feeling judged or not being heard. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but their approach could have been more empathetic. So, considering both sides, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because the desire to encourage learning isn't wrong, but the manner could be improved.\n"
