You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between a 19-year-old daughter and her mother who's lived in an English-speaking country for 20 years but doesn't speak much English. The daughter got annoyed and had an argument because she thought her mom wasn't making an effort to learn the language. The mom, on the other hand, says she doesn't want to invest time in learning a language for a country she doesn't plan to stay in and that she's a mother without time. She also mentioned focusing on religion instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The daughter's point is valid in a way\u2014learning the local language can help integrate and navigate daily life. But the mom has her reasons. Maybe she's not staying long, so she doesn't see the point. Also, the mom is 47 and maybe has other priorities. The daughter called her out for not trying, which might have come off as disrespectful, especially since the mom is her parent.\n\nThe argument escalated quickly. The daughter made a comment in passing, but it turned into a big fight. The mom's response included personal attacks, calling her an \"animal,\" which is definitely wrong. However, the daughter's tone and approach might have been harsh. She might have been right to want her mom to learn English for practical reasons, but the way she expressed it could have been more considerate. The mom's reasons for not learning might be valid, especially if she's not staying long and feels she doesn't have time.\n\nAlso, the daughter mentioned her mom used to talk about the importance of knowledge, so there's a contradiction here. The mom might feel disrespected by the daughter pointing that out. The daughter's last remark about old age being unreasonable was probably a low blow, even if it's true that the mom's reasoning seems contradictory. That kind of comment can hurt and isn't helpful in resolving the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the daughter isn't entirely in the wrong because she has a valid concern. But her approach was confrontational and maybe disrespectful. The mom's response was also inappropriate. However, since the question is about the daughter's actions, she might be at fault for how she handled the situation, even if her intentions were good. The key is whether encouraging education is wrong, but the method of doing so in a heated argument without considering her mom's circumstances might be where she's in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, the mom's reasons for not learning the language are her choice. The daughter has no control over that. The daughter's annoyance is understandable, but the way she expressed it led to an argument. So maybe the daughter is in the wrong for escalating it and not being understanding of her mom's decision to not learn the language. Alternatively, maybe it's a mutual issue, but the question is specifically about the daughter's actions. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she approached the topic in a way that caused an argument, and her comment about old age was disrespectful. Even though her intentions were to encourage learning, the method was flawed.\n"
