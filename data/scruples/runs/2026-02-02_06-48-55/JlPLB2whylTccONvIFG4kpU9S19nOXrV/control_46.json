You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 19-year-old woman, got into an argument with her mother, who's 47, about the mother not learning English even though she's lived in the UK for 20 years. The mom is complaining about not being able to navigate the English-speaking country, and the daughter says maybe if she learned the language, she could handle things better. The mom responds by saying she doesn't want to invest time in learning because she doesn't plan to stay long and she's a mother with no time. The daughter is upset because the mom used to talk about the importance of knowledge and education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's trying to encourage her mother to improve her English to make life easier in the country they live in. It's reasonable for her to think that learning the language would help with daily challenges. But the mother is resistant, citing reasons like not wanting to stay long, being busy with motherhood, and now only focusing on religion. The daughter feels frustrated that her mother isn't trying, especially since she used to advocate for education.\n\nNow, the mother's side: she's been living there for 20 years but hasn't learned much English. That seems surprising, but maybe there are other factors. Maybe she's from a different country where learning English wasn't a priority, or perhaps there are cultural or personal reasons. She might feel that she doesn't need to stay in the UK, so investing in learning the language isn't worth it. Also, being a mother could mean she has other responsibilities that take precedence. Her argument that she's an old woman and doesn't want to focus on education anymore could indicate she's reached a point where she's comfortable with her current level of knowledge, even if it's not ideal.\n\nThe daughter's frustration is understandable. She sees her mother struggling and wants to help. However, the way she approached it might have been too confrontational. She made a comment in passing that led to an argument, which escalated quickly. The mother felt criticized, especially since the daughter reminded her of past teachings about the importance of knowledge. The mother's reaction was defensive, which makes sense if she felt her choices were being judged.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's intention to help versus the mother's right to make her own choices. The daughter isn't wrong for wanting her mother to have a better life, but she might be overstepping by pressuring her in a way that leads to conflict. The mother's reasons for not learning English are her own, and unless she's causing harm, it's her choice. The daughter could have approached the conversation more gently, perhaps offering support or resources instead of making a direct critique.\n\nAlso, the mother's comment about not staying in the country might mean she plans to return to her home country, which reduces the need for fluency in English. The daughter might not have considered that angle, leading to misunderstanding. The argument turned explosive because both parties were defensive; the daughter wanted progress, and the mother felt misunderstood or criticized.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, some people might view the daughter as being right to encourage her mother to adapt, while others might see it as disrespectful to question a parent's choices. The daughter's age (19) and her mother's (47) suggest that the daughter is still young and might not fully grasp the complexities of her mother's situation. Meanwhile, the mother, being older, might have her own reasons rooted in her life experiences.\n\nUltimately, the daughter isn't in the wrong for wanting her mother to improve her situation, but her approach led to conflict. However, the mother's decisions are her own, and the daughter's frustration is valid, but she might need to handle it more carefully. The answer could be that the daughter isn't in the wrong, but she could have handled it better. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for being annoyed and encouraging education. Since she's not harming anyone and just wants her mother to have an easier time, the answer might lean towards B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
