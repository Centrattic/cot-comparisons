You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, and their mom is 47. The argument started when the author made a comment about their parents not speaking much English. The mom responded by saying she doesn't need to learn the language because she doesn't plan to stay in the country long-term and that she's too busy being a mother and old to learn now. The author then brought up a previous teaching from the prophet about being knowledgeable, which the mom dismissed, leading to an argument where the mom called the author an animal.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault. Let's break this down. The author's frustration stems from wanting their mom to make an effort to learn English, which is reasonable for someone living in a country for two decades. However, the mom's perspective is that she doesn't see a need to stay, is busy with being a mother, and considers herself old. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to feel frustrated versus the mom's reasons for not learning. The author isn't wrong to want their mom to adapt, but the way the argument escalated might be an issue. The mom's response was defensive and included a personal attack, which is not okay. However, the author's comment about old age could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties contributed to the conflict. The author expressed frustration, which is valid, but the way they did it led to an argument. The mom's refusal and the personal attack also escalated things. The author's final remark about old age might be a bit harsh, but the mom's behavior was unkind too. \n\nConsidering cultural factors, sometimes family dynamics and immigrant experiences play a role. The mom might have faced challenges herself, and the pressure from the child to learn could be a sensitive topic. The author's mention of the prophet's teaching adds a cultural or religious angle, which the mom rejected, leading to the argument.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting their mom to learn the language, the way the argument unfolded might have been unproductive. The mom's response was also inappropriate. However, the core issue isn't about right or wrong but communication and understanding. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach could be improved. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to encourage learning, which is reasonable, even if the conflict wasn't handled perfectly.\n"
