You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the daughter) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom moved to the UK 20 years ago and has not learned English well. The daughter is upset because the mom is complaining about difficulties in a country where the language is a barrier. The daughter argues that learning the language would help, but the mom claims she doesn't want to because she doesn't plan to stay long and is too busy as a mother. The mom also mentions focusing on religion and being an old woman, which the daughter finds contradictory to her previous teachings about education.\n\nSo, the daughter is frustrated because she thinks her mom should make an effort to integrate. But the mom has her own reasons. The daughter's comment about the mom's unwillingness being a reason for her problems might come off as judgmental or dismissive of the mom's circumstances. The mom's response was defensive, and the argument escalated. \n\nIs the daughter wrong? Well, the daughter's intention is to encourage her mom, which is understandable. However, the way she expressed her frustration during an argument might have been harsh. The mom's reasons might be valid\u2014maybe she does plan to leave, maybe she's dealing with other priorities. The daughter's remark about \"wasting time\" and the mom's unwillingness could be seen as invalidating the mom's choices and life circumstances. \n\nAlso, the daughter brought up the prophet's teaching, which the mom contradicted, leading to a personal attack. The daughter's comment about old age could be seen as disrespectful. While the daughter's frustration is valid, the approach might have been inconsiderate. So, maybe the daughter is partly in the wrong for not considering her mom's perspective and for the harsh way she communicated her points. \n\nBut the mom also has a responsibility to acknowledge that her lack of effort is affecting her ability to navigate the country. However, the daughter's right to express her opinion isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might be that the daughter isn't in the wrong, but her approach could have been better. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the mom's reasons are legitimate, then the daughter's annoyance might be misplaced. But if the mom's attitude is affecting their life, the daughter has a point. \n\nI think the key here is whether the daughter's criticism was justified. The mom has made choices, even if the daughter disagrees. The daughter's tone and the argument's escalation might make her in the wrong. So, maybe answer A.\n"
