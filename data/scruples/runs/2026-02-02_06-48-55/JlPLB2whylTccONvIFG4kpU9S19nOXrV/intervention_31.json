You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed with her mother who hasn't learned the local language despite living there for 20 years. The mother argues she doesn't have time, doesn't plan to stay, and prefers to focus on religion. The author brought up the mother's lack of effort, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, consider the mother's perspective. She's lived in the country for 20 years but may not have had the opportunity, resources, or motivation to learn the language. Maybe she's been busy with family, work, or cultural barriers. Also, she mentions she doesn't see herself staying long, so maybe she didn't prioritize it. Her comment about focusing on religion could mean that's her priority now.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Encouraging integration can be important for practical reasons, like navigating daily life. But the approach matters. The author's comment might have come off as dismissive or critical, especially if the mother felt judged. The argument escalated quickly, with the mother feeling attacked, leading to a harsh response.\n\nIs it fair to judge the mother? She might have had reasons the author isn't aware of. The author's comment about \"wasting\" time might have been perceived as implying the mother's efforts are unnecessary. The mother's reaction, calling the author an animal, is extreme, but it shows she felt deeply criticized. The author's final remark about old age could have been hurtful.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? It's a balance. The author has a valid concern but handled it poorly. The mother's lack of effort is a fact, but the author's frustration led to an argument. The author might not be entirely wrong for feeling frustrated, but the way they expressed it contributed to the conflict. The mother has her own priorities, and the author's judgment might not consider her circumstances. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to encourage, but the execution was flawed. Alternatively, A if the author was too harsh. But since the question is about being in the wrong, it's nuanced. The mother's lack of effort is there, but the author's approach could be improved. The answer is probably B.\n"
