You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a daughter getting annoyed at her mom for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. The daughter made a comment, which led to an argument. The mom argues she doesn't have time because she's a mother and she doesn't plan to stay here long. The daughter thinks her mom is being unreasonable, especially since the mom used to talk about the importance of knowledge.\n\nHmm. The daughter's intention is to encourage her mom to learn English, which is understandable. But maybe her approach was too harsh? She called her mom's arguments invalid and made a comment about old age, which could be hurtful. The mom's response was defensive, maybe even lashing out. But the key here is whether the daughter was wrong in expressing her annoyance.\n\nOn one hand, the daughter is right that learning the local language could help her mom navigate life better. On the other hand, the mom has her own reasons for not prioritizing it. The daughter's frustration is valid, but her reaction might have been unkind. Arguing and storming off might not be the best way to handle it. Also, the mom's age and cultural background might play a role in her decision not to learn the language. Maybe the daughter should approach this with more empathy instead of criticism. \n\nThe question is if the daughter is in the wrong. Since she's advocating for something reasonable but her method was confrontational, it's a mix. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural context and family dynamics. However, in terms of right and wrong, the daughter's intention is good, but her approach might have been wrong. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for her to reflect on how she expressed her thoughts. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Let's see. The daughter's annoyance is understandable, but the way she handled it could be seen as unkind. But the mom's response was also harsh. However, the question is about whether the daughter is in the wrong. I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong because she's advocating for something reasonable, even if her delivery was poor. But maybe the answer is A if we consider that she had no right to get annoyed. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But given the context, maybe B is the right choice because the daughter isn't wrong for wanting her mom to learn English, even if the argument wasn't handled perfectly.\n"
