You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mother for not learning the language of the country they've lived in for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother and father live in England, have lived there for 20 years, but can't speak English well. The author made a comment about that, leading to an argument. The mother's response was that she doesn't plan to stay long, she's a mother with no time, and she wants to focus on religion now. The author was trying to encourage education, referencing a religious teaching about being knowledgeable. The mother got angry, called the author an animal, and the author responded with a joke about old age.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. The author's frustration is understandable\u201420 years in a country without learning the language might be seen as not integrating. But the mother's perspective is important too. She might feel that her time is limited, she's a mother, and she's focused on other things. Also, she mentioned she doesn't plan to stay, so maybe she doesn't see the point. \n\nThe author used religion against her, bringing up a past teaching. That could be hurtful. The argument escalated quickly, and the mother's reaction was strong. The author's comment about old age might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, while the author had valid concerns, the way they approached it and the mother's defensiveness suggest that the author might have overstepped. The mother's reasons, though frustrating, are her own priorities. The author could have approached the topic more sensitively. However, the mother's response was also harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. The author's annoyance isn't entirely wrong, but the way they expressed it and the mother's reaction both contribute. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author was trying to encourage education, which is a good intention, but the method was not respectful or considerate of the mother's reasons, maybe the author is partly at fault. However, the mother's dismissiveness and the context of her not learning the language after 20 years also play a role. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the author was trying to encourage something positive, but the way they did it could be improved. The mother's reaction was harsh, but the author's frustration is valid. However, the author's comment about old age was probably too much. But overall, the core issue is the mother's lack of effort, not the author's initial annoyance. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but their approach could be better. But in the AITA framework, sometimes the main question is whether the person is in the wrong. Since the author's main point is valid, but their approach had flaws, perhaps the answer is B. But I'm a bit torn. Wait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong. But I think the author isn't entirely wrong. So answer B.\n"
