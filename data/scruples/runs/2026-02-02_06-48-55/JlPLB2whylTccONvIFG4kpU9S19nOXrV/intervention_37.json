You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author getting annoyed with their mum for not learning the English language despite living in the country for 20 years. The author made a comment about how if their parents tried harder to learn English, they could handle their problems better. The mum responded by saying she doesn't want to waste time learning because she doesn't plan to stay long and is focused on religion instead.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to encourage their mum to learn the language. That seems reasonable because learning the local language can help integrate into a community, access services, and communicate better. However, the author's approach might have come off as judgmental or dismissive of their mum's reasons. The mum has a valid point about not wanting to invest time if she doesn't plan to stay long. Also, she mentioned being a mother with no time, which adds context to her situation. \n\nThe argument escalated quickly, and the author used a comment about old age, which could be hurtful. The mum also made some harsh remarks, like calling the author an animal. It's possible that the author's frustration was justified, but the way the confrontation happened might have been disrespectful. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author had a valid concern but might have handled it poorly. The mum's reasons for not learning English might not be sufficient, but her perspective is also valid. The key is whether the author's annoyance and the manner of expressing it were appropriate. Since the author's actions led to an argument and used a potentially hurtful remark, it's possible they are in the wrong. However, the mum's response wasn't without fault either. \n\nI think the answer is A because the author's approach was confrontational and may have dismissed their mum's valid reasons. Encouraging someone to learn is fine, but doing so in a way that's disrespectful or judgmental isn't helpful. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding. So, the author is in the wrong for how they handled the situation, not the content of their opinion itself.\n"
