You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is 19, and her mom has been in the country for 20 years but can't speak English well. The author was trying to encourage her mom to learn, but the mom says she doesn't want to because she doesn't plan on staying and she's a mother without time, plus she's old and wants to focus on religion. \n\nThe author got annoyed and called her mom out, leading to an argument. The mom then called the author an animal and said her arguments were invalid. The author says she's confused because her mom used to preach about the importance of education and knowledge according to the prophet.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to help her mom integrate, which could be seen as reasonable. But maybe she was too harsh? The mom might feel that her choices are respected, especially regarding her age, time constraints, and cultural priorities. \n\nThe mom's reasons might not make sense to the author, but the author's frustration could stem from wanting to support her mom. However, getting annoyed and confronting her in that way might not be the best approach. The mom's response was also harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author's intentions are good, but the way she expressed her frustration might have been unhelpful. The mom's reasons, while maybe not fully valid in the author's eyes, are her own choices. The key here is whether the author was wrong for being annoyed. Since the mom is an adult and can make her own decisions, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her to learn but is in the wrong for how she handled it. However, the question is specifically about being annoyed, not the argument itself. \n\nSo, considering that the author is trying to encourage her mom for her benefit, even if the mom isn't taking it seriously, the author's frustration is understandable. The mom might not be in the right for not learning, but the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
