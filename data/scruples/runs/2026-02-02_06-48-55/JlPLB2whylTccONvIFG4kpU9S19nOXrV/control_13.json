You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the daughter getting annoyed at her mum for not learning English after 20 years in the UK. The mum argues she doesn't need to learn it since she doesn't plan to stay long, and she's a mother with no time. The daughter feels it's important for her to learn the language and customs to navigate the country better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The daughter's point is valid because learning the language can help with daily life, integration, and opportunities. But the mum has her own reasons: maybe she doesn't plan to stay, maybe she feels her time is better spent on other things, like religion or family. Also, she's a mother of two, so time constraints might be real. \n\nThe daughter's approach might have been confrontational, bringing up old teachings about education which the mum then dismissed. The argument escalated, leading to shouting and hurtful words. The daughter called her mum old and irrational, which is unkind. The mum's reaction was defensive, maybe feeling judged or criticized for not meeting certain expectations.\n\nIs the daughter wrong for being annoyed? Well, having a desire for her mum to improve her life is understandable, but the way she expressed it led to an argument. The key here is the approach. If the daughter was trying to help but in a way that was dismissive of her mum's reasons, that's a problem. Also, the daughter's last comment about old age was probably unhelpful and hurtful, even if she was upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the mum's stance might be based on her own priorities and circumstances. She might feel that her time is limited here, or that she's prioritizing family over learning English. The daughter might not fully understand the pressures her mum faces, or the mum's reasons for not learning English. \n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? She had a valid concern but expressed it poorly, leading to an argument. The mum also has valid reasons. The daughter's frustration is understandable, but her tone and method were problematic. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's advocating for her mum's betterment, but her approach was flawed. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she was trying to encourage improvement but the method led to conflict, maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the way she ended the argument with a sarcastic comment about old age might tip the balance towards her being at fault. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe she's not in the wrong because her intentions were good. I think the answer is B, but not sure. Let me check again. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed and encouraging her mum. The answer depends on whether her annoyance is justified. Since she's trying to help, maybe not. But the way she did it was harsh. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the situation is complex and both sides have points.\n"
