You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 19-year-old woman arguing with her mother, who has been in the UK for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The daughter is frustrated because her mother isn't trying to learn the language, especially since the mother complains about difficulties due to language barriers. The mother claims she doesn't have time, doesn't want to learn, and wants to focus on religion now. The daughter brings up a past teaching about being knowledgeable, which leads to an argument.\n\nFirst, the daughter's frustration is understandable. She's pointing out a contradiction between her mother's complaints about the language and her refusal to learn it. The mother's reasoning seems contradictory because she's been in the country for 20 years, and learning the language would help her navigate daily life. The daughter is trying to encourage her mother, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she approached it might have been harsh, leading to an argument. The mother's resistance could stem from various factors like past experiences, lack of motivation, or feeling overwhelmed. The daughter might be in the right in wanting to encourage education, but the method and tone during the argument could be at fault. The mother's response is defensive, but that doesn't necessarily mean the daughter is wrong. It's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. The key is whether the daughter was justified in her annoyance. Since the mother's lack of effort is affecting their lives, the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong, but her approach might need adjustment. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
