You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning English after 20 years in the country. \n\nFirst, the author is 19, and their mom is 47. The argument started when the author commented on their parents' limited English. The mom argues that she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother with no time. She also mentions focusing on religion and being an old woman.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel the mom could solve problems better with better English. But the mom is resisting, possibly due to personal priorities or other reasons. The author cites a religious teaching about being knowledgeable, which the mom contradicts. The argument escalates, with the mom calling the author an animal and the author making a sarcastic comment about old age.\n\nNow, considering cultural and personal factors. Immigrants might face challenges learning a new language, especially if they feel transient. The mom's reasons\u2014lack of time, not planning to stay, and focusing on religion\u2014could be valid for her. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way the argument unfolded might be where the issue lies. Yelling, calling someone an \"animal,\" and making a sarcastic remark about old age are aggressive. However, getting annoyed at the mom's unwillingness isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the author's approach was respectful.\n\nThe author's approach might have been confrontational, using guilt-tripping by referencing a religious teaching. The mom's response is defensive, which led to an argument. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing frustration, but the manner could be problematic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed and encouraging education. The mom's reasons for not learning might not be \"nonsensical\" as the author claims, but are her choices. The author might not be wrong in wanting to help, but the method of confrontation could be an issue. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because wanting to encourage education isn't wrong, but the approach might take blame away. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Need to weigh both sides.\n"
