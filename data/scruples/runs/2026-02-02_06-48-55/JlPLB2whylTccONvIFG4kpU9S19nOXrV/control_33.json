You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language of the country where she's lived for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 19 and made a comment about their parents not speaking English well. The mum responded by saying she doesn't want to learn because she doesn't plan to stay there long and is too busy as a mother. The author got upset because the mum is contradicting her own past teachings about the importance of education.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, encouraging someone to learn the local language can be seen as helpful, especially for integration. But the mum's reasons might be valid too. She might not see the need if she's not staying, and she might have other priorities. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have approached it more gently. However, the mum's reaction was harsh\u2014calling the author an animal and dismissing their valid points. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment was in response to the mum's complaint about people using English to get things done. The author was pointing out a logical inconsistency. But the argument escalated. The author's annoyance isn't necessarily wrong, but maybe their approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The mum's defensiveness and contradiction of her own values might mean she's the one at fault here. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting their parent to put in effort, especially since it affects their own life. It's reasonable to be frustrated when someone doesn't follow through on their own advice. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for encouraging education, but the situation is complex. However, the author's approach might have been too harsh, leading to an argument. But the mum's refusal to engage and the harsh response make her partly responsible. The author's annoyance is justified given the context. So I think the answer is B.\n"
