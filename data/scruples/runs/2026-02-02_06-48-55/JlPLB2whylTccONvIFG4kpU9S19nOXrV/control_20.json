You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, and their mom is 47. The argument started because the mom was complaining about things being easier for English speakers in England. The author pointed out that maybe if she learned the language, she could handle her problems better. The mom responded by saying she doesn't plan to stay long and as a mother, she's too busy. She also changed her stance from valuing education to not wanting to learn, even though she used to preach about the importance of knowledge.\n\nThe author got annoyed and called their mom out for being unreasonable, leading to an argument. The key points here are the mom's unwillingness to learn despite the time she's been there, and the author's frustration over that. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid point about the benefits of learning the local language for integration and problem-solving. On the other hand, the mom has her own reasons: she might not plan to stay, she's a mother with limited time, and she's changed her perspective. \n\nBut the author's tone in the question suggests they feel justified in their annoyance. The mom's response was defensive and dismissive, which escalated the conflict. The author's comment about old age being unreasonable could be seen as disrespectful, but it's also a reaction to the mom's resistance to change or growth. \n\nConsidering cultural context, some people might prioritize their heritage and not see the need to learn another language if they're a minority or have a strong religious identity. However, the mom's argument about not wanting to invest time if she's not planning to stay might be valid, but she's been there for 20 years, so that's a long time. \n\nThe author isn't entirely wrong for wanting their mom to learn, but the way the argument escalated might be where the issue lies. The author's approach was confrontational, which led to the argument. The mom's defensiveness could be due to feeling criticized or misunderstood. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some accountability. The author could have approached the topic more gently, and the mom could consider the benefits of learning. But the core issue is the mom's refusal to engage. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, it's a balance between the valid points each side has. However, given that the author is trying to encourage growth and the mom is resistant without reasonable effort, the author's annoyance is understandable. So the answer might lean towards No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
