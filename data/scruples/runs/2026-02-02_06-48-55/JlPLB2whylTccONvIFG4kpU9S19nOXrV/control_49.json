You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the daughter) is at fault for getting annoyed with her mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 19, and her mom has been in the UK for 20 years but still struggles with English. The mom mentions not wanting to learn because she doesn't plan to stay long and is busy being a mother. She also refers to her age and focusing on religion.\n\nThe daughter is frustrated because she believes learning the language would help her mom navigate daily life better, especially since the mom complains about difficulties. The daughter cited a religious teaching about being knowledgeable in the land one lives, which the mom used to preach, adding a layer of hypocrisy she perceives.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether her frustration is justified. The mom has been living there for 20 years, which is a long time, but maybe she has valid reasons. However, the daughter's intention is to encourage her mother, which is understandable. But how she expressed it led to an argument. The mom's response was defensive, and the daughter's comment about old age might have been harsh.\n\nBut the main issue is the daughter's annoyance. Is it wrong to feel that way? Well, the mother's reasons (not planning to stay, being busy, age) could be legitimate. However, the daughter's point is that learning the language would help, even if temporarily. The daughter might not be in the wrong for wanting her mom to improve their lives through better communication. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational, leading to the argument.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not just the argument's escalation. The daughter's frustration is about her mom not trying, which could be seen as valid given the time they've been there. However, the mom's circumstances might also be valid. The daughter's tone and choice of words, like calling her an animal and the mom's retort about old age, are hurtful. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the daughter isn't entirely wrong. She's trying to encourage her mom, which is a good intention. But she could have handled it more sensitively. However, being annoyed at someone's lack of effort isn't inherently wrong. The mom's response was also harsh, which complicates things. \n\nSo, considering all that, the daughter isn't in the wrong for feeling frustrated and trying to encourage her mom. The answer is B (No), but with the note that her approach could have been better. The key is the intention versus the execution. The daughter isn't at fault for her stance, even if the argument's handling was poor.\n"
