You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the daughter) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. The mom says she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan to stay long and as a mother, she's too busy. The daughter found this odd, especially since the mom used to emphasize the importance of education from their religion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The daughter is frustrated because her mom isn't learning the local language, which is important for integration and dealing with daily life. The mom, on the other hand, might feel that the daughter is being pushy, especially since she's stated her reasons for not learning. The daughter's comment about old age and the mom's reaction of calling her an animal and dismissing her arguments point to some deeper issues, maybe about respect or generational differences.\n\nThe key points here are: the daughter's intention was to encourage, but the way she approached it led to an argument. The mom's reasons for not learning are her own choice, possibly influenced by her age, role as a mother, and her desire to focus on religion. It's important to note that people have different priorities and the right to choose how they spend their time. The daughter might not be in the wrong for wanting to encourage learning, but she might have been inconsiderate of her mom's reasons. Also, the mom's refusal to engage could be due to feeling judged or pressured. \n\nThe daughter's final words about old age being a sensitive topic might have crossed a line, even if she was upset. Insensitive remarks, even if made in frustration, can be hurtful. However, the mom's response was also harsh, calling her an animal. So maybe both parties have some responsibility here.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the daughter was being respectful in her encouragement, she might not be. But since the argument escalated, and she made a comment about old age, which is a sensitive subject, that could be seen as disrespectful. The mom has the right to choose her priorities, and the daughter might not have the right to make her feel guilty about that. The daughter's annoyance is understandable, but her approach might have been too confrontational. \n\nSo, considering the context of the argument and the specific words used, the daughter might have overstepped by implying her mom's choice is unreasonable without fully respecting her autonomy. On the other hand, the mom's refusal to learn could be a personal choice. The daughter's comment about old age being a joke might have been unwise. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because while her concern is valid, her approach was dismissive of her mom's reasons and included a potentially hurtful remark about old age. Encouragement should be respectful and considerate of others' circumstances, not judgmental.\n"
