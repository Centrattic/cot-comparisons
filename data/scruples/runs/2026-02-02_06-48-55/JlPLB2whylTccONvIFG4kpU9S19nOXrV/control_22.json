You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after 20 years in the country. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 19, and her mom is 47. They had an argument where the author expressed frustration that her parents don't speak English well despite living in an English-speaking country for two decades. The mother responded by saying she doesn't plan to stay long and doesn't have time because she's a mother now and just wants to focus on religion. The author is upset because the mom used to emphasize the importance of education and knowledge from the prophet, but now she's dismissing it. The argument escalated with the mom calling the author an animal and the author making a sarcastic comment about old age.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's frustration is understandable because learning a language is challenging, but after 20 years, one might expect some effort. However, the mom's perspective is also important. She might not plan to stay, or maybe there are other reasons\u2014like cultural identity, or maybe the education system here isn't accessible. Also, the mom might be dealing with her own stress as a parent and not have the capacity to learn a new language.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront her mom about it, which led to an argument. The tone of the question suggests the author feels justified, but maybe she could have approached it differently. However, the mom's refusal to learn and the invalidation of the author's point might have been frustrating. The mom's change in stance from preaching education to dismissing it could contribute to the tension.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The author isn't wrong to want her parents to learn the language for practical reasons. But the way she expressed her frustration might have been harsh, especially if it was in a heated moment. The mom's response was also unconstructive. However, the author's core concern isn't unreasonable. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's frustration is valid, though the confrontation might have been handled better.\n"
