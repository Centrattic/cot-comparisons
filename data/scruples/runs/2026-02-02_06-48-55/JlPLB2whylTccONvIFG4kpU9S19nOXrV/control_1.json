You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 19 and made a comment about their parents not speaking English well. The mom argued that she doesn't need to learn because she might not stay long and she's busy as a mother. The author felt the mom isn't putting in effort, but the mom is defensive, even bringing up religion and calling the author an animal. The author cited a previous religious teaching about being knowledgeable, which the mom contradicted.\n\nSo, the key points: The author wants the mom to learn the language for practical reasons. The mom has her reasons\u2014maybe she doesn't plan to stay, she's a mother, she thinks religion is more important. The argument escalated, leading to a harsh comment from the author about old age.\n\nNow, considering cultural and personal contexts. It's possible the mom moved from a non-English speaking country and has other priorities. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way the argument unfolded might have been harsh. The mom's response was defensive and disrespectful, but the author also called the mom's behavior as coming from old age, which is an insult.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to encourage learning, which is a valid desire. However, the approach might have been confrontational. The mom's reasons for not learning might be valid too. The argument's escalation suggests both parties had emotional reactions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to encourage education, but the manner of the argument and the harsh remarks might have contributed to the conflict. However, the mom's defensiveness and disrespectful responses also played a role. The answer depends on whether the author's annoyance and comments were reasonable. Since the mom's actions are a personal choice and the author's frustration is justified to some extent, but the way it was handled could be better, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong but could approach it differently.\n"
