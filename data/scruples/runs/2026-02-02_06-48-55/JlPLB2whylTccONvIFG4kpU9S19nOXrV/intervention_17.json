You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language of the country they've lived in for 20 years. The author is 19, their mom is 47. The argument started with a comment about the parents' limited English, which led to a bigger fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has been in the country for 20 years but hasn't learned the language. The author is frustrated and suggests that learning the language would help. The mom responds by saying she doesn't plan to stay long and as a mother, she's busy. She also mentions focusing on religion instead of education. The author brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable, which the mom then dismisses angrily.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's frustration versus the mom's perspective. The mom's reasons for not learning the language include not staying long, being a mother, and focusing on religion. The author is upset that the mom isn't making an effort, even though the mom feels it's not necessary.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, encouraging family to integrate can be seen as positive, but the method and context matter. The author's approach led to an argument, which might have been harsh. The mom's reasons might be valid; if she's not planning to stay, maybe she doesn't see the point. Also, being a mother is a full-time job, and language learning can be difficult, especially with age. The author's comment about the prophet's teaching adds another layer, implying the mom is contradicting her own values. However, the mom's reaction was emotional, calling the author an animal, which is extreme.\n\nIs getting annoyed justified? The author was trying to encourage learning, which is understandable. However, the way it was approached might have been confrontational. The mom's perspective was dismissed, leading to a conflict. The author's final remark about old age being unreasonable is unkind and might have escalated things unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intention might be good, but the execution could be better. The mom's reasons for not learning the language are valid, and dismissing them as not making sense is unhelpful. The argument could have been handled more respectfully. The author's annoyance is understandable, but the way it was expressed might have been inconsiderate. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they approached the situation.\n"
