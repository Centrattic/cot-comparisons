You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language of the country they've lived in for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is 19 and frustrated that their parents, who've been in the country for two decades, don't speak English well. They made a comment that led to an argument because the mother claims she doesn't see herself staying long, so learning the language is a waste. The mum also mentioned she's a mother and too old to focus on education, preferring religion instead. The author brings up a religious teaching about the importance of knowledge, which the mum then dismisses, leading to a shouting match.\n\nHmm. The author's frustration is understandable. It's reasonable to encourage someone to adapt to the country they're living in, especially when it affects their ability to navigate daily life. However, the mum's perspective is that she doesn't plan to stay long and is busy with family and religious matters. She might feel that the author is judging her choices, given that she's an older woman. The argument escalated because of the author's comment about her religion's teachings, which the mum took as criticism. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and approach. The author's intention might be good, but the way they brought it up could have been confrontational. Using religious teachings against the mum might have been perceived as an attack, especially if she's using religion to justify her stance. Also, the author's final remark about \"unreasonable comes with old age\" could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting their parents to integrate and have the tools to handle life in their new country. But the method of confrontation and the tone of the argument might have been the main issues here. The mum's lack of effort could be due to various reasons, like fear, low priority, or different values. The author's annoyance is valid, but the way they expressed it may have been hurtful and unproductive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's frustration is justified, but their approach might have been wrong. The mum's response was also defensive, but the author's comment about religion and the old age remark likely escalated things. Therefore, the author might be partly in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their initial frustration isn't entirely their fault.\n"
