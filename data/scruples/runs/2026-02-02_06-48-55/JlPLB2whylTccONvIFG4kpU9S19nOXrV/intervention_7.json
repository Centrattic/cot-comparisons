You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a comment about their parents' lack of English proficiency, which led to an argument. The mum responds by saying she doesn't plan to stay in the country long-term and doesn't have time as a mother. She also mentions focusing on religion and age as reasons not to learn. The author is frustrated because the mum previously emphasized the importance of education and knowledge, which contradicts her current stance.\n\nOn one hand, encouraging someone to learn the local language can be seen as positive, especially if it helps integration. However, the author's approach caused an argument, and the mum has valid reasons: maybe she doesn't plan to stay, feels time is limited, or has other priorities. The author's frustration might be justified if they see the language barrier as an issue, but their method of addressing it could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe mum's response was defensive, but she also mentioned her reasons. The author's comment about old age and being unreasonable might have crossed a line. The key is whether the author's annoyance was justified given the context. While wanting to learn English is good, the author's reaction might have been dismissive of their mum's circumstances. Maybe the author could have approached the conversation more compassionately instead of getting annoyed. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's frustration is reasonable. The mum's reasons might not be strong, but the author's handling of the situation could be at fault. The fact that the author's comment led to a harsh argument suggests that their approach was not constructive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
