You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 19 and had an argument with her mom about not learning English after living in the UK for 20 years. The mom claims she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan to stay and she's busy being a mother and focusing on religion. The daughter got annoyed and called her out, leading to a heated argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's trying to encourage her mom to adapt, which is a valid point. Learning the local language can help with integration and problem-solving. However, the mom has her own reasons. She might not see staying as a priority, and she's balancing family responsibilities. The daughter's comment about religion and the prophet's advice adds another layer. The mom's reaction was harsh, but the daughter's frustration might come from wanting her mom to take English seriously.\n\nBut wait, the daughter's approach led to an argument. Even if her intentions are good, the way she expressed her frustration might have been hurtful. The mom's reasons, while not ideal, are her personal choices. The daughter might have overstepped by getting annoyed and making passive-aggressive remarks. The phrase about old age was probably a low blow, even if it's true that sometimes people get inflexible with age.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's refusal to learn could be seen as a barrier to integration. The daughter's concern is valid, but the method of addressing it caused conflict. The answer depends on whether the daughter's approach was respectful. Since she got angry and used a derogatory comment, that's where she might be in the wrong. The mom's reasons, while not perfect, are personal choices, and the daughter's reaction was harsh.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for her tone and the specific comment she made. However, there's a middle ground where both could have approached the situation better. But based on the details, the answer leans towards A.\n"
