You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the daughter getting annoyed at her mother for not learning the language after 20 years in the country. The mother's reasons are that she doesn't plan to stay long and doesn't want to invest time, plus she's a mother and busy. Also, she mentions focusing on religion instead of education. The daughter got frustrated, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The daughter wants her parents to make an effort to learn the language, which is reasonable since they've been there 20 years. But the mother's perspective is important too. She might not feel the need if she plans to leave, and maybe she has other priorities. Also, the mother's age and time constraints could play a role. The daughter brought up the religious aspect where the prophet emphasized knowledge, which the mother dismissed, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the daughter wrong for being annoyed? Well, she's encouraging her parents to integrate for their own benefit, which is understandable. However, the mother has her own reasons. The daughter's frustration is valid, but the way the argument escalated might be a problem. The daughter called her mother out for being unreasonable related to old age, which could be harsh. The mother's response was also harsh, calling her an animal. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions are unreasonable. The daughter's intention is good, but the argument's escalation and the tone might make her partly at fault. The mother's refusal to learn could be due to personal choice and circumstances. So maybe the daughter isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps she could have approached it more calmly. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Since the mother's reasons are valid and the daughter's frustration is justified, but the argument's nature might have been unkind, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). However, considering that the daughter was trying to help and the mother was resistant, the daughter's annoyance isn't necessarily wrong. The mother's behavior was also unkind. So the daughter might not be in the wrong.\n"
