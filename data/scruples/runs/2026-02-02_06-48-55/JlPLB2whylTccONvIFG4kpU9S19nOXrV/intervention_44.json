You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a daughter who's annoyed with her mom for not learning English after living in the UK for 20 years. The mom argues she doesn't want to spend time learning the language because she doesn't plan to stay long and she's a mother with no time, plus she wants to focus on religion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The daughter thinks it's important for her mom to learn English to navigate daily life, maybe to avoid problems and fit in. The mom, on the other hand, has her reasons: she's not staying, she's busy with being a mother, and she prioritizes religion. \n\nThe daughter brings up a religious teaching about knowledge, which the mom used to preach, and that might have triggered the argument. The mom's response was harsh, calling her an animal and dismissing her arguments. The daughter's comment about old age being unreasonable is probably not helping.\n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. Well, encouraging someone to learn the local language can be seen as helpful, but the daughter's approach might have been confrontational. She made a comment in passing that escalated into an argument. Also, her final words about old age could be hurtful. However, the mom's refusal to engage and her dismissive attitude might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nCultural factors might play a role here too. The mom might come from a background where learning the local language wasn't a priority, or she faced challenges in learning it. The daughter's frustration is valid if she thinks the mom's lack of language skills causes problems. But the way she expressed her frustration led to an argument, which might make her partly responsible.\n\nI think the key points are: the daughter's intention to help vs. the method she used, the mom's valid reasons for not learning, and the emotional tone of the argument. Both could have handled it better, but the question is if the daughter is in the wrong. Since she was annoyed and made a comment that led to an argument, maybe she is partly at fault. However, wanting to encourage education isn't wrong. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with room for both sides to improve.\n"
