You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 19 and had an argument with their mom, who's 47. The mom has been living in a country (probably not her native one) for 20 years but doesn't speak the language well. The author is annoyed because the mom isn't trying to learn English, even though they've lived there for two decades. The mom's excuse is that she doesn't plan to stay long and that she's a mother with no time, plus she's older and focuses on religion now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. The mom might be from a different country, maybe where English isn't the first language. It's common for immigrants to face challenges learning a new language. The mom's reasons for not learning might be valid\u2014she might be busy with family, or she might have plans to return to her home country. Also, age could be a factor; learning a new language is harder as you get older, and maybe she feels it's not worth the effort now.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They might feel that learning the language is important for integration and solving problems. But the mom's perspective is that she doesn't have the time, doesn't want to stay, and that she's prioritizing other things like religion. The author brought up a religious teaching about being educated, which the mom used to preach, adding to the tension.\n\nWhen the author called their mom out for not trying, the mom reacted strongly, even calling the author an animal. The author's last comment about old age being unreasonable might have been harsh, but the mom's reaction was also extreme. The question is whether the author was wrong to feel annoyed and express that frustration.\n\nI think the key points are the mom's valid reasons (time, intent to stay, age) and the author's valid concern about integration. However, the way the author expressed their frustration might have been harsh. The mom's refusal to engage in self-improvement is a choice she's making based on her circumstances. The author's comment about old age was probably meant to be a jab, which isn't helpful, but the core issue is the mom's decision not to learn. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to encourage education, but maybe the approach could have been better. However, given the mom's excuses, the author's annoyance is somewhat justified. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
