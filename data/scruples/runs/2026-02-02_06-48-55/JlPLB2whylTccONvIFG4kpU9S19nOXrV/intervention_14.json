You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, and the mom is 47. They had an argument when the author commented that her parents can't speak English well despite living in England for two decades. The mom responded by saying she doesn't plan to stay long, doesn't have time because she's a mother, and just wants to focus on religion. The author then brings up a past religious teaching about being knowledgeable, leading to an argument where the mom calls the author an animal and says her arguments are invalid. The author storms off, saying something about old age.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author's frustration might be understandable\u2014living in a country for 20 years without learning the language could be seen as not integrating. But the mom's perspective is important too. Maybe she chose not to learn English because she doesn't plan to stay, or she's focused on family. Also, the author's approach might have been confrontational. The argument escalated quickly, and the author's last comment about old age could be hurtful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author overstepped. The author was trying to encourage learning, which is good, but the way it was handled led to an argument. The mom's reasons for not learning might be valid. The author's comment about the mom's old age is probably unkind. So maybe the author is partly at fault for the tone and the harsh remark. However, the mom's refusal to engage and the harsh response also contributed. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, both parties often have some responsibility. Here, the author might be in the right for wanting to learn, but the approach was poor. The mom's justification has flaws, but her reaction was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the validity of the author's concern and the manner in which it was expressed. Since the author's frustration led to a harsh response, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but could have handled it better. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the context.\n\nGiven that the mom has lived there 20 years and the author is trying to encourage learning, but the mom has her reasons, the author's annoyance is understandable. However, the argument's escalation and the final comment about old age might tip the balance. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because the way she expressed her frustration was hurtful. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a gray area. Maybe the answer is B, but I need to be careful.\n"
