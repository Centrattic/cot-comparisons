You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed with her mum for not learning the language after 20 years. \n\nFirst, the author is 19 and just had an argument with her 47-year-old mum. The mum has been in the country for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The author's comment about that led to an argument. The mum's reasons were that she doesn't plan to stay long, she's a mother without time, and now she only wants to focus on religion, referencing the prophet's advice about being knowledgeable. The mum got defensive, called the author an animal, and the author retorted by suggesting that being unreasonable comes with old age.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No). Here's why: The author's frustration is understandable as she's trying to help her mum adapt, which is a common concern. The mum's response is defensive and closed-minded, especially since she once promoted the value of education. The author's annoyance is a reaction to her mum's resistance to learning, which isn't unreasonable. However, the argument escalated with harsh words from both sides. While the author might not be entirely in the right for storming off and making a snide comment about old age, the main issue is the mum's refusal to engage despite the time she's spent there. The answer should be B, but it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
