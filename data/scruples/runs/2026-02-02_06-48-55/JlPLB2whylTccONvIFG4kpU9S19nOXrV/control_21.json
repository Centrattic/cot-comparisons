You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language after living in the country for 20 years. The situation involves an argument where the author criticizes the mum for not learning English, and the mum responds by saying she doesn't want to because she's a mother, doesn't have time, and doesn't plan to stay long. The mum also references religion and the prophet saying people should be knowledgeable, but now she's unwilling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 19, and their mum is 47. The mum has been living in the country for 20 years. The author's frustration comes from the mum's lack of effort to learn English, which the author sees as necessary for integration. The mum, on the other hand, has her reasons: time constraints, not wanting to stay long, focusing on religion instead.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are whether the author's annoyance is justified. The author's intention was to encourage the mum to educate herself, which is a valid concern for integration. However, the approach might have been confrontational, leading to an argument. The mum's reasons for not learning could be valid too\u2014maybe she's prioritizing family over language learning, or she feels it's not necessary for her situation. The author mentions that the mum used to preach about education, which adds a layer of inconsistency.\n\nThe argument escalated, with the mum calling the author an animal and the author making a sarcastic comment about old age. Both sides contributed to the conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it might have been harsh, especially considering the mum's perspective. The mum's refusal to learn could be due to personal choices or practical reasons, and the author might not have considered those fully before reacting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They expressed frustration in a way that led to an argument. Their intention was to encourage education, which is good, but the method might have been too confrontational. The mum also had a poor reaction, but the author's role in starting the argument by making a comment about their language skills is part of the issue. The answer probably leans towards the author being partially at fault for the approach, but not entirely in the wrong. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since both sides have issues, but the question is about the author specifically, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was reasonable, though the execution could be better. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the approach was too harsh. Need to decide based on the context.\n"
