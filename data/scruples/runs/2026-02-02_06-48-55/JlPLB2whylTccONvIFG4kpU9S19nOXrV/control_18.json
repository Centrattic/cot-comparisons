You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting annoyed with their mother who hasn't learned the local language after 20 years. \n\nFirst, the mother has lived in the country for 20 years but can't speak the language well. The author's comment was meant to encourage her to put in effort, but the conversation escalated into an argument. The mother's reasons include not wanting to spend time learning the language because she doesn't plan to stay long and being busy as a mother. She also later mentions focusing on religion and being an old woman.\n\nThe author is upset because the mother seems resistant to learning and doesn't see the value in it. The mother's response was defensive and aggressive, even calling the author an animal.\n\nNow, considering cultural and familial dynamics. In many immigrant families, especially those from cultures with strong traditional values, there might be a preference to maintain the native language and customs. The mother might feel that adapting to the local language isn't necessary if she doesn't plan to stay, or she might feel pressured to assimilate in a way that conflicts with her identity.\n\nThe author is trying to encourage their mother, which might be seen as well-meaning, but the way it was delivered could have been perceived as criticism or pressure. The mother's defensiveness suggests that the author's comment touched on deeper insecurities or frustrations. The mother's statement about not wanting to become educated and focusing on religion might indicate that she values her cultural and religious identity more than adapting to the new country.\n\nAge could also be a factor here. The mother is 47, and the author is 19. There's a significant generation gap, and the mother might feel that her life circumstances (being a mother, not planning to stay long) make learning a new language impractical or unnecessary. The author might not fully grasp the complexities of their mother's situation or the emotional resistance to assimilation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to be annoyed. The mother's lack of effort is clear, but the author's approach led to conflict. The mother's refusal to engage could be due to her own priorities, which the author might not have considered. The author's comment, while intended to help, might have come off as judgmental, especially given the mother's previous teachings about knowledge and education. The mother's reaction, including calling the author an animal, is unkind, but the question is about the author's fault.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting their parents to learn the language. However, the situation is nuanced. The mother's reasons might be valid from her perspective, and the author's annoyance might stem from frustration but without considering the mother's viewpoint. The argument's escalation suggests that communication broke down, but the core issue isn't about being wrong per se, but about differing priorities and perspectives. The answer might lean towards B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the author's intent was to encourage, even if the approach was flawed. But some might argue that the author should have been more understanding of the mother's position. However, given the information, the author's stance is reasonable, and the mother's resistance is the main issue here.\n"
