You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the daughter getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The daughter is 19 and feels frustrated because her mom and dad don't speak English well. She's trying to encourage them to learn, maybe for practical reasons like dealing with daily life in England. She brings up the mom's own advice from when she was a child about the prophet emphasizing knowledge and education. The mom responds by saying she doesn't want to learn, doesn't have time, and doesn't plan to stay long. The argument escalates, and the daughter makes a comment about old age and being unreasonable.\n\nThe daughter is trying to help, but her approach might come off as dismissive of her mom's perspective. The mom has valid reasons: maybe she's busy, doesn't see the point if she's not staying, or faces other barriers. The daughter's frustration is understandable, but the way she expressed it\u2014calling her mom an animal and making a sarcastic remark about old age\u2014might be hurtful. The mom's reaction is also harsh, but the daughter's comment could have been more empathetic.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal factors. Language learning is a big commitment. The mom might feel her time and energy are better spent elsewhere. The daughter's initial comment about the mom's unwillingness might be valid, but the argument could have been handled more constructively. Also, the daughter's final words about old age could be seen as disrespectful, which might have caused the mom to feel attacked.\n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? Maybe partially. While her intentions are good, her approach and the harshness of her words might have been the issue. The mom's response is also problematic, but the daughter's role in escalating the argument with sarcasm and insults could place some responsibility on her. The key points are the daughter's frustration being justified but the method of expression being uncivil. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to check if the daughter's core argument is reasonable. Encouraging someone to learn the language isn't wrong, but the way she delivered it could have been better. The problem is the tone and the insults rather than the content. So, maybe the daughter is in the wrong because of how she handled the situation, not the sentiment itself. So Answer A.\n"
