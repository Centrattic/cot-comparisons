You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mother for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. The situation involves a heated argument where the author criticizes their mother for not making an effort to learn the language, and the mother responds by saying she doesn't plan to stay long and doesn't have time because she's a mother and an older woman. The author then references a religious teaching about education, leading to the mother calling them an animal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother has been in the country for 20 years but hasn't learned the language. The author is trying to encourage her, but the mother is resistant, citing reasons like not planning to stay and being too busy. The author's frustration is understandable, as learning a language is a significant benefit in a new country. However, the mother's response might be rooted in personal choices or circumstances not discussed.\n\nNext, the argument escalated. The author's comment about the mother's unwillingness to learn led to an explosive argument. The mother's reaction was harsh, calling the author an animal. The author's final comment about old age being unreasonable could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. But is the author wrong for being annoyed? Well, wanting to encourage a parent to improve their situation isn't inherently wrong. However, the way the argument was handled might be the issue. The author's frustration is valid, but the confrontation might have been approached more calmly.\n\nThe mother's reasons for not learning English are important. She mentions not staying long and being a mother without time. These could be legitimate reasons. If she's planning to leave, investing time in learning might not be a priority. Also, balancing motherhood and other responsibilities is a real challenge. The author's criticism might not take these factors into account, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe religious teaching reference adds another layer. If the mother used to emphasize this point, the author's reminder could have been a valid point, but the mother's reaction suggests defensiveness. The author's final remark about old age could be seen as cutting, but it's a reaction to the mother's harsh words.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely wrong for being frustrated, as encouraging language learning can be beneficial. However, the approach of confronting the mother in a heated manner and making a comment about old age might be where the author crosses a line. The mother's reasons for not learning might be valid, so the author's annoyance isn't unjustified, but the way the argument unfolded could be seen as the author's fault for escalating it. However, the mother's response was also harsh. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong entirely, but there's room for both parties to have contributed to the conflict. But the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intent to encourage is understandable, but the method could be improved. However, since the mother made excuses that might not be fully considered by the author, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
