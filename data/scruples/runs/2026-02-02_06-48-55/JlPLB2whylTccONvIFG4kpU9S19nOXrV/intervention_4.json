You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mother for not learning English after 20 years. The situation involves a conflict between the daughter (19F) and her mother (47) where the daughter criticizes her mother for not making an effort to learn the language and customs of their current country. The mother responds by saying she doesn't plan to stay there long, doesn't have time because she's a mother, and now only wants to focus on religion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's frustrated that her parents, who have lived in the country for 20 years, aren't making an effort to learn the language. She argues that this lack of effort hinders their ability to navigate daily life. The daughter's intention might be to encourage her parents to integrate better, possibly for their own benefit and to support the family.\n\nOn the mother's side, she's pushing back by saying she doesn't plan to stay in the country long-term, so investing time in learning the language isn't necessary. She also mentions being a mother as a reason she can't prioritize learning. Additionally, she's focusing on religion now, which might be a personal choice. The mother's perspective is that her time and energy are directed elsewhere, and she's not planning to stay, so the effort isn't worth it.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's frustration and the mother's justification. The daughter might be in the right if her motivation is to help her parents integrate, but her approach (getting annoyed and making a passive-aggressive comment) could be seen as harsh. The mother's reasons are valid\u2014if she's not staying, why learn the language? Also, being a mother and prioritizing family might be a legitimate reason she can't focus on learning English now.\n\nI should consider cultural factors too. The mother might come from a different country where English isn't the primary language. Her stance could reflect a belief that her roots are more important than adapting to the new country. The daughter's frustration could stem from wanting to bridge the communication gap for better family dynamics, but the method of confrontation might not be the best approach.\n\nThe argument escalated quickly. The daughter's comment about the prophet's teachings contradicts the mother's current stance, leading to a harsh reaction. The mother's calling the daughter an animal and invalidating her arguments suggests a breakdown in communication. The daughter's final remark about old age being unreasonable was probably meant to provoke, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties have valid points. The daughter's intention to encourage education is noble, but her delivery and the resulting argument might not have been constructive. The mother's reasons for not learning are personal and possibly valid, but dismissing the daughter's concerns and reacting with anger isn't helpful either.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The daughter's annoyance isn't inherently wrong, but the way she expressed it and the resulting argument could have been handled better. The mother's refusal to learn might be a personal choice, but her reaction was defensive and harsh. It's a mutual issue, but the question is specifically about the daughter's responsibility. Since the daughter's frustration led to an argument and she made a cutting remark about old age, which is a sensitive topic, she might share some fault. However, the mother's defensiveness and harsh response also contributed. But the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. The daughter's annoyance isn't necessarily wrong, but her approach and the escalating conflict might make her at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the daughter's initial intention is reasonable, but the conflict's escalation complicates it. However, considering the daughter's dismissive comment about old age was likely an overreaction, which could tip the scales. But the main question is whether she's in the wrong for being annoyed and encouraging her mother. Since the mother has valid reasons for not learning, the daughter's annoyance might be a misunderstanding. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the daughter's intention to encourage education is valid, but the execution was poor. However, the mother's response was also inappropriate. But the question is about the daughter's side. The daughter isn't in the wrong for being annoyed, but the way she handled it could be better. Since the question asks if she's in the wrong, maybe the answer is B because the daughter's annoyance isn't inherently wrong, even if the argument was mishandled.\n"
