You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being annoyed that their mom hasn't learned the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author made a comment about their parents not speaking English well, which led to an argument. The mom responded by saying she didn't see the need to learn the language since she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother with no time. She also mentions focusing on religion instead. The author counters with a religious teaching about the importance of knowledge, which angers the mom, leading to a shouting match.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's annoyance is based on the idea that living in a country for 20 years should come with learning the language. But the mom has her reasons: she doesn't plan to stay, she's a mother, she's an \"old woman,\" and she's focusing on religion. \n\nIs the author wrong for encouraging education? Maybe not in intent, but the way it was delivered might be an issue. The comment was made in passing but escalated into a big argument. The author might have been dismissive of their mom's reasons. The mom's response about not wanting to waste time and the author bringing up a religious teaching that contradicts her current stance could have been the trigger. \n\nAlso, the author's final comment about \"being unreasonable comes with old age\" is probably hurtful. Even if the mom's reasoning is flawed, the way the author expressed their frustration might have been harsh. The key here is whether the author's annoyance was justified. While the mom's lack of effort might be frustrating, the argument escalated due to the author's approach. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling annoyed, but their reaction and the way they handled the conversation could have contributed to the conflict. However, the question is if they're \"in the wrong\" for being annoyed and encouraging education. The answer might hinge on whether the author's approach was reasonable. Since the mom has her own reasons and the author's response was confrontational, the author might share some responsibility. But I'm not sure if they're entirely wrong. Hmm.\n"
