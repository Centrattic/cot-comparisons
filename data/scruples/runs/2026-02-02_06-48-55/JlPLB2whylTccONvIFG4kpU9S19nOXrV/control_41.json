You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language of the country where she's lived for 20 years. \n\nFirst, the author is 19 and got into an argument with their mom. The mom and dad can barely speak English despite living in England for two decades. The author's comment about them not learning led to an argument. The mom's reasons are that she plans to stay there only temporarily and that she's a mother with no time, plus she's an \"old woman\" who wants to focus on religion. The author is frustrated because the mom used to emphasize the importance of knowledge and education.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, encouraging someone to learn the local language can be seen as reasonable, especially if it helps them integrate and function better in the country. But the author's tone and the fact that it escalated into an argument might be an issue. The mom has her own reasons, like not staying long and lack of time. The author might be right to want their parents to adapt, but maybe their approach was confrontational. The mom's response was harsh, calling the author an animal and dismissing their arguments. However, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut in terms of blame, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting their mom to learn English. However, the way they approached it might have contributed to the conflict. The mom's reasons are valid too. The author's last comment about old age being unreasonable might have been a bit harsh. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
