You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a daughter getting annoyed at her mom for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years.\n\nFirst, the daughter made a comment about her parents not speaking English well. The mom responds by saying she doesn't want to invest time in learning because she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother. The daughter then brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable. The mom gets angry, calls her an animal, and the daughter retorts about old age.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nHmm. The daughter's intention was to encourage her mom to learn, but the way she approached it led to an argument. The mom's response was defensive and disrespectful. However, the daughter's frustration might be valid if she feels her mom's unwillingness is causing problems. But the way she expressed that frustration, especially in an argument, could be seen as harsh.\n\nBut is the daughter in the wrong? The mom had a valid reason (not staying long, being a mother). The daughter's comment in passing turned into a big argument. The daughter's final words about old age might be disrespectful, but the initial frustration could be justified if the mom's lack of language skills is causing issues. However, the daughter's approach might have been too confrontational.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the daughter's intention is good, but her method was poor. The mom's defensiveness is also problematic. But the question is whether the author (the daughter) is in the wrong. The daughter's annoyance isn't inherently wrong, but how she handled it. The answer might hinge on whether the daughter's approach was reasonable. Since the daughter was trying to encourage learning, which is a positive goal, but the argument escalated. However, the mother's response was unkind. The daughter's part in provoking the argument might make her partially at fault, but maybe not entirely wrong. \n\nThe user said the author is in the wrong, but perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the daughter had a valid point, though the manner was bad. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just the approach. The daughter's frustration isn't wrong, but maybe the way she expressed it. However, in terms of moral wrong, since the daughter was trying to encourage education and the mother's response was worse, maybe the daughter isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
