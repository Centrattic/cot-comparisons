You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, their mum is 47. They had an argument because the author commented on their parents not speaking English well after 20 years. The mum responds by saying she doesn't want to invest time in learning the language since she doesn't plan to stay in the country long-term and she's a mother without time. She also mentions focusing on religion instead. The author brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable, and the mum gets angry, calls the author an animal, and the author retorts about old age.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for encouraging their mum to learn the language and being annoyed at her unwillingness. \n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the mum has lived there 20 years but hasn't learned the language. The author feels it's important for them to integrate, especially since the mum is complaining about not being able to navigate the country. The author's frustration might stem from wanting their parents to have better opportunities or to avoid relying on the author for communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the mum's reasons: she doesn't plan to stay long, she's a mother with no time, and she prioritizes religion. She might feel that her efforts are already sufficient or that her presence in the country isn't a priority. Also, her reaction was harsh, calling the author an animal, which is not acceptable. The author's comment about old age might have been a bit harsh too, but it's a reaction to being insulted.\n\nCultural context could matter here. If the family is from a different country and the mum is part of an immigrant community, maybe there's pressure to maintain the native language and culture, making the transition to English less of a priority. Additionally, the mum might not have had the opportunity or resources to learn English properly in the first place.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if they feel their mum's lack of English is causing problems. However, the way the argument escalated might be the issue. The author could have approached it more constructively instead of making accusatory comments. But the mum's response was clearly inappropriate, especially calling the author an animal.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting their mum to improve her language skills if that helps her integrate and solve problems. However, the annoyance itself isn't the issue. The problem might be the approach taken. The mum's refusal to learn and her harsh response make her partly at fault. The author's final comment about old age was probably not the best, but it's a reaction after being insulted.\n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing frustration. The mum's behavior and reasons are more questionable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
