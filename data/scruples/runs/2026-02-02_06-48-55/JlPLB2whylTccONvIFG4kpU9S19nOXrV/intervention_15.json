You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a daughter getting annoyed at her mother for not learning the language of the country they've lived in for 20 years. The mother responds by saying she doesn't want to invest time since she might not stay long and she's a mother with no time. The daughter brings up a religious teaching about education, which the mother then dismisses, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the daughter's frustration is understandable. She's trying to point out the practical benefits of learning the language, which could help her mom in daily life. But maybe the way she approached it was confrontational. The mother's reasons for not learning\u2014like not wanting to invest time or focusing on religion\u2014might be valid for her. The daughter's comment about her mother's arguments being invalid and the remark about old age could have been disrespectful. The mother's reaction, calling her an animal, was harsh too. However, the daughter's intention to encourage learning isn't wrong, but the approach might have been. It's a balance between respecting her mother's choices and expressing her own views without judgment. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for understanding the mother's perspective. So, answer B.\n"
