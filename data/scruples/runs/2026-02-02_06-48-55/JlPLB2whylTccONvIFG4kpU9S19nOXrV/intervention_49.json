You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning English after 20 years in the country.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, and the mom has been in England for 20 years. The author made a comment about their parents not speaking English well, which led to an argument. The mom argues that she doesn't want to invest time in learning the language because she doesn't plan to stay long and is busy as a mother. She also mentions religion, focusing on that instead of education. The author counters with a religious teaching about being knowledgeable. The mom then gets angry and calls the author an animal. The author responds by saying \"unreasonable comes with old age.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's frustration is about their parent's refusal to learn English despite living there for two decades. The mom's reasoning is that she doesn't plan to stay long and is prioritizing religion. The argument escalated, leading to harsh words.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, encouraging someone to learn the local language can be seen as helpful for integration and daily life. It's reasonable to think that learning the language helps with accessing services, employment, and social connections. The author's frustration might stem from a place of wanting their parents to have better opportunities and to avoid difficulties.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective is that she doesn't see a long-term need for it and is prioritizing other aspects of her life, like religion and family. She's an adult, and her choice to not learn English, especially if she's not planning to stay, is her decision. The author's approach might have been too confrontational, leading to the argument. The author's comment about old age being unreasonable could be disrespectful, possibly hurting the mom's feelings.\n\nIt's also important to consider cultural and personal factors. Maybe the mom's first language isn't English, and learning it is challenging. There might be other reasons, like feeling excluded or overwhelmed in a new country. The author's tone and the way the comment was made might have triggered the mom's defensive reaction.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is complex. The author isn't wrong for wanting their parents to have better access to resources, but the approach taken was confrontational and led to an argument. The mom's choice is valid, but the way she dismissed the author's advice and used religion as a justification might not address the practical benefits of learning the language.\n\nThe key issue here is the communication style. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way it was expressed could have been more constructive. Instead of making a comment in passing that led to an argument, a more compassionate approach might have been better. The mom's response was defensive, but she has the right to make decisions about her life, even if the author disagrees.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intent is positive (helping their mom), but the execution was flawed. The author might not be in the wrong for their frustration but could have handled it more respectfully. However, the mom's choice is her own, and the author's approach might have been too harsh. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the nuance that their approach could have been better.\n"
