You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mother for not learning the language after living in the country for 20 years. The situation involves a heated argument.\n\nFirst, the author comments on their parents' limited English, which leads to an argument. The mother responds by saying she doesn't see the need to learn since she might not stay long and she's a mother with no time. The author then brings up her mother's previous teachings about the importance of knowledge. The mother calls the author an animal, and the author makes a sarcastic remark about old age.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to encourage their mother to adapt, which is reasonable. On the other, the mother has her own reasons for not learning, like not planning to stay and being busy. The author's tone might have been harsh, contributing to the conflict. The mother's response was also hostile. \n\nThe key points are the author's frustration vs. the mother's reasons. The author's comment about old age could be seen as dismissive. Maybe the author is right to want their mother to improve, but the approach might be wrong. However, the mother's unwillingness and the clash in their conversation led to the argument. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong, but neither is the mother. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author expressed annoyance and made a cutting remark, perhaps they are partially at fault. But the mother's behavior was also inappropriate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has valid concerns, but their approach was problematic. But maybe it's more nuanced. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the right for encouraging learning, and the mother's refusal is the issue. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, but need to decide.\n"
