You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe user is a 19-year-old woman who had an argument with her mother, who's 47. The argument started when the user made a comment about her parents not speaking English well despite living in England for 20 years. The mother was complaining about how it's easier for people in England who speak English to get things done, and the user responded by saying maybe if her parents had learned the language and customs, they could handle their problems too. The mother then explained that she doesn't see a need to learn the language because she doesn't plan to stay in the country long-term and is too busy being a mother. Plus, she mentioned that she's an old woman and wants to focus on religion. The user then brings up a religious teaching that encourages people to be knowledgeable in their lands, leading to the mother calling her an animal and the user retorting about old age. The user is now wondering if she's at fault for getting annoyed and encouraging her mom to learn.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother has been in the country for 20 years but isn't speaking the language. The daughter is trying to encourage her to learn, but the mother resists, citing reasons like not wanting to stay long and being too busy. The daughter feels frustrated because the mother is not making an effort, especially since there's a religious teaching that supports learning about one's environment.\n\nIs the daughter in the wrong? Well, she's clearly concerned about her mother's integration and ability to navigate the country. But she's also a teenager, and sometimes their impatience can come across as judgmental. The mother, on the other hand, is in her 40s, and maybe the language barrier is a significant challenge. She might be facing other obstacles, like cultural differences or perhaps even feelings of displacement. Her argument that she doesn't plan to stay long might be valid if her current situation is temporary. Also, the mother could feel that the daughter isn't considering her priorities and life choices.\n\nThe daughter's frustration is understandable, but the way the argument escalated might be a problem. She made a comment that turned into a heated argument, and the mother felt attacked. The daughter mentioned the mother's previous teachings about knowledge, which the mother then dismissed, leading to a conflict. The daughter's final remark about old age could be seen as disrespectful, which might have contributed to the mother's anger.\n\nIt's also important to consider the mother's perspective. If she doesn't see the need to learn the language, maybe she has valid reasons. Perhaps she's part of a community where her native language is sufficient, or maybe she's facing other stressors. The daughter's approach might have been too confrontational, making the mother defensive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The daughter's intentions are good, but her method might have been harsh. The mother's resistance could stem from practical reasons or personal choices. Neither side is entirely wrong, but the daughter might have overstepped by being judgmental and not respecting her mother's choices. However, the mother's response of calling the daughter an animal and dismissing her arguments is also problematic.\n\nSo, considering the context, I think the daughter isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to encourage her mother, but her approach and the resulting harsh words might have been unnecessary. The mother's reaction was also excessive. But since the question is whether the author (the daughter) is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because her frustration is based on a genuine concern, even if her method could have been better. However, the way she handled it might have contributed to the conflict. But the options are A for yes (she's wrong) or B for no. I think the best answer is B, she's not in the wrong, because she's trying to encourage education and integration, which is a valid stance, even if the execution could have been smoother.\n"
