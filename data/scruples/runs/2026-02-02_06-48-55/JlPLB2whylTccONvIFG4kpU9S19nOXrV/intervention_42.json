You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language after 20 years in the country. The author is 19 and had an argument with their 47-year-old mum. The mum and dad can barely speak English. The author's comment about them learning the language led to an argument.\n\nThe mum says she doesn't want to learn because she doesn't plan to stay long and is too busy as a mother. She also mentions she's an old woman and wants to focus on religion. The author brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable in the land they live. The mum gets angry, calls the author an animal, and the author says something about old age.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mum has been in the country 20 years but hasn't learned the language. The author is trying to encourage her, but the mum is resistant. The author got annoyed and said something cutting. The mum's reasons for not learning might be valid\u2014maybe she's a mother, busy, and not planning to stay. But the author thinks she should make an effort.\n\nIs the author wrong for being annoyed? Well, encouraging someone to improve themselves isn't wrong, but the way it was done might be. The author made a passive-aggressive comment that escalated into an argument. The mum felt criticized, which led to her defensive response. The author's last comment about old age might be harsh and disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. Living in a country for 20 years without learning the language can lead to difficulties. The mum's reasoning might be flawed\u2014she's in the country for 20 years, which is a long time, so the idea of not staying long doesn't add up. Also, the religious aspect the author mentioned could be a point, but the mum dismissed it, which might be an issue.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been confrontational. Starting a conversation about this in a casual comment that escalates into an argument isn't the best way. The author's comment about the mum's age and the harsh words (\"invalid\" arguments, \"unreasonable\") could be seen as blaming her age, which isn't fair. The mum's response was also harsh, calling the author an animal, which isn't okay either.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author has valid concerns but expressed them poorly, leading to conflict. The mum's reasons might be valid, but her resistance and the harsh reaction are not justified. However, the author's approach was flawed. Therefore, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because their frustration was expressed in a hurtful way, and they didn't consider their mum's reasons or approach the topic more constructively. Even if the underlying concern is valid, the manner in which it was presented contributes to the conflict.\n"
