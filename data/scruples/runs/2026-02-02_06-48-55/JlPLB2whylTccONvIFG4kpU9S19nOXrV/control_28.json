You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting annoyed with their mother for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. The situation involves a heated argument where the author criticized their mom for not trying to learn the language and customs, and the mom responded with excuses about not wanting to invest time and focusing on religion instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother has lived in the country for two decades. The daughter is trying to encourage her to learn the language to navigate daily life better. The mother's response is that she doesn't plan to stay long, she's a mother without time, and now she's old and prefers religion. \n\nOn one side, the daughter's frustration is understandable. Learning a language in a new country is important for integration and accessing services. It's reasonable to want family members to make efforts to adapt. The daughter might feel that her mother's lack of effort is affecting their interactions or practical situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother has lived there 20 years. Maybe she's comfortable in her community, uses other support systems, or has valid reasons for not wanting to learn more. The mother's age and perceived lack of time could be factors. Also, the daughter's approach might have been confrontational, leading to the argument. \n\nThe daughter's tone and choice of words could have been harsh, especially bringing up past teachings about education. The mom's defensive reaction, including calling her an animal, is not acceptable, but the daughter's frustration might be justified in wanting her mom to engage more.\n\nCultural factors matter here. If the family comes from a different country, there might be cultural resistance to assimilation. The mother might feel her identity is tied to her native language and culture, making her reluctant to change now.\n\nThe daughter's annoyance isn't unwarranted, but her method of expressing it might have been the problem. Encouragement versus criticism is key. Also, the mother's refusal to learn despite the daughter's efforts shows a lack of willingness, which is frustrating.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a two-way situation. However, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. Since she's advocating for something reasonable (language learning) and it's not illegal or harmful, her stance isn't wrong. The mother's excuses might not hold up, especially after 20 years. But the daughter's approach might need to be softer. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong, so considering the mother's excuses as invalid, the daughter isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
