You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after 20 years in the country.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author is 19, their mom is 47. The argument started because the author commented on their parents not speaking English well. The mom's response is that she doesn't plan to stay long and doesn't have time because she's a mother and an old woman, focusing on religion instead. The author then brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable, which the mom dismisses. The argument escalates, with the mom calling the author an animal and the author making a sarcastic remark about old age.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is frustrated with their mom's lack of effort to learn the language. The mom gives reasons for not doing so. The author feels the mom is being unreasonable, but the mom is defensive and dismissive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The author's frustration might be justified if they believe their parents' lack of language skills is causing problems (like difficulty with bureaucracy, social integration, etc.). However, the mom has her own reasons\u2014maybe she's in a country temporarily, has other priorities, or doesn't see the need. The author's approach was to confront the mom during an argument where she was already stressed. The author might have been right to express concern but did it in a way that led to a conflict. The mom's response was unkind, but the author's tone in the comment (\"Right. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\") shows a dismissive attitude towards the mom's reasons, which might have escalated the conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's final remark about old age being a factor in being unreasonable is probably not helpful. Even if the mom's reasons are flawed, the author could have approached the issue more respectfully. The question is whether the author's frustration is justified, but the way they handled it might have been wrong. On the other hand, the mom's refusal to engage in learning when the author is trying to help could also be seen as uncooperative. But the problem is more about the author's reaction than the mom's actions. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but their approach could have been better. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. The answer depends on cultural context too. In some cultures, family dynamics are different. But since the user is asking for a general perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not being more understanding of the mom's reasons, even if those reasons are not ideal. Or maybe they are not in the wrong because they have a valid concern. It's a bit tricky. The key is whether the author's annoyance is justified. The mom's reasons are given, but they might not be valid. The author has a right to express concern, but the way they did it led to a harsh argument. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to encourage their mom, but the execution was poor. However, some might say the author is in the wrong for being dismissive of the mom's reasons. I think it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting the mom to learn the language, but the way they handled the argument is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed. Since the author's frustration comes from a place of wanting to help, but the mom's reasons are not compelling (like if she's been there for 20 years and not planning to stay), maybe the author's annoyance is justified. But the mom's response was also poor. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to encourage learning, even if the argument was handled poorly. The main issue is the mom's refusal to engage, not the author's frustration. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
