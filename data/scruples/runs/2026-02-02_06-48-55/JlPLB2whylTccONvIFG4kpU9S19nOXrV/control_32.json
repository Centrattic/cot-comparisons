You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language of the country where she's lived for 20 years. The situation is that the author and their father can't speak the local language (English, as they live in England), and the author made a comment about that. The argument escalated when the mum said she doesn't want to learn because she thinks she won't stay there long and that she's too busy as a mother and wants to focus on religion instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mum has been living in England for 20 years. The user is 19, and the parents are likely immigrants. The author's frustration seems to stem from the parents' inability to navigate the country effectively, especially since they were complaining about others having an advantage because they speak English. The author's comment was about the importance of learning the language and customs, which is a reasonable point. However, the mum's response is that she doesn't see the need, given her plans to leave and her focus on family and religion. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's intention was to encourage their mum to learn, which is a valid perspective. However, the way the argument escalated might have been due to the mum's fixed mindset. The mum's refusal to learn could be based on her own priorities or perhaps a belief that she doesn't need to adapt fully. There might be cultural or personal reasons for her stance. The author's annoyance is understandable, but maybe the approach could have been more empathetic. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed and encouraging their mum. It's not about the approach here, but the fact that the author feels the mum should have learned the language. The mum's argument that she's an \"old woman\" and doesn't want to invest time might be a red flag. The author's comment about \"unreasonable comes with old age\" is a bit harsh, but the core issue is whether the expectation to learn the language is valid. \n\nIn many cases, integrating into a new country by learning the language is seen as important for daily life and opportunities. The mum's reasoning that she won't stay long is a counterpoint, but if she's been there 20 years, maybe her plans have changed. Also, as a mother, her ability to communicate could affect the family. However, the mum might feel pressured or not ready to change her focus. \n\nThe author isn't \"crazy\" for wanting their parents to learn English, especially if it helps them in the country they're living in. But the mum's unwillingness could be due to various factors, not just being unreasonable. The author's annoyance is a reaction to a long-standing issue, but the argument's escalation might have been due to communication styles. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting their mum to learn the language. The mum's response is dismissive, and the author's frustration is justified. The answer should be B for No.\n"
