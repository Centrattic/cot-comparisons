You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mother for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 19, the mother is 47. They had an argument after the daughter commented that her parents can't speak English well despite 20 years in the country. The daughter's comment was about the mother needing to put effort into learning the language to sort out problems. The mother responded that she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan to stay, she's a mother busy with family, and she's an old woman who just wants to focus on religion. The daughter then brought up a previous teaching about the Prophet emphasizing knowledge and education. The mother called her an animal and said her arguments were invalid. The daughter's last remark was about old age causing unreasonableness.\n\nThe question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the community's take. Answer A if yes, B if no.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The daughter's frustration is understandable; 20 years is a long time, and learning a language can improve integration. However, the mother has her own reasons: she doesn't plan to stay long, she's occupied with family, and she's focusing on religion. The daughter's approach was to point out the mother's lack of effort, which led to conflict. The key here is whether the daughter's reaction was reasonable.\n\nBut maybe the daughter's comment was made in passing, which escalated into an argument. The mother's response about not wanting to learn, and the daughter's bringing up past teachings might have been a trigger. The daughter's final remark about old age could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The mother's emotional response (calling her an animal) suggests that the daughter's comment hit a sensitive spot, possibly in a way that was hurtful or not constructive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the daughter wanted to encourage her mother, but the method might not have been appropriate. The mother's reasons, while perhaps not ideal, are valid from her perspective. The daughter's frustration is justified, but her approach might have been too confrontational. The question is whether being annoyed is in itself wrong, even if the underlying issue is valid. Also, the daughter's reaction of storming off and making a sarcastic comment might indicate that she handled it poorly.\n\nSo, considering the context, the daughter's annoyance is not entirely without merit, but her handling of the situation could be seen as contributing to the conflict. The mother's reasons for not learning English might be less than ideal, but that doesn't make the daughter's annoyance wrong per se. However, the way she expressed her frustration and the escalation of the argument might be where the fault lies. In some perspectives, pushing someone who has their own priorities, especially a parent, might not be the best approach. So the answer could be A (the daughter is in the wrong) because she handled it poorly, even if her intent was good. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) because the frustration is understandable.\n\nBut I need to check the cultural context too. The mother might be from a different culture where learning the language isn't a priority, especially if she doesn't plan to stay. The daughter's argument that the mother should learn the language because it's necessary for integration might be valid, but the mother's reasons are her own. The daughter's approach, however, was to challenge her mother's lifestyle choices, which could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the mother is set on her ways. The daughter's use of the Prophet's teaching against her mother also adds another layer of cultural sensitivity. Maybe the daughter's method was not respectful, leading to the mother's defensive reaction.\n\nSo, the daughter's annoyance is understandable, but the way she approached it, leading to an argument, might be where she's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
