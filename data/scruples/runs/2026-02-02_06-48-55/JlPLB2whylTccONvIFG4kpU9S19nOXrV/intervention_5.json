You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after 20 years in the country.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, and their mom has lived in the UK for 20 years but still struggles with English. The mom is 47 and claims she doesn't plan to stay long. The argument started when the author commented on their parents' lack of English skills, and the mom responded by saying it's not worth her time to learn since she's an old woman and a mother with no time. She also mentioned religion as her focus now.\n\nThe author is frustrated because their mom used to talk about a prophet's teaching that one should be knowledgeable in the country they live. The mom's sudden shift in attitude led to the argument. The author called the mom out for being unreasonable, leading to the mom calling them an animal and the author storming out.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author's frustration comes from wanting their mom to adapt, which is understandable. However, the mom's reasons for not learning the language are her own choices. She might have made a decision based on her circumstances (age, family duties, intentions to leave). The author's approach was confrontational, leading to an argument. While wanting to encourage education is good, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, especially in an argumentative context. The mom's response was defensive, but the author's comment about old age being unreasonable could be seen as dismissive of her position.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, wanting family members to adapt can be valid. On the other, the approach taken was confrontational and disrespectful, especially mentioning old age. The mom's reasons (time, age, not staying) are her own, and the author's frustration might be misplaced if the mom isn't in the UK to stay. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but their method of expressing it was inappropriate. So, the answer is a bit of both, but since the user wants A or B, leaning towards B since the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach was flawed. However, considering the context, maybe A because the author's reaction was harsh. Hmm, tricky. Maybe B because the author's intent was to encourage, but the execution was poor. The mom's reasons are valid, but the author's tone and the personal jab about old age could be seen as the main issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
