You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got into an argument with her mom because the mom hasn't learned English well after living in the UK for 20 years. The author was annoyed because the mom was complaining about difficulties in a country where they live, and the author suggested that learning the language would help. The mom responded by saying she doesn't want to learn because she doesn't plan to stay long and is focused on religion and family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's young, maybe just starting to think about the importance of language in integration. She sees her parents not making an effort, which frustrates her, especially since they've been there for two decades. She's trying to encourage them, but her mom is resistant. She mentions the mom used to talk about the importance of knowledge from a religious figure, which makes the mom's current stance a bit contradictory. The author's comment about old age and being unreasonable was probably meant to push back, but it might have been a harsh way to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective is that she doesn't want to invest time in learning a language if she's not staying. She's also a mother, which is a time-consuming role. She might have her own reasons, maybe cultural or personal, for not wanting to learn English. Her reaction was defensive, and she lashed out, calling the author an animal. That's not great, but the mom's position is that she's an old woman focusing on religion and family, and the author's comment about old age was a direct jab.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed and trying to encourage her mom. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way she expressed it led to a harsh argument. The mom's response was also unkind, but the author's final comment about old age was probably the trigger. The author might not be entirely wrong for feeling frustrated, but her approach might have been too confrontational. The mom's reasons, while perhaps not ideal, are her own choices. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe she overreacted in the argument. However, the core issue of wanting the mom to learn English isn't inherently wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances here. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for being so harsh. Hmm.\n"
