You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is between a daughter and her mom. The daughter is annoyed that her mom hasn't learned the language of the country they've lived in for 20 years. The mom says she doesn't have time, doesn't want to, and focuses on religion instead. The daughter got into an argument and called her mom out, leading to a fight. The daughter is wondering if she's in the wrong (ATA) for being annoyed and encouraging her mom to learn.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The daughter is frustrated because her mom is living in a country for two decades and hasn't made an effort to learn the language. The mom, on the other hand, has her reasons: she's a mother, doesn't have time, and isn't planning to stay long. She also mentions her age and focusing on religion. \n\nThe daughter points out that the mom used to talk about the importance of being knowledgeable and educated, which the mom now ignores. That might be a point where the daughter felt betrayed or hypocritical. But the mom's response was defensive, and the argument escalated. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the daughter's annoyance is justified. The mom's decision not to learn the language could be a personal choice. Maybe she's not interested, or maybe there are cultural or personal reasons. The daughter's frustration is understandable, especially if the mom is complaining about the country's systems (like getting services) if she can't communicate well. \n\nBut the daughter's approach might have been harsh. Calling the mom out in the way she did, especially leading to an argument and using a comment about old age, might have been unkind. The daughter might not be in the wrong entirely, but perhaps her method of addressing the issue was inappropriate. \n\nThe mom's argument about not wanting to invest time and not staying long could be valid. However, maybe the daughter has a point about not making an effort to adapt. But it's also possible that the mom has her own reasons and the daughter is overstepping by lecturing her. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the daughter isn't in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but her reaction was perhaps not the best. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong in general, maybe the answer is B (No), because she's not wrong for feeling that way, even if the argument was handled poorly. Alternatively, the mom's choice is her own, so the daughter is in the wrong to be annoyed. \n\nBut I need to think again. The daughter's argument is about encouraging her mom to educate herself, which is a valid concern. However, the mom's refusal is her choice. The daughter's annoyance might be justified, but the way she expressed it (storming off, calling her an animal, making a comment about old age) is inconsiderate. So perhaps she's not in the wrong for the annoyance, but her actions during the argument are. The question is whether she's in the wrong overall. \n\nThe original question is about whether she's in the wrong for getting annoyed and encouraging her mom. If the annoyance is not the wrong part, but the way she expressed it, the answer might still be B. But if the annoyance itself is considered wrong, then A. Considering that the daughter's concern is about her mom not adapting, which is a personal choice, but the daughter's frustration is a natural reaction to that choice. So maybe B (No).\n"
