You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed with their mom for not learning English after 20 years in the UK.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 19, and their mom is 47. The mom and dad live in England but have trouble with English. The author made a comment about them not trying to learn the language, which led to an argument. The mom argued she doesn't want to waste time learning English because she plans to leave soon and is busy with being a mother. Also, she doesn't want to focus on education, just religion now. The author was trying to encourage her to learn, citing a religious teaching about being knowledgeable.\n\nThe author is wondering if they were wrong to get annoyed. The user wants a yes or no answer (A or B). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The mom has lived there 20 years but hasn't learned English. The author feels she should make an effort. The mom's reasons: she doesn't plan to stay, she's a mother, she's old and wants to focus on religion. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's reasonable to want parents to integrate for practical reasons. But the mom might have her own reasons for not learning. The author got annoyed, which is a natural reaction, but is it justified? \n\nThe mom's arguments: maybe she comes from a culture where learning the new language isn't a priority, or she expects to return to her home country. She might also feel that her efforts are not being recognized, or maybe there's some resentment towards the daughter's judgment. The author's comment about her arguments being invalid could have been hurtful. \n\nBut the author's intention to encourage learning isn't wrong. However, the way the conversation escalated into an argument might be where the author could be at fault. Maybe the author was confrontational or didn't consider the mom's perspective. On the other hand, the mom dismissing the author's valid points (especially the religious teaching) could be her fault. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author was in the wrong for getting annoyed. The author's frustration is understandable, but the mom's unwillingness might stem from valid personal reasons. The author's response of mocking her age (\"they say being unreasonable comes with old age\") could be seen as dismissive and hurtful, which might make the author partly at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. If the author's annoyance is about the mom not making an effort when it's important for daily life, maybe not. However, the way the argument escalated might be where the author went overboard. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author isn't wrong to feel frustrated, but maybe the approach was poor. However, the core issue is the mom's unwillingness. So the author isn't in the wrong for getting annoyed, but maybe could have handled it better. The answer is B.\n"
