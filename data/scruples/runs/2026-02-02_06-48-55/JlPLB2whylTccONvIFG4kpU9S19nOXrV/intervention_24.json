You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the daughter getting annoyed with her mom for not learning English after living in the UK for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's frustrated that her parents aren't making an effort to learn the language despite their long stay. She argues that if they did, they'd be able to navigate their problems better. That seems reasonable on the surface because integrating into a new country often involves learning the language for practical reasons like communication and accessing services.\n\nBut then there's the mom's side. She mentions she doesn't plan to stay in the UK long and doesn't have time as a mother. She also says she's an old woman and wants to focus on religion instead of education. This suggests she has her own reasons for not learning English, which might be based on her priorities and life circumstances. Plus, there's a cultural aspect here\u2014maybe she's from a country where English isn't widely spoken, and she hasn't seen a need to learn it if she's planning to return.\n\nThe daughter brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable. The mom then gets angry and calls her an animal, which indicates a breakdown in communication. The daughter's last comment about old age being unreasonable could have been hurtful, even if she felt justified.\n\nNow, considering whether the daughter is in the wrong. She's expressing frustration, which is a valid emotion, but how she expressed it might be the issue. Criticizing a parent's life choices, especially in a condescending way, can come off as disrespectful. The mom's reasons for not learning English might be personal and valid, and the daughter dismissing those reasons as nonsensical could be where she goes wrong. Also, the argument escalated because of the daughter's comment about old age, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is trying to encourage her mother to adapt for practical benefits, which is a common concern in immigrant families. However, the approach matters. Instead of getting annoyed and making it a confrontation, she might have approached it with more empathy, trying to understand her mother's perspective first.\n\nThe key points here are respect, empathy, and communication. The daughter's frustration is understandable, but the way she handled the situation could be seen as dismissive of her mother's reasons. The mom's response was also harsh, but the daughter's comment about old age was likely hurtful. So, while both might have contributed to the conflict, the daughter's actions in the argument might place her in the wrong.\n"
