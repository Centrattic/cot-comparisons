You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the local language after 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 19, their mom is 47. The mom and dad can't speak English well. The author made a comment, which led to an argument. The mom's response was that she doesn't plan to stay long, she's a mother with no time, and now she just wants religion. The author was trying to encourage learning, which the mom took as criticism.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being annoyed. Let's break down the factors. On one hand, the author is trying to help their mom adapt, which is reasonable. Learning the local language is important for integration. But the mom has her reasons: she doesn't plan to stay, feels she's too old, and has family responsibilities. She also used to emphasize education in religion, which is conflicting now.\n\nThe argument escalated, the mom called the author an animal, and the author made a sarcastic comment about old age. The key points are the validity of the author's frustration versus the mom's rights to decide how to spend her time. \n\nPossible angles: The author's intention is good, but maybe the approach was harsh. The mom's reasons might be valid too, especially if she's not staying. However, the mom's response was hostile and dismissive. The author's annoyance is due to a desire to help, but the argument handling could be better. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force the mom to learn; they expressed their opinion, which led to conflict. But the mom's refusal and the argument's escalation might not place the blame entirely on the author. However, the author's comment about old age could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIn AITA situations, both sides often have some fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The mom's behavior was worse (shouting, calling names), but the initial annoyance from the author is about a reasonable point. So the author's annoyance isn't entirely wrong, but their reaction might have been part of the problem. However, the main issue is the mom's refusal to engage. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid concern, but the way the argument escalated is more on the mom's part. The author's frustration is justified, but their approach could be discussed. Still, the core issue is the mom's unwillingness without a clear reason. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
