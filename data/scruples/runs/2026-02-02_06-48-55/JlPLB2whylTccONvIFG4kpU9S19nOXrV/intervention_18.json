You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after 20 years. The situation involves the mom not making an effort to learn English, and the author is frustrated with that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 19, and the mom has been in the country for 20 years. Making a comment about their English skills might be seen as harsh, especially if the mom is struggling. The mom's reasons for not learning include not wanting to waste time, being a mother, and not planning to stay long. She also mentions age and focusing on religion instead. \n\nThe author is trying to encourage education, which is valid, but the way it was communicated led to an argument. The mom felt attacked, leading to a defensive reaction. The author's comment about old age and being unreasonable might have been the final straw. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting family members to learn the language can be valid for integration, but the approach matters. The author's frustration is understandable, but the confrontation might not have been handled well. The mom's reasons, while maybe not ideal, are her personal choices. The author's comment could come off as judgmental, especially given the mom's age and other responsibilities. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's response of calling the author an animal is clearly wrong. But the question is about the author's fault. The author's annoyance isn't inherently wrong, but the way they expressed it and escalated the argument might be. The author might have a point in encouraging education, but the method and timing were poor. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it better. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the context, the author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it led to conflict. So maybe the answer is B (no), as the author's intentions aren't wrong, even if the execution could be better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author's annoyance is a reaction to the mom's choices, it's not their fault. So answer B.\n"
