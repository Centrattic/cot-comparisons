You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between a daughter and her mother. The daughter is 19, and the mother has been living in England for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The daughter got annoyed and told her mother that if she tried to learn the language, she could sort her problems out. The mother responded by saying she doesn't want to learn because she doesn't plan to stay long and as a mother she's busy. She also mentioned focusing on religion instead. The daughter then pointed out the mother used to preach about the importance of knowledge, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's trying to encourage her mother to learn the language, which could help her integrate better and solve problems. It's reasonable to want to help a parent who's struggling. But the mother's response is that she doesn't see the point because she's not staying and is too busy. Also, she's older, 47, so maybe she's not in the best position to start learning a new language now. The daughter got annoyed and called her an animal, which is pretty harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother has been living there for 20 years and hasn't made an effort. The daughter's frustration is understandable, but the way she expressed it might have been too confrontational. The mother's reasons\u2014lack of time, not staying, focusing on religion\u2014might not be valid, but they're her choices. The daughter could have approached it more compassionately instead of getting angry.\n\nAlso, the mother's reaction was to shout and call the daughter an animal, which is not okay. But the daughter's comment about old age being unreasonable is also hurtful. Both sides said things they shouldn't have. The key here is whether the daughter is in the wrong for being annoyed. Her annoyance is justified because the mother isn't making an effort, but the way she handled it could be better. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. The mother's behavior is also problematic, but the daughter's intention was to encourage, even if the method was flawed.\n\nSo, is the daughter in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. Her frustration is valid, but her approach led to a harsh argument. However, the mother's response was equally bad. The answer might be B (No) because the daughter isn't wrong for wanting to encourage her mother, even if the execution was poor. The mother's refusal without good reason is also part of the issue. But some might argue the daughter should have been more patient. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the daughter isn't in the wrong for wanting her mother to learn, even if the argument escalated.\n"
