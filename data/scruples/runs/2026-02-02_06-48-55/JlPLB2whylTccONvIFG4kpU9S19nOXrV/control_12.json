You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 19 and had an argument with their mom, who's 47. The mom has been living in a country where they speak English for 20 years but doesn't speak it well. The author commented on this, leading to a big fight.\n\nFirst, the author's point is that the mom isn't trying to learn the language, which is important for living there. The mom responds that she doesn't stay long, doesn't have time because she's a mother and old, and prefers to focus on religion. The author feels frustrated because the mom used to emphasize education from a prophet, so they're confused why she's resisting now.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for getting annoyed? Well, the author's intention was to encourage their mom to learn, which seems reasonable. But maybe they approached it the wrong way. The mom might feel criticized, especially if she's facing challenges learning a new language later in life or if she's not planning to stay. Also, the author called her an animal and made a comment about old age, which is probably not helpful. The mom might have felt disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom isn't making an effort to learn, which could affect her daily life and integration. The author's frustration might stem from a desire to help, but the way they expressed it led to a harsh argument. The mom's reasons\u2014like not staying long and being busy\u2014might be valid. However, that doesn't mean the author is wrong for wanting her to at least try. \n\nIt's a complex situation where both sides have points. The author's annoyance is understandable, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author was trying to encourage learning, which is a good goal, but the method led to conflict, maybe they're not entirely wrong. The mom's defensiveness and the author's tone both contributed. So, probably, the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the nuance that communication could improve.\n"
