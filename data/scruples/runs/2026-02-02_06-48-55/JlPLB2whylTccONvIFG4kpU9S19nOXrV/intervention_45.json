You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after getting annoyed at their mom for not learning English after 20 years in the country. The scenario involves an argument where the author criticizes their mom for not putting effort into learning the language, and the mom responds with reasons like not wanting to invest time and focusing on religion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 19, and their mom is 47. The author is frustrated that their parents don't speak English well, leading to problems. The mom's reasons include not planning to stay long and being busy as a mother. The author is trying to encourage her to learn, which might be seen as valid, but the way the argument escalated could be an issue.\n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable, but maybe the approach taken was too harsh. The mom is an adult, and her reasons for not learning English might be personal choices. The author's comment about the prophet's teachings suggests the mom had previously emphasized the importance of education, which the author is pointing out as a contradiction. However, calling the mom an animal and making a snide remark about old age might have been uncalled for, even if the frustration is there.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's response was dismissive and possibly disrespectful when she called the author an animal. But the author's initial frustration could be justified if they feel the mom's lack of effort is causing issues. The key here is whether the author's annoyance was proportionate and if their approach was respectful.\n\nThe author might be in the right in wanting to encourage their mother to learn, but the manner in which it was done might have been wrong. However, the mom's response was also disrespectful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was trying to express concern and was met with hostility, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But their final remark about old age could be seen as rude, which might tip the scales. However, the mom's argument about not wanting to invest time might not be a valid excuse, so the author's frustration is valid. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were expressing a valid concern, albeit poorly.\n"
