You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after 20 years in the country. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that her mom, who has lived in an English-speaking country for two decades, isn't making an effort to learn the language. The author sees this as a problem, especially since her mom is complaining about difficulties. The mom argues she doesn't see the need because she doesn't plan to stay long and is busy being a mother. She also mentions focusing on religion instead.\n\nNow, the key points here. The mom has been there 20 years. Is it reasonable to expect a parent to learn the language? Well, language acquisition can be hard, especially for adults, and there might be various barriers\u2014like if she's not in an environment that requires it, or if there's a lack of resources. Also, the mom's excuse about not staying long might be a reason not to invest time. But the author is upset because she feels the mom could improve her life by learning English.\n\nThen there's the argument about religion and education. The mom once cited a prophet's advice about being knowledgeable but now says she doesn't want to. That inconsistency is a point the author brings up. The mom's reaction was harsh, calling the author an animal, which seems like an overreaction. The author's frustration is understandable, given the mom's resistance to learning despite the long time there.\n\nBut the author's approach might have contributed. Starting with a comment in passing that escalated into an argument suggests that the way the topic was brought up might not have been the best. The author's final remark about old age being unreasonable could be seen as disrespectful, even if it's a common stereotype. That might have been a low blow, adding to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's excuses\u2014like not having time as a mother and not planning to stay\u2014might be valid. However, she's been there 20 years. If she's there for two decades, the initial plan to not stay long might have changed, or maybe she's stayed longer than intended. The mom's unwillingness to adapt could be seen as problematic, especially if it's affecting her ability to navigate daily life.\n\nCultural factors also play a role. If the family comes from a different country, there could be cultural resistance to changing their ways. The author's frustration is about the mom not trying to integrate, which is a common issue in immigrant families.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a point in encouraging her mom to learn the language if she's living there long-term. However, the way the argument escalated, and the author's harsh words at the end, might indicate that she could have handled it more maturely. The mom's reaction was also aggressive, which is not okay, but the author's comment about old age could have been hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for feeling frustrated, but her approach might not have been the best. The mom's excuses are weak given the 20 years, but her reaction was inappropriate. The answer might lean towards B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the core issue is the mom's lack of effort in a country she's lived in for two decades. However, the author's methods could be questioned. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was trying to encourage her mom and got upset over valid concerns, the answer is B.\n"
