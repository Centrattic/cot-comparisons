You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after 20 years in the country. The mom has lived in England, where English is the main language, for two decades. The daughter is 19 and got into an argument when she criticized her mom for not making an effort to learn English. The mom's response was that she doesn't plan to stay long, doesn't want to get educated, and focuses on religion instead. The daughter then reminded her of a religious teaching about being knowledgeable. The mom got angry and called her an animal.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess whether the daughter was wrong. The key points here are the mom's right to choose her priorities and the daughter's right to express her opinion. The daughter is frustrated because her mother isn't learning the language in a country where that would help. However, the mom might feel that learning English isn't necessary for her, especially if she doesn't plan to stay. Also, the mom's argument about not having time as a mother could be valid. \n\nCulturally, there's a difference between the daughter's perspective (valuing education and integration) and the mom's (prioritizing religion and not wanting to invest time). The daughter might feel it's important for her parents to integrate, but the mom has her own reasons for not doing so. \n\nThe argument escalated because the daughter criticized her mom's choice, which might have been seen as dismissive of her mother's priorities. The mom's response was defensive, leading to a shouting match. The daughter's comment about old age being unreasonable might have been a mistake in terms of escalating the conflict, even if she felt wronged.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The daughter isn't entirely wrong for wanting her mom to learn the language, but her frustration was expressed in a way that might have been hurtful. The mom's reasons for not learning might be valid, but the way she dismissed her daughter's concerns could be seen as dismissive as well. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author (daughter) is in the wrong for being annoyed. The daughter's annoyance stems from a place of wanting her mom to integrate, which is a reasonable desire. But the way she expressed it led to an argument. The mom's refusal to learn could be due to personal choices, and the daughter's frustration might be justified, but the confrontation could have been handled better.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the daughter isn't in the wrong for being annoyed, but perhaps she could have approached it differently. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
