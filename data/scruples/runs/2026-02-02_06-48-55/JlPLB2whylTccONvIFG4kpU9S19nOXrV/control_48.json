You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 19, and their mom is 47. They had an argument where the author criticized the mom for not learning English. The mom's reasons are that she doesn't plan to stay in the country long, she's busy as a mother, and she wants to focus on religion. The author found those reasons not valid and got annoyed.\n\nNow, the key points here are the mom's reasons for not learning the language. The mom is an immigrant who's been there 20 years. The author is frustrated that she's not making an effort. But the mom feels she doesn't need to because she's not staying, she's busy, and she's older. \n\nI need to consider cultural and generational factors. Maybe the mom's country of origin has a different attitude towards learning a new language. Also, being a mother with responsibilities might limit her time. The mom's age could be a factor too\u2014learning a new language is harder as you get older. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially if the mom is complaining about not being able to navigate the country. But the author's approach of criticizing her in a way that led to an argument might have been harsh. The mom felt judged, and the argument escalated. \n\nThe author's last comment about old age being unreasonable might have been a bit much. Even if the author is concerned, the way they expressed it could have been more respectful. However, the mom's refusal to engage and the argument itself started with the mom's own complaints. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong for expressing frustration, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the mom's reasons for not learning the language are personal and valid for her. The author's annoyance is about the mom not trying, but the mom has her own priorities. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
