You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 19-year-old girl who got into an argument with her mother because the mom hasn't learned the English language well after living in the UK for 20 years. The author was annoyed and pushed her mom to learn the language and customs, but the mom didn't want to and gave reasons like not wanting to waste time since she might not stay, being a mother, and focusing on religion instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being annoyed and encouraging her mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to encourage her mom to learn the language, which is a reasonable expectation if someone lives in a country for a long time. However, the mom has her own reasons for not learning. The author brings up a religious teaching that the Prophet said people should be knowledgeable in the lands they live in. The mom then yells and calls the author an animal. The author responds with a sarcastic comment about old age.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is trying to help, but her approach might have been condescending or dismissive of her mom's reasons. The mom's reasons include not wanting to invest time if she's leaving, being busy as a mother, and focusing on religion. The author used a religious argument against the mom's stance, which might have been a trigger. The mom's reaction is defensive and hostile, which led to the argument escalating.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, pointing out that learning the language can be beneficial isn't inherently wrong. But how it's delivered matters. The author's frustration might be justified, but her approach could be seen as disrespectful, especially bringing up religious teachings to counter her mom's personal choices. The mom might feel criticized for her life choices, and the author didn't consider her mom's perspective or reasons. The argument escalated because of the tone and the use of religious points, which could be seen as weaponizing beliefs against her mom.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's refusal to learn the language despite living there for 20 years might be frustrating for the daughter, who sees it as a way to improve her life. But the daughter's method might not be the best approach. The author might have a valid point about the benefits of learning the language, but her delivery and the condescension in pointing out her mom's shortcomings likely made the situation worse. The mom's defensive reaction is understandable if she feels her choices are being invalidated.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's intent was good, but her execution was poor. She didn't approach it with empathy and instead used criticism that triggered the mom's defensiveness. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility in how the argument escalated. However, the mom's refusal to engage constructively also plays a role. But the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's approach was confrontational and dismissive of her mom's reasons, she might be partly at fault. But the mom's reaction was also extreme. It's a nuanced situation. However, the author's main \"wrong\" might be in how she expressed her concerns rather than the concern itself. So, maybe the answer is that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but her approach could have been better. But the user is asking for A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong), because the author's intent was to help, but maybe the delivery was the issue. However, in AITA cases, sometimes the person is considered in the wrong if their approach was unhelpful. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because it's reasonable to want someone to learn the language, but the method could be better. Since the options are A or B, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
