You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the daughter getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's 19 and maybe feels frustrated because her parents, who have lived in the UK for 20 years, still can't speak English well. She's trying to encourage her mom to learn the language and customs to better navigate their new country. She points out that her mom uses the excuse of not wanting to invest time since she's an \"old woman\" and focuses on religion instead. The daughter also mentions that her mom used to preach the importance of knowledge, which adds to the daughter's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is 47 and may have reasons for not learning English. Maybe she's not motivated because she doesn't plan to stay in the UK long-term. Also, she's a mother, so time constraints could be a real issue. She might feel that her age or priorities (like religion) make learning English less important now. The mom's reaction was harsh, calling the daughter an animal and dismissing her arguments, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe daughter's approach was to make a comment in passing, which escalated into an argument. She might not have considered her mom's feelings or the reasons behind her reluctance. The daughter's final remark about old age being unreasonable could have been hurtful. While the daughter's intentions are to help, her method of expressing frustration might have been inappropriate.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The daughter wants her mom to improve, but her approach led to a conflict. The mom's excuses might not be valid, but the daughter's response was also harsh. Both have valid points, but the daughter's judgmental attitude and the way she escalated the argument could be seen as wrong. The mom's dismissiveness and excuses aren't great either, but the question is about the daughter's actions. Since the daughter was in the role of challenging her mom's choices and did so in a way that led to an argument, maybe she's partly at fault. However, if the mom is resistant to learning, the daughter's frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the daughter had the right to be annoyed. The daughter isn't wrong for wanting her mom to learn, but her approach might have been wrong. The final answer depends on balancing both sides. The daughter's motivation is good, but the way she handled it could be better. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps she could have approached it differently. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The mom's excuses are weak, but the daughter's harshness is a problem. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
