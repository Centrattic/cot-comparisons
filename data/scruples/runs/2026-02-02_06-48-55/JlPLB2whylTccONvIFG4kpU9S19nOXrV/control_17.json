You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning the language of the country she's lived in for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 19, and her mom is 47. The argument started when the author commented on her parents' lack of English proficiency. The mom responded by saying she doesn't need to learn the language because she doesn't plan to stay in the country long. She also mentioned not having time as a mother and wanting to focus on religion instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's reasons for not learning the language. The author is frustrated because her mom has been there for 20 years and could benefit from knowing the language. But the mom has her own reasons: she doesn't plan to stay, she's busy as a mother, and she wants to focus on religion. \n\nI need to consider if the author's annoyance is justified. The author is trying to encourage her mother to learn English to help her navigate the country better. But the mother has her own priorities and reasons for not doing so. The author might not realize that the mother's decision is based on her own circumstances. \n\nThe mom's argument about not staying long is a point. If someone doesn't plan to stay in a country long-term, investing time in learning the language might not be a priority for them. The author might see this as a problem, but from the mother's perspective, it's a practical decision. \n\nAlso, the mother's role as a mother taking up time is a valid point. Learning a language requires time and effort, which might be challenging if she's already managing other responsibilities. The author might not fully grasp the balance her mom has to maintain. \n\nThe part where the mother mentions wanting to focus on religion and not needing to learn about other cultures or customs could be a cultural or personal choice. Different people have different values and priorities. The author might feel that education is important, but the mother's choice to focus elsewhere is her own. \n\nThe argument escalated when the mother dismissed the prophet's teachings about knowledge and education. That could be a sensitive religious point, leading to more tension. The author's comment about old age being unreasonable might have crossed a line, but it was in response to the mother's dismissal.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration comes from a desire to help her mom adapt, which is a good intention. However, the way the argument escalated might be due to the author not fully considering her mother's perspective. The mother has her reasons, and while the author's concern is valid, the approach might have been confrontational. \n\nThe key is whether the author's annoyance is justified. The mother isn't doing something that directly harms others; she's making a choice based on her own priorities. The author's reaction might stem from a place of wanting to help, but the way it's handled (storming off, calling the mother's reasoning invalid) could be seen as dismissive of the mother's valid reasons. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong to want her mom to learn English, but the approach and the resulting argument might not have been the best way to handle it. The mother's reasons are valid, so the author's frustration could be seen as not fully understanding her mother's situation. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's room for improvement in how she approached the situation. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's trying to encourage her mother, which is a positive intent, but the execution led to an argument, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. But considering the mother's valid reasons, maybe the author's annoyance isn't justified.\n"
