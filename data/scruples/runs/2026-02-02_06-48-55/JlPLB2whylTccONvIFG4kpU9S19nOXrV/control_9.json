You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the daughter is in the wrong for getting annoyed at her mom for not learning English after 20 years in the UK. The daughter is 19, her mom is 47. They had an argument where the daughter criticized her parents for not putting effort into learning the language, and the mom responded by saying she doesn't want to invest time because she doesn't plan on staying long and is busy as a mother. The mom also mentioned religion, which the daughter points out contradicts a previous religious teaching she used to emphasize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. The mom might be from a non-English speaking country, maybe a country where English isn't widely spoken. Even after 20 years, learning a new language is hard, especially if she didn't start as a child. The mom might have limited opportunities or support to learn English. Maybe she faces barriers like work, family responsibilities, or just the difficulty of language acquisition later in life. Also, the mom's comment about not staying long could mean she's planning to return to her home country, which would make learning English less necessary for her.\n\nThe daughter's frustration is understandable. She might be trying to help her mom navigate daily life in the UK, and not speaking English well can lead to challenges. But is it the daughter's responsibility to push her mom to learn? The mom is an adult and has the right to choose how she spends her time. The daughter might not realize the challenges her mom faces. Also, the mom's reaction was perhaps defensive or dismissive, which can escalate arguments.\n\nThe daughter's comment about the prophet and education might have been a trigger for the mom. The mom's harsh response (calling her an animal) was inappropriate, but the daughter's initial frustration might have been valid. However, the way the argument escalated could be due to both sides not listening. The daughter's approach might have been too confrontational, expecting her mom to learn English without considering her mom's perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The daughter isn't wrong for wanting her mom to improve her English, but she might have approached it in a way that didn't consider her mom's reasons. The mom's reasons (not planning to stay, being busy, not interested) are valid for her, even if the daughter disagrees. The daughter's frustration could stem from wanting to help, but she needs to respect her mom's choices. However, the mom's dismissal of the daughter's point and the harsh language definitely contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the daughter isn't in the wrong (B), but the situation is complex. The mom's reasons are valid, but the daughter's annoyance isn't entirely unreasonable. Both could have handled the conversation better. Still, the daughter isn't necessarily at fault for expressing her feelings, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
