You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning English in the country where they've lived for 20 years. The situation is that the author made a comment about their parents' limited English, which led to an argument. The mum responded by saying she doesn't see the need to invest time in the language since she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother with no time. She also mentioned focusing on religion instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents have lived in England for 20 years, which is a long time. The mum is in her 40s, so learning a new language at that age is challenging but not impossible. The author's frustration seems to stem from the mum's attitude towards not trying to integrate, especially when the mum is complaining about how English speakers can navigate problems easily. The author points out the inconsistency in the mum's reasoning, which is valid.\n\nThe mum's argument is that she doesn't plan to stay and that she's too busy. However, if they've been there for 20 years, maybe the mum's intentions have changed, or maybe the author expects them to stay longer. The mum might feel that her efforts aren't being recognized, or perhaps she had other reasons for not learning English. The author's comment about the prophet emphasizing knowledge and education could be a point the mum finds hypocritical if she's not following it now. \n\nThe author's tone shifted from a comment to being annoyed and then escalated into an argument. The mum's response included personal attacks, which is not okay. The author's last words were dismissive and possibly hurtful, implying that her behavior is due to old age. That's unkind and might have been a mistake in how the argument was handled.\n\nWhile the author has a valid point about their parents not making an effort, it's possible they didn't approach the conversation with enough empathy. The parents might be facing other challenges, or maybe the mum's approach to her role as a mother takes priority over learning a new language. The key here is whether the author's frustration was justified or if they overreacted. \n\nThe mum's unwillingness to learn could be due to various reasons, like not needing to use English beyond basic interactions, cultural reasons, or maybe feeling that it's too late. The author's comment about her age and the need to learn might come across as dismissive of those factors. The author's final remark is especially harsh, which might have been unnecessary even if they felt frustrated.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting their parents to learn the language, as it can help integration. However, the way they expressed their annoyance and the final comment might be what's problematic. The mum's response was also unhelpful, but the author's approach could have been more constructive. So, the answer might be A, as the author's frustration, while understandable, was expressed in a way that could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially considering the mum's age and possible justifications. Alternatively, if the mum's reasoning is invalid, the author might be right. But given the way the argument escalated, the author might have overstepped, hence being in the wrong.\n"
