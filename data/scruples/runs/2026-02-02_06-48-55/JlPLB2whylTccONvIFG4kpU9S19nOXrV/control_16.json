You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language after living in the country for 20 years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 19, and their mom is 47. They had an argument where the author criticized the mom for not learning English, which led to an explosive situation. The mom's reasons are that she doesn't see herself staying long, she's a mother with no time, and she wants to focus on religion. The mom also brought up the prophet's teachings about education, which seems contradictory to her current stance.\n\nNow, considering the factors here. The mom has lived in the country for 20 years. The author's frustration is understandable because the mom is in a position where knowing the language would help in daily life, especially since the mom is complaining about not being able to sort out problems. The author is trying to encourage their mom to improve her English, which is a reasonable expectation for someone living in the country for so long.\n\nBut wait, there's a cultural aspect here. Maybe the mom came from a different country where English isn't the first language. The mom's reasons for not learning English are that she doesn't plan to stay long and she's busy. However, living in a country for 20 years and not learning the language might seem like a lack of effort, especially if the country is England, where English is the primary language. \n\nThe mom's argument about not wanting to waste time could be a stretch. 20 years is a long time, and learning a language is a gradual process. If she's a mother, maybe she has other priorities, but 20 years is a significant period to not at least make some effort. On the other hand, the author called her an animal, which was probably not appropriate. The mom's response was also harsh, calling the author's arguments invalid.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's unwillingness to learn despite living there for two decades and the author's frustration leading to an argument. The author's annoyance is justified, but their approach might have been confrontational. However, the mom's resistance and the fact that she's in her 40s might mean she's set in her ways. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for expressing their frustration. Encouraging someone to learn the language of the country they live in, especially for 20 years, is reasonable. But the way the argument escalated, with the author using a sarcastic remark about old age, might have been the wrong approach. However, the core issue is the mom's attitude, not the author's concern. The author's annoyance is valid, but the method of communication could have been better. Still, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the mom's stance, the answer might be B (No).\n"
