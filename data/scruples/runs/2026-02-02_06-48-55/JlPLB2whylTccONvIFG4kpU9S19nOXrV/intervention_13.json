You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being annoyed with her mother for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years. The author's mother is 47, so she's been there for a while. The author is 19.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother lives in a country where English is the primary language. The daughter is frustrated because her parents can't speak English well, and the mother isn't making an effort. The mother's response is that she doesn't plan to stay long and doesn't have time as a mother, plus she's focusing on religion. The daughter brought up a religious argument about being knowledgeable, which the mother then dismissed harshly.\n\nHmm. The daughter's frustration is understandable. Being in a country for 20 years and not learning the language can be a barrier. But the mother has her own reasons. Maybe she's from a different culture where language learning isn't emphasized, or perhaps she's facing challenges. The daughter's comment about \"wasting time\" not making sense shows she thinks the mother should prioritize differently. But the mother might feel her time is limited or that she's not going to stay, so why invest? That's a valid point too.\n\nThe argument escalated quickly. The daughter's initial comment was in passing but led to a major fight. The mother's reaction was extreme, calling her a \"beast\" and dismissing her arguments. The daughter's last words about old age being unreasonable are harsh, but maybe she felt disrespected.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The daughter's intention was to encourage her mother to learn the language, which is a reasonable desire. However, the way she presented it might have been condescending or dismissive. The mother's reasons for not learning could be valid. The daughter might not have considered the mother's perspective fully. The mother's response was also inappropriate, but that doesn't mean the daughter is entirely right. The daughter's frustration is justified, but her approach might have been too confrontational. They both contributed to the argument, but the question is specifically about the daughter.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person deserves blame. The daughter's annoyance isn't wrong, but the way she handled it might have been. The mother's response was harsh, but the daughter's comment about religion and the mother's past teachings could have been a trigger. The daughter's final words were cutting, which is inconsiderate. However, the mother's unwillingness to learn might not be the daughter's problem to solve. The daughter's annoyance is valid, but the argument's escalation is on both sides. Considering all that, maybe the daughter isn't entirely in the wrong, but perhaps there's nuance. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the daughter's frustration is reasonable given the situation, even if the execution was poor. Alternatively, A if the daughter's approach was too harsh. But I think the key is that the daughter's intention was valid, and while the argument escalated, she's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting her mother to learn English. So answer B.\n"
