You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mum for not learning the language after 20 years in the country. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, who's 19, is upset because their parents, especially the mum, aren't speaking English well despite living in England for two decades. The mum argues that she doesn't want to invest time in learning the language because she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother with no time. The author brings up the mother's past teachings about the importance of knowledge and education, which the mother now seems to ignore.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's reasons for not learning English. She mentions that she doesn't see herself staying long, so maybe she's planning to return to her home country. Also, she's a mother and doesn't have time. The author thinks this is a poor excuse and is frustrated. The argument escalates, with the mother calling the author an animal and the author making a sarcastic remark about old age.\n\nNow, considering cultural and personal factors. The mother's decision might be influenced by her intention to leave, which is a valid reason. Also, balancing family responsibilities as a mother is a real challenge. The author is trying to encourage their mum, which is understandable, but the mother's reasons might be legitimate. The author's annoyance could stem from a desire to help their mum integrate better, but the mother isn't interested, possibly due to personal choices or circumstances.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's frustration is a natural reaction to seeing their parent not engage with the local language. However, the mother's reasons, though maybe not ideal, are her own choices. The argument became heated, and the author's response might have been harsh. The mother's defensiveness and the author's sarcastic remark could indicate a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting their mum to learn English, but the way the argument unfolded might not be their fault. The mother's refusal to engage and the harsh response might be more on her side. However, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, recognizing that the mother has her own reasons and priorities. The question is whether the author's annoyance is justified or if they overstepped.\n\nGiven the mother's stated reasons, even if the author disagrees, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing frustration. But maybe the approach could have been better. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the mother's valid points and the author's intent to encourage, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No), because the author's frustration is understandable given the mother's long-term residence and the mother's past teachings about education. The mother's refusal to learn despite her own past advice is a contradiction, which the author points out. However, the author's harsh reaction might not be justified, but the initial frustration isn't entirely their fault.\n"
