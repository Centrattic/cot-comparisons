You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning English after living in the UK for 20 years. \n\nFirst, the author is 19 and got into an argument with their mom, who's 47. The mom and dad can't speak English well, and the author made a comment about it. The argument escalated when the author suggested that if the mom had tried harder to learn, she could handle things better. The mom responded by saying she doesn't plan to stay long, is too busy as a mother, and now wants to focus on religion. The author brings up a past teaching about being knowledgeable, which the mom dismisses, leading to a shout.\n\nThe key points here are the author's frustration with their mom's lack of effort to learn the language, and the mom's reasons for not doing so. The author feels it's important to adapt, while the mom has her own priorities and possibly doesn't see the need. \n\nI need to consider cultural factors. If the mom is from a different country, maybe she's part of a community where English isn't necessary for daily life, or perhaps there are other languages spoken in their community. The mom might feel that since she doesn't plan to stay long, investing time in learning English isn't worth it. Also, being a mother could mean she's focused on family and has less time. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from frustration that their mom isn't trying, but maybe the mom has valid reasons. The author's comment about old age and unreasonable behavior might have been a bit harsh, but the mom also called the author an animal. \n\nIt's a family conflict, and both sides might have valid points. The author isn't wrong for wanting their mom to adapt, but the mom isn't wrong for prioritizing other things. The question is whether the author's annoyance is justified. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to encourage their mom, but the situation is complex. However, the author's reaction might have been too harsh, but the core issue isn't the author's fault. So leaning towards B.\n"
