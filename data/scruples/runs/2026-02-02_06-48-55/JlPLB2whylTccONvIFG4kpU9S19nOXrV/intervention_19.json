You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after living in the country for 20 years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 19 and had an argument with their 47-year-old mother. The mom has been in the country for 20 years but can't speak English well. The author tried to point out that learning the language would help her deal with problems. The mom responds by saying she doesn't plan on staying long, is a mother, and wants to focus on religion. The author then brings up a religious teaching about being knowledgeable, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're in the wrong for encouraging their mom to educate herself and being annoyed at her unwillingness. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to help their mom adapt, which is a valid concern. Learning the local language can improve life in many ways. But the author's approach led to an argument. The tone of the comment might have been dismissive, especially since the mom has her reasons for not learning. The mom mentioned not planning to stay long and being a mother, which are valid points. The author's response about being a mother not being an excuse seems to invalidate the mom's position. Also, the author used a religious argument, which the mom might not appreciate, especially since she's focusing on religion now. The argument escalated quickly, and the author's last comment about old age was probably hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. They might feel that their mom isn't making an effort, which could affect their own life, like if the mom needs help. But the way the author expressed their thoughts was confrontational. It's possible the author didn't consider their mom's perspective or reasons, leading to the argument. The mom's reasons (not staying long, being a mother, focusing on religion) need to be respected even if the author disagrees.\n\nSo, while the author's intention is good, the method of confrontation and the tone might be where they went wrong. The author could have approached the conversation differently, perhaps with more empathy and understanding. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation sensitively. But I need to check if the mom's reasons are valid. The mom's stance that she doesn't plan to stay long is a legitimate reason. The author's annoyance without considering the mom's perspective could be seen as the issue.\n"
