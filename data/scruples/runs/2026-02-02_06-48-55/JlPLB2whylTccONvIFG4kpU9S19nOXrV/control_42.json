You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for getting annoyed at their mom for not learning the language after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 19, their mom is 47. The mom has been in England for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The author made a comment about that, leading to an argument. The mom says she doesn't want to learn because she doesn't plan to stay long and is busy being a mother. Also, she doesn't want to focus on education or culture, just religion. The author feels the mom was unreasonable, especially since the mom used to talk about the importance of knowledge from their prophet. The author ended up calling the mom out, leading to a shouting match.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author is trying to encourage their mom to learn the language, which could be seen as a reasonable desire to help her integrate. But the way they approached it, making a comment in passing that escalated into an argument, might have been unkind or dismissive. The mom's reasons for not learning might be valid\u2014maybe she's not planning to stay, and maybe she's busy with family responsibilities. The author's frustration is understandable, but the tone and timing of their comment might have been the problem.\n\nThe mom's response\u2014calling the author an animal and saying their arguments are invalid\u2014shows that the conversation became hostile. The author's last comment about old age being unreasonable is probably not helpful either. Both sides contributed to the conflict. However, the author's initial comment, while made in passing, could have been a trigger. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing frustration about their mom's lack of effort. \n\nCulturally, there might be factors at play. Maybe the mom feels pressure from her own beliefs about education versus tradition. The author's push might clash with the mom's priorities. The author might not be wrong to want their mom to learn, but the way they expressed it led to conflict. So, while the author's intention isn't wrong, the approach was. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the author's frustration was justified but the method was poor, maybe it's a shared responsibility.\n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The user is saying they're not crazy for being annoyed. So, considering that, the author is not in the wrong for wanting their mom to learn, but maybe they handled it poorly. However, the question is about being in the wrong for the annoyance itself. Since the mom's reasons are valid, but the author's frustration is also understandable, it's a bit nuanced. But given the context, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed, as they have valid reasons to want their parent to integrate, even if the delivery was poor.\n"
