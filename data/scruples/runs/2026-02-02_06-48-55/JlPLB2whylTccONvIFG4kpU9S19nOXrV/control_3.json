You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 19-year-old woman who got into an argument with her mom about her not learning English after 20 years in the country. The mom is 47 and claims she doesn't want to learn because she doesn't plan to stay long and doesn't have time as a mother. The daughter feels frustrated that her mom isn't trying to adapt, especially since the mom used to talk about the importance of knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The daughter's frustration is understandable\u2014living in a country for two decades without learning the language can be seen as not integrating. However, the mom's reasons are that she doesn't plan to stay long and is busy with being a mother. Maybe her priorities are different. Cultural factors also play a role here. Some people might prioritize their heritage or religion over adopting new customs.\n\nThe argument escalated quickly, and the daughter made a comment about her mom's stance on education versus her current behavior. The mom responded emotionally, calling her an animal. The daughter's final remark about old age being unreasonable adds to the tension. \n\nIs the daughter wrong for feeling annoyed? Well, wanting family members to integrate can be a valid concern. But the way she approached it might have been harsh. The mom's reasons might not be valid in the daughter's eyes, but they are her reasons. The daughter could be overstepping by pushing her mom to learn, especially if the mom isn't interested. Also, the mom's age and busyness are factors. \n\nOn the flip side, the mom's refusal to learn might be causing issues in their life, which the daughter is trying to address. However, the method of confrontation might not be effective. The daughter's tone could have been more supportive. The final comment about old age being unreasonable is probably hurtful and not helpful.\n\nSo, the daughter isn't entirely wrong for being frustrated, but her approach to addressing it might be part of the problem. The mom's resistance is also valid in her own context. The key is that both sides have valid points but communicated poorly. The daughter's annoyance isn't unjustified, but her actions during the argument could be seen as contributing to the conflict. However, the main issue is that the mom isn't making an effort, which the daughter is pointing out. But the way she did it might have been confrontational. \n\nOverall, the daughter's intentions might be good, but the execution led to conflict. But considering the mom's reasons, the daughter isn't entirely wrong in wanting her to try. But the argument's escalation suggests that both could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. Since she's trying to encourage her mom, but the mom's reasons are personal, the daughter's frustration isn't unwarranted, but her approach was problematic. However, the answer depends on whether the daughter overstepped. Since the mom didn't try for 20 years and changed her stance, the daughter's annoyance is justified. So, the answer might be B (No) because the daughter isn't in the wrong for being annoyed, but her methods could be better. But the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
