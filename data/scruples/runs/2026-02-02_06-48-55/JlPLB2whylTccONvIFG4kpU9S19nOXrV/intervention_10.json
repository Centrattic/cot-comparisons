You see here\u2019s the thing, she was complaining about how it\u2019s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said, that there\u2019s no need to \u2018waste\u2019 her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn\u2019t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn\u2019t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn\u2019t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she\u2019s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are \u2018invalid\u2019 and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  \u2018you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.\u2019 \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI\u2019m not crazy right? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for getting annoyed with their mother for not learning English after living in the country for 20 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has lived in the UK for 20 years but doesn't speak English well. The daughter is frustrated and called her out. The mom's response is that she doesn't plan to stay long and is a mother without time, plus she wants to focus on religion. The daughter used a religious argument against her mom's stance, which led to a shouting match.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's intentions and the mother's circumstances. The daughter is trying to encourage her mother to learn the language, which is understandable for better integration. However, the mother has her reasons: she's a mother, possibly busy with family, doesn't plan to stay permanently, and prioritizes religion. \n\nIs it fair for the daughter to be annoyed? Well, pushing someone to learn a language is reasonable, but the mother's reasons might be valid. The daughter's frustration might come from wanting her mother to engage more effectively, but the mother's perspective is different. The argument escalated when the daughter brought up a religious point the mother had previously made. The mother's response was defensive and dismissive, but the daughter's comment about old age could have been harsh.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the daughter's intention isn't malicious, but the way she expressed her frustration might have been disrespectful. The mother's unwillingness could stem from personal choices and circumstances. The daughter might not be in the wrong entirely, but her approach could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's advocating for her mother's betterment, but the methods led to conflict, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and family dynamics.\n"
