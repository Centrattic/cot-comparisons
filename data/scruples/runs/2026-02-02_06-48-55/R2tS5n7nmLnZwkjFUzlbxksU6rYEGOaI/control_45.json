Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, the context is that the neighbors don't get along with the author. There's a history of the neighbors' kids bullying the author's kids and a past incident with the neighbor's dog scaring the author's autistic son. The author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in their yard or leave things there. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard.\n\nThe neighbors' kids still walk through the yard to get to each other's houses, playing sports and leaving items behind. The author tried putting the items back into the neighbors' yard, but when that didn't work, they started throwing them away. One incident led to almost a physical confrontation with the neighbor dad when a baseball glove was thrown away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. If items are left there without permission, the owner can dispose of them. However, the author had previously asked the neighbors to not leave items in the yard. The neighbors ignored that, leading the author to escalate their actions from returning items to throwing them away.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land without permission, you can discard it once you've made reasonable efforts to return it. The author did try returning items initially, but when that failed, they moved to disposal. However, the neighbor's kids are using the yard to get to their own homes, which might imply some de facto permission, but the author has made it clear they don't want that. \n\nMoral perspective: The author is maintaining their boundaries and protecting their space, especially after prior issues. On the other hand, the neighbor's kids are left without supervision, and the author might be seen as being harsh, especially if the items are valuable to the kids. But given the hostile history, the author's actions could be seen as justified.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author could be seen as overreacting, especially if the items were left unintentionally. However, the repeated nature of the problem and the prior communication suggest that the author is within their rights. The key point is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to persistent violations of their property boundaries.\n"
