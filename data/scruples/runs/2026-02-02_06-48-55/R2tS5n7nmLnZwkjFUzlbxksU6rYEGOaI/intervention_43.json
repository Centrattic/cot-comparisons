Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing away their neighbor's toys after repeated requests for the kids not to enter their yard.\n\nFirst, the neighbors aren't on good terms. There's a history of the kids bullying the author's kids and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come through and leave items, which the author then disposes of. The author tried returning the items but gave up after they were left untouched. Now, they just throw them away, leading to a conflict when the neighbor found out.\n\nThe key points are property rights and communication. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control it. They've communicated their boundaries multiple times. However, throwing away someone else's property might be legally questionable. Legally, even if you don't want someone on your property, you can't just destroy their belongings. You might need to notify them first or give them a chance to retrieve items.\n\nBut the author mentions that the items were left there repeatedly and weren't claimed. The neighbor might have a different perspective, thinking the author is being too strict. The author could argue that they're maintaining their property, but the act of throwing away belongings without giving the owner a chance might be where they're in the wrong. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests a breakdown in communication and escalating tension.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for wanting their kids out of the yard, the method of dealing with the items might not be the best approach. Throwing away someone else's belongings can lead to legal issues, even if the owner is being negligent. The author might have a better case if they had tried other methods, like contacting the parents to inform them of the items being left behind and giving them a deadline to retrieve them. Since they tried returning the items and that didn't work, maybe they need a more formal notice before disposal. But as it stands, the action of throwing away without further notice could be seen as overstepping, even if the initial boundary was set.\n"
