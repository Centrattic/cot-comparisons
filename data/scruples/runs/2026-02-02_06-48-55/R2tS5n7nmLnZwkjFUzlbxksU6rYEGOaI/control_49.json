Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The context is that the neighbors don't get along with them, there have been issues with the kids bullying their own children, and the author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their private property. If someone leaves items on your property, you generally have the right to dispose of them, especially if they're abandoned. The author mentioned they've left the items before, but they stayed there indefinitely without being claimed. Now they're throwing them away, which seems reasonable if the items are considered abandoned.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The kids are going through the yard to get to each other's houses. That might mean they're using the yard as a shortcut, which the author has already told them not to do. If the kids are repeatedly entering the yard despite being told not to, that's trespassing. The author's action of disposing the items could be seen as a way to enforce their boundaries. \n\nBut there's also the neighbor's reaction. The neighbor almost came to blows when the baseball glove was thrown away. That's a sign of tension. However, the author did tell them upfront that they were throwing it away. The question is whether the author overstepped by just discarding items instead of returning them. \n\nLegally, the author might be within their rights to remove abandoned property. But socially, it could be seen as harsh, especially if the items are valuable to the kids. The author could have perhaps given a warning before discarding, but they mentioned multiple requests to keep the kids out. \n\nIn some cases, people might choose to return items to avoid conflict, but the author's situation involves a strained relationship and past incidents. The author is trying to set clear boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they're enforcing their property rights and have communicated their wishes. The answer should be B (No).\n"
