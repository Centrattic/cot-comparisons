Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys that neighbor kids left in their yard. The neighbors don't get along, there's been past issues with the kids bullying their children and a dog incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what happens on it. If the neighbor's kids are entering the yard without permission, that's one issue. But the main question is about the toys left behind. \n\nThe author mentions they've told the neighbors multiple times not to let their kids use the yard or leave things there. The kids keep coming in, leaving items. The author initially left the items there, but when that didn't work, started returning them, then now throws them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away. \n\nNow, legally, if someone leaves property on your land, do you have the right to dispose of it? In many jurisdictions, if someone abandons property on your land, you can dispose of it after a reasonable time. However, if the items are still in use (like sports equipment), maybe not. But the author has a history of the neighbors not respecting their property, so there's a pattern here.\n\nEthically, the author tried to communicate their boundaries. They first left the items, then tried returning them, which didn't work. Throwing them away after repeated issues might be seen as a reasonable step when all other methods failed. But the neighbor's reaction complicates things. The author's justification is protecting their own space and ensuring safety, especially considering the past bullying and the dog incident. However, throwing away items might be seen as extreme, especially if the items are valuable or the neighbors might need them. \n\nBut given that the author has made their boundaries clear and the neighbors continue to disregard them, the author's actions could be seen as self-protective. The key points are communication and the neighbors' lack of respect for those boundaries. The author isn't inviting the kids, so the toys aren't left by permission. \n\nIn AITA terms, it's about whether the author overreacted. While throwing away items could be harsh, if the neighbors aren't listening and the author is trying to maintain their space, maybe it's justified. The author isn't keeping the items for themselves, just removing them. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because of the clear communication and the neighbors' repeated disregard for those boundaries.\n"
