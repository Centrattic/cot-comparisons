Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left by their neighbors' kids in their yard.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along. There's been past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Their kids don't go into the neighbors' yards. The neighbors' kids keep leaving items in the yard, so the author started throwing them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nNow, considering property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. However, throwing away items that belong to others could be an issue. If the items are left on the property, does the owner have the right to dispose of them, especially after giving notice? \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author did give multiple warnings to the neighbors about not wanting their kids in the yard. The neighbors are continuing to leave items despite this. The author tried to return items initially but now just throws them away. The key point is whether the author is legally allowed to discard someone else's belongings even if they were left on their property. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land without permission, you can't assume ownership. However, if you've notified them and they continue, you might have a case for being a trespasser. But disposing of their items could lead to legal issues because it's not the owner's to discard. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's dad was upset, which shows that the action caused conflict. The author might be in the wrong because while they have the right to their property, they don't have the right to destroy or discard another's belongings unless given permission. The proper approach might be to store the items until the owner claims them, not throw them away.\n"
