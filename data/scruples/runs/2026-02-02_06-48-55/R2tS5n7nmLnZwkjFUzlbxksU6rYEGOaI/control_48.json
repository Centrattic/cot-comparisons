Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they don't get along with their neighbors. The neighbors' kids have been bullying their kids, and there was an incident with a dog that scared their autistic son. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. Despite that, the neighbors' kids keep coming through the yard during games and leaving items like baseball gloves, balls, etc.\n\nThe author used to leave the items there, but since they weren't claimed, they started throwing them back into the neighbors' yard. Now they just throw them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor dad found out about the glove being thrown away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the property. Let me think about property rights. Generally, if someone leaves something on your property, you have the right to dispose of it, especially if it's abandoned. But there might be nuances. If the items are still considered the neighbors' property, the author might need to return them or notify the owner. However, if the author gave prior notice that the kids shouldn't be in their yard, then maybe the responsibility is on the neighbors for allowing the kids to leave items there. The author could argue that they've done their part by informing the neighbors and now is dealing with the consequence of abandoned items. But maybe the author should have given more notice before disposing of the items, especially since they led to a confrontation. The neighbor might feel that the author acted without communication. But given the history of conflict, maybe the author felt justified. Legally, maybe it's okay, but socially it might be seen as harsh. The answer might depend on local laws about abandoned property. However, since the author is asking for moral judgment (AITA), it's about social norms. If the author made it clear they don't want the items, throwing them away could be seen as reasonable. But the confrontation suggests that the neighbor didn't expect that. Alternatively, maybe the author should have returned the items instead. Hmm. There's a balance between respecting property rights and maintaining neighborly relations. The author might not be in the wrong because they own their property and can manage it as they see fit, especially after warnings. But maybe there's an expectation to return items if possible. However, if it's clear the items are abandoned, disposal is acceptable. I think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
