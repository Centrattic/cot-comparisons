Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along because of differences and past issues, including the neighbor's dog scaring the author's autistic son. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The kids still come through, play, and leave items behind. The author tried leaving the items but they were never claimed, then started throwing them back, and now just throws them away. The neighbor dad almost got into a fight when a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone leaves items on your property, technically you can dispose of them, especially if they're abandoned. But the neighbors might argue that their kids were just passing through, so maybe the items weren't abandoned. However, the author had already communicated not to leave things there. If the kids kept doing it despite the warnings, maybe the author is justified. Also, the prior incidents (bullying, dog incident) add context that the author has a reason to be protective.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have given more notice or tried to return the items directly to the kids instead of throwing them away. But the user says they tried leaving them, and they were never claimed. Throwing them away is a bit harsh, but perhaps understandable given the circumstances. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, which complicates things. The author isn't wrong for protecting their property, especially after setting boundaries. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
