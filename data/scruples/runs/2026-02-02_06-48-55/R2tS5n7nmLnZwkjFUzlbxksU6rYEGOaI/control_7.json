Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying, and the author has told the neighbors not to let their kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author used to put the items back but now throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission, which is a problem. The author did inform the neighbors not to let their kids in, but the kids are still coming. \n\nBut the key issue is the disposal of the items. When someone leaves property on another's land, does the landowner have the right to dispose of it? Legally, if the items are considered abandoned\u2014meaning the owner has given up all claim\u2014they might be fair game. However, if the items were left in good faith but the owner didn't know they were on someone else's property, it's different. Here, the kids are entering without permission, so they might not realize they're on the author's yard. But the author had already communicated that they didn't want the kids there. \n\nThe author tried putting the items back initially, which was a reasonable step. When that didn't work, throwing them away could be seen as a response to repeated violations. However, the neighbor Dad was upset and almost came to blows, which complicates things. The author's actions might be seen as reasonable self-defense of their property, especially since they made their wishes clear. \n\nBut there's also the consideration of neighborly relations. Even if the author isn't legally in the wrong, the conflict might have been mitigated differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since the author owns the property and communicated their boundaries, their actions might be justified. The neighbors' kids repeatedly ignored the instructions, so the author's response, while perhaps harsh, could be seen as a last resort. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if the items are abandoned, the owner can dispose of them. But if the items were left accidentally or without knowledge of the property line, the author might have a duty to return them. However, since the author had already told the neighbors not to have their kids there, the kids entering and leaving items could be considered trespassing and leaving trash. The author's actions might be within their rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
