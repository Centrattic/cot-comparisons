Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the neighbor's kids leaving toys in the author's yard, and the author throwing them away. The author has already asked them not to come into the yard or leave things there. The neighbors are not on good terms, there was some bullying and a dog incident involving the author's autistic son.\n\nFirst, property rights: The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what happens there. If the neighbors' kids are entering without permission and leaving items, the author isn't obligated to keep those items. But maybe the issue is how they handle it.\n\nThe author initially tried returning the items to the neighbors' yard. Then shifted to throwing them away. The neighbor Dad almost had a confrontation when the glove was thrown away. The question is whether the author overstepped by discarding the items.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land, you might not have the right to just throw it away. Usually, you might be required to make a reasonable effort to return lost property. But the author has already tried returning them to the neighbors' yard. If the items were left there for a long time without being claimed, maybe the author could argue they're abandoned. However, the neighbor's dad might still consider them his kids' property.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author has a right to their space and safety. The neighbor kids' behavior is disruptive and the author is protecting their home. But throwing away items might be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like tagging the items and storing them for a while before disposal.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as justified because they've communicated their boundaries clearly and the neighbors aren't respecting them. However, the confrontation suggests that the neighbor felt wronged. The author might be in the right because they own the property and have the right to remove items, especially after repeated issues. But maybe the author could have given more notice or stored the items longer. But the question is if they're in the wrong. Given the context of the bad relations and the author's prior attempts to be reasonable, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
