Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. They had a bad relationship with the neighbors, some past issues with bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming and leaving things. The author used to leave the items there, but now just throws them away, leading to a conflict when the neighbor almost came to blows.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). My initial thought is that the author is in a tough spot. They've given clear boundaries, but the neighbors are not respecting them. However, throwing away someone else's property might be legally and morally questionable. Even if the owner is annoyed, does that give them the right to dispose of others' belongings? \n\nBut on the other hand, the neighbors are violating the author's property by letting their kids enter and leave items. The author has tried to return the items, but when that doesn't work, maybe they feel justified in getting rid of them. However, legally, you can't just throw away someone else's property without trying to return it first. The author did try to return them, but when that's ignored, maybe they have a point. However, even after multiple attempts, if the items are left again, the author might need to contact the authorities or get a legal notice. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be understandable given the bad relationship and the kids not respecting the boundaries, but legally, they might be in the wrong. The neighbor's property (the toys) still belongs to them, so the author has no right to dispose of them. Even if the author tried to return them before, once the items are on their property, they should be kept until the rightful owner can claim them. So the answer might be A (in the wrong), but maybe B (not in the wrong) because of the context. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. The key factors are: the author's attempt to return items, the neighbors' continued disregard for the rules, and the fact that the author is trying to enforce their boundaries. But legally, you can't just throw away someone else's stuff. However, in some jurisdictions, if you give notice and the items are left unclaimed, you might be able to do something. But the author's approach of throwing them away without notice might be the issue. The author did try to return them before, so maybe when the kids keep leaving them, the author's frustration leads to this action. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they have no legal right to dispose of others' property, even if the neighbors are being difficult. The proper approach would be to contact the neighbors or authorities, not to destroy the items.\n"
