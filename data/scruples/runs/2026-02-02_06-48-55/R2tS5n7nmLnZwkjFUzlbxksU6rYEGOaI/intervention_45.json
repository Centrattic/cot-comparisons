Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves ongoing tension between the neighbors, with the writer's kids not being allowed in the neighbors' yard, but the neighbors' kids coming onto their yard and leaving items.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The writer owns their yard and has the right to control who enters and what stays there. They've already made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the neighbors' kids keep coming and leaving things. The writer has tried returning the items but now throws them away after repeated incidents.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the writer give sufficient notice? Yes, they made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Did the neighbors' kids ignore those instructions and leave items? Yes. The writer is taking action by removing the items, which could be seen as their right since the items are left on their property without permission.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for escalation. The neighbor dad almost came to blows when the glove was thrown away. The writer might be seen as taking it too far by discarding items, which can be seen as malicious or provocative. But given the prior communication and the fact that the items were left on their property, the writer might argue it's necessary to enforce their boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the writer should have tried another approach first, like leaving the items in a visible spot where the neighbors could retrieve them, rather than throwing them away immediately. That might have been a more neutral solution. But since the writer has already tried returning the items and that didn't work, throwing them away could be justified as a last resort.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the writer clearly communicated their wishes and the neighbors ignored them, then removing the items is a reasonable step. However, the act of throwing away personal property of others could be seen as crossing a line, even if the items are left in the yard. It might depend on local laws, but generally, property owners can remove items left by others that are trespassing. Still, the neighbor's reaction suggests it's a sensitive issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the writer is protecting their property after proper notice and trying to return items before discarding. The escalation is unfortunate, but the core issue is about respecting property boundaries.\n"
