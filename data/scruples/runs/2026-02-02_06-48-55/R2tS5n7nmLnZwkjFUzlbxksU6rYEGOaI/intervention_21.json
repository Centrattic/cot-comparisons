Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the neighbor kids leaving their toys in the author's yard, and the author is throwing them away. The author mentions that they've already tried to communicate their boundaries by telling the neighbors not to let their kids be in the yard or leave things there. The neighbors' kids still end up coming through the yard and leaving items, which the author then disposes of. \n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their private property, so they have the right to control what happens there. If the neighbors' kids are entering without permission, that's trespassing. But when items are left on the property, the owner can decide what to do with them. However, there's a nuance here. If the items are lost or abandoned, the owner might have the right to dispose of them after a reasonable amount of time. But how long is reasonable? The author mentions that they used to leave the items and they stayed there indefinitely without being claimed. Now they just throw them away.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate their boundaries by telling the neighbors not to let their kids in the yard, but the kids still come through. So, the author is trying to enforce their rules. The issue is whether throwing away the items is an overreaction. The neighbor dad almost got into a fight because of this, which shows that the neighbors are upset. \n\nAnother angle is the initial conflict. The author had a history with the neighbors, including the dog incident with their autistic son. That might affect how the neighbors perceive the author's actions. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so there's some consistency there. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you can take reasonable steps to return it or dispose of it if it's abandoned. However, \"reasonable steps\" might include notifying the owner first. The author did mention they asked the neighbors not to leave things, so maybe that's their attempt at notification. But once the items are left, the author is taking action. The question is whether that action is justified. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel wronged because of the previous conflicts, which could influence their decision to throw away the items. The neighbors, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being overly harsh, especially if the items are just left temporarily during play. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they've communicated their wishes and the neighbors aren't respecting that, then the author is trying to protect their property. However, throwing away items might be seen as harsh, especially if the items aren't claimed immediately. Maybe the author could have tried other steps first, like contacting the parents each time an item was left. But given the ongoing conflict, the author might not want to interact. \n\nIn summary, the author is taking a firm stance on their property rights, but the method of disposal could be seen as excessive. However, legally, they might have the right to do so. The answer depends on balancing property rights with neighborly expectations and the context of prior conflicts.\n"
