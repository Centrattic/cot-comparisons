Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation is a bit tense between the families. There's a history of conflict, including bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave stuff. The author used to return items but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If the neighbors leave items there, the author isn't obligated to keep them. However, there's also a social aspect. Even if the neighbors are difficult, throwing away items might be seen as harsh. The author did try to return them before, which shows they were trying to be good-natured. But after repeated issues and the neighbor getting angry, maybe their frustration is justified.\n\nThe key points are: the author communicated their boundaries, the neighbors didn't respect them, and the author is taking action to enforce those boundaries. Legally, the author can dispose of items left on their property, especially if they're considered abandoned. But socially, it's a gray area. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, which might indicate that the author's action was a trigger for existing tensions. However, the author's right to their property is a strong point in their favor. So, while the author's actions might be legally sound, the social implications could make them seem harsh. But since the neighbors were already in the wrong by not respecting the boundaries, the author's response might be justified. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're enforcing their property rights after clear communication.\n"
