Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids, after multiple requests for the kids to stay out of their yard.\n\nFirst, the neighbors don't get along, and there's a history of issues like bullying and a dog scaring the author's autistic son. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. The kids still come through, leave items, and the author eventually throws the items away, leading to a conflict with the neighbor dad.\n\nThe key points here are property rights and communication. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what happens on their property. They've communicated their boundaries multiple times, but the neighbors' kids aren't respecting that. The author is taking action to enforce their rules by removing the items. However, throwing away someone else's property can be legally and ethically questionable. Even if the yard is private, tossing items without giving the owner a chance to retrieve them might be seen as going too far, especially if the items are valuable or sentimental.\n\nBut considering the ongoing issues and the neighbor's lack of respect for the author's boundaries, maybe the author's actions are a reaction to persistent violations. However, the ethical angle here is about resolving conflicts peacefully. The author could have tried other methods first, like returning the items to the neighbor, sending a message, or involving authorities if necessary. Throwing things away without notice might escalate tensions unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, in many places, you can't just discard someone else's property without giving them a chance to reclaim it. You might need to follow specific procedures, like giving notice or contacting local authorities. So legally, the author might be in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author has the right to protect their property from being trespassed and to enforce boundaries, but\u5904\u7f6e items might not be the best approach. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given the history with the neighbors. But the best course of action would be to handle it through proper channels rather than taking matters into their own hands. So, while the author has valid grievances, the method of discarding items might not be justified, making them the asshole in this scenario.\n"
