Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbors' kids. The backstory is that the neighbors don't get along with them, there's been some bullying, and the neighbor's dog scared the user's autistic son. The user has told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out or leave things in their yard. They used to leave the items there, but now they throw them away immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The user's yard is their private property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If the items were left there without permission, the user isn't obligated to keep them. However, the neighbor's dad was upset and almost came to blows, which suggests the situation is tense. \n\nThe user did ask the neighbors not to leave items in their yard, so it's not like they're doing this without prior communication. The neighbor kids keep coming into the yard despite being told, which might mean the user is trying to enforce boundaries. Throwing away items could be seen as a way to prevent the kids from returning. \n\nBut, the items might still have value to the neighbors. Even though they were left in the yard, the user could have tried returning them instead. By throwing them away, the user is destroying property that doesn't belong to them. Legally, if someone leaves property there, the owner of the property can dispose of it if it's not claimed, but it's a gray area. \n\nEthically, it's about respect and neighborly conduct. The user has a justified reason due to past issues, but the way they handle it could be seen as harsh. Maybe a middle ground would be to keep the items for a certain time and then dispose, but the user didn't mention that. \n\nSo, the user's actions are understandable given the conflict, but ethically, they might be in the wrong because they're disposing of others' property. However, if the neighbors are negligent in retrieving their items, the user isn't obligated to keep them. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're protecting their property and have communicated their boundaries. But some might argue it's unneighborly. \n\nLooking at similar AITA cases, usually, if you make it clear not to leave items and they continue, you can dispose of them. The user's situation seems defensible. The answer is likely B.\n"
