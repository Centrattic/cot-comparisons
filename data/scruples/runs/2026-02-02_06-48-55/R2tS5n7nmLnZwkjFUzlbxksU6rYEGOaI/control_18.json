Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys that neighbor kids left in their yard. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying issues, and the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard.\n\nFirst, property rights are a big part here. The author owns their yard, so technically, they have the right to control what's on their property. If the neighbors' kids are leaving items there, it's on the author's property. However, the question is about whether throwing them away is wrong.\n\nThe author tried to return the items before, but the neighbors didn't claim them. Now they just throw them away. The key point is that the author has communicated their boundaries. If the items are considered abandoned, then the author might have the right to dispose of them. But maybe there's a legal aspect here. In some places, even if someone leaves property on your land, you can't just throw it away; you might have to make a reasonable effort to return it. But the author did return them initially, and when that wasn't effective, they stopped. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author has a history of conflict complicates things. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, so there's tension. But legally, if the author owns the property, they might not be in the wrong. However, ethically, maybe there's a gray area. The author could be seen as taking it too far by throwing away items, especially if the neighbors might still want them. But since the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, the presence of the toys is a result of the kids not respecting those boundaries. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author was given a chance to return the items. Since they did try returning them before, and the items were left unclaimed, it's possible the author has a right to dispose of them. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
