Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is at fault for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbor's kids. The neighbors don't get along, and there's a history of issues like bullying and a dog scaring the autistic son. The author has told the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard, but the kids still do and leave stuff there. The author used to put the items back into the neighbors' yard but now throws them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost got into a fight because his kid's glove was thrown out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether throwing away the items is wrong. From a legal standpoint, property is private, and the author owns their yard. If items are left there without permission, the owner isn't obligated to keep them. But there's also the social aspect. The author tried to put the items back first, then escalated to throwing them away. The neighbor's reaction suggests they felt wronged. However, the author had made their boundaries clear, and the neighbors' kids kept ignoring those boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as protecting their property and enforcing their rules. But throwing things away without returning might be seen as harsh. However, if the items are left indefinitely and the neighbors aren't claiming them, the author might have a right to dispose of them. The key is whether the author had reasonable attempts to return the items before moving to disposal. Since they tried moving them back but now throw them away, maybe it's understandable. But it's a bit of a gray area. The answer would likely be B, not at fault, because they're on their property and have set boundaries.\n"
