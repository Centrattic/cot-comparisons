Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys that neighbor kids left in their yard. The background is that the neighbors don't get along with the author, and there's been some bullying of the author's children. The author has already told the neighbors that they don't want the kids coming into their yard or leaving things there. The neighbors' kids keep coming in and leaving items, which the author now throws away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their private property, so they have the right to control what happens there. If something is left in their yard, technically, it's on their property. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for discarding the items after the kids left them there. \n\nThe neighbors' kids might be under the impression that the author's yard is part of a shared play area between the two houses. The author mentions that the kids are walking through the yard to get to each other's houses, which suggests the yard might be a common path. If that's the case, maybe the kids aren't aware they're entering the author's property. However, the author has already made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. So the kids are violating the author's wishes by coming in and leaving items.\n\nBut even if the author doesn't want the kids in the yard, the items left behind might belong to the kids. Discarding someone else's belongings, even if they were left in the author's yard, could be considered a problem. However, the author has tried to return items in the past, but the neighbors didn't claim them. Now the author is just throwing them away, which the neighbor found offensive. \n\nI should think about the legal aspect. Generally, property owners can't just throw away items left in their yard by others without returning them or giving a chance to claim them. But maybe there's a different rule if the items were left intentionally and the owner has made it clear they don't want them. However, the children might not be old enough to understand property boundaries, and their parents might be responsible for these items.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a bit harsh, but considering the previous issues (bullying, the dog incident), the author might feel justified in protecting their space. However, throwing the items away without trying to contact the parents again might be crossing a line. The neighbor's dad was upset, which the author acknowledges. The author might be in the right in wanting to protect their yard and their children, but the method of dealing with the toys could be a point of contention.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author gave the neighbors a reasonable opportunity to retrieve the items. Since the author initially tried to return them but then resorted to throwing them away after the kids kept leaving items, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. But legally, it might be expected that they provide notice or a chance to claim the items before discarding. The author's actions could be seen as a little strict, but given the context of the conflict, it's possible they're not the asshole. I'm leaning towards B, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's a middle ground like giving the items to the local authorities or a neighbor to return. But the author's approach might be within their rights given the prior communication and the lack of cooperation from the neighbors.\n"
