Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The neighbors don't get along with the author, and there's a history of issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author tried leaving the items for a while, but since they were never claimed, they started throwing them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor dad found out.\n\nNow, legal vs. moral aspects. Legally, the author owns their property. If someone leaves items on their land, the owner can dispose of them if they're considered abandoned property after a reasonable time. The exact time varies by jurisdiction, but if the items were left indefinitely without being claimed, the author might be within their rights.\n\nMorally, it's trickier. The author tried to communicate their boundaries, but the neighbors didn't respect them. The author's actions could be seen as self-defense of their property. However, throwing away items that might still be valuable to the kids could be seen as harsh, especially if the neighbor dad reacted strongly. The fact that there's a history of conflict might justify the author's frustration.\n\nBut did the author give enough notice? They mentioned they asked the neighbors multiple times. If they had signs or formal notices, that might strengthen their case. However, the kids still continued to come through. The author's escalation from returning items to throwing them away could be a point of contention. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that the action was perceived as offensive, even if legally acceptable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to enforce their property boundaries. The proportionality might depend on how long they waited before discarding the items. If they gave ample time and the items were truly abandoned, then it's justified. But if the items were still in use or the neighbors were actively looking for them, it could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author's children are autistic, which might add context about why they wanted the yard clear of strangers and potential hazards. The dog incident adds another layer of concern for their safety.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be justified in their actions, especially if they followed their local laws about abandoned property. However, the conflict with the neighbor dad and the potential for further escalation might make people question if there's a more diplomatic approach. But in the context of the AITA, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not if there's a better solution. If they adhered to the law and their boundaries were clear, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
