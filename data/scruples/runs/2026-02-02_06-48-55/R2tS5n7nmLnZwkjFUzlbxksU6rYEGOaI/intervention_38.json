Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying issues, and the author has already communicated that they don't want the kids on their property.\n\nFirst, property rights are a big part here. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what happens there. The neighbor kids are entering the yard without permission and leaving items behind. The author tried returning the items but found they were left there permanently. Throwing them away might be a reaction to frustration, but does that make it wrong?\n\nThen there's the communication aspect. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids there. If the neighbors didn't respect that boundary, maybe the author is justified in enforcing it strictly. However, throwing away someone else's property could be seen as extreme. Even if the items were left behind, it's technically the neighbors' belongings. The author could have tried contacting the parents again or using a different method to return the items.\n\nThe almost-physical confrontation complicates things. The neighbor dad was upset, which suggests the action was offensive. But the author might feel they've reached a breaking point given the prior issues. The key points are: ownership of the property, attempts to communicate boundaries, and the method of handling the items. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to refuse access. On the other, throwing away items could be seen as overstepping. Maybe a better approach would be to store the items and contact the parents instead of discarding them. So, is the author in the wrong? I think there's a bit of both sides, but since they've already communicated boundaries and the neighbors aren't respecting them, the author's actions might be justified. But legally and ethically, discarding someone else's property is questionable. Hmm.\n"
