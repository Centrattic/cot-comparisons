Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation involves some pre-existing tension between the families. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming through, leaving items behind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what happens there. They've communicated their boundaries, but the neighbors' kids are still entering and leaving items. The author initially tried returning the items but now disposes of them. \n\nThe key point is whether the author has the right to throw away someone else's property. Generally, if someone leaves items on your property, you can't just throw them away without notice. However, there's a nuance here: the items are left behind by trespassers. If the kids are trespassing, the author might argue that the items left are abandoned, but this isn't always legally clear. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the neighbor's dad almost came to blows over the glove. This shows the situation has escalated tensions. The author's actions, while possibly justified in their mind, could be seen as taking things too far. They did communicate their wishes, but the act of discarding items without giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve them might be considered harsh. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author wanted to prevent the kids from using their yard, so removing the items quickly is a way to deter future trespassing. But the method of disposal could be problematic. Maybe a better approach would be to store the items and give notice before disposing, but the author is frustrated and has taken a more aggressive stance.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, it's not always clear-cut. Legally, the owner might have a duty to hold onto found property for a reasonable time. However, since the items are left by trespassers, the obligation might be less. Yet, in practice, throwing away someone else's property without notice can lead to conflict, even if there's a legal justification.\n\nConsidering the neighbor's reaction and the potential for escalation, the author's actions might be seen as contributing to the problem. While the author isn't necessarily in the wrong from a property rights perspective, the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate or provocative, especially given the existing tensions.\n\nSo, balancing property rights against community relations and the specific circumstances, the author might be in the wrong in terms of social conduct, even if legally they have a point. The answer leans towards A, but with some ambiguity.\n"
