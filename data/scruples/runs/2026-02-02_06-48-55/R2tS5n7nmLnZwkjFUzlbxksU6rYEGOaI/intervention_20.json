Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about neighbors whose kids leave toys in the author's yard. The author has clearly told them not to use their yard, but the kids keep coming through and leaving stuff. The author used to throw the items back into the neighbor's yard but now just throws them away. There was even an argument with the neighbor's dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control who uses it and what's on it. If the neighbors' kids are using the yard without permission, that's an issue. The author did communicate their boundaries, so the kids shouldn't be there. But when items are left on the property, does the owner have the right to dispose of them?\n\nIn many places, if someone leaves property on your land, you might be considered a bailee (someone who holds someone else's property). That could mean you have a responsibility to store it properly or return it. Throwing it away might be seen as negligence in handling someone else's property. But if the author has given clear notice not to use their yard and the neighbors ignore that, maybe the responsibility shifts.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they used to throw the items back, which is a way of returning them. But now they just throw them away. If the neighbors aren't claiming the items and the author is trying to get rid of them, maybe there's a point where the items are considered abandoned. However, the line between abandonment and someone just forgetting might be thin here. If the items are left without permission, maybe the author isn't obligated to keep them.\n\nAnother angle is the prior issues with the kids bullying the author's children and the dog incident. There's a history of tension, which might affect how the situation is perceived. The author tried to avoid confrontation by not speaking to the neighbors but now there's a direct conflict over the glove. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, which suggests that the action of throwing away the glove was a significant issue for them.\n\nSo, if the author has given clear notice and the neighbors are still using the yard, the author's actions might be seen as defending their property. But legally, they might not be allowed to dispose of items without returning them, especially if they can be identified and claimed. The author could be in the wrong if they're not properly handling someone else's property, even if the use of the property was unauthorized.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is trying to enforce their boundaries and prevent further issues, their actions might be understandable. However, the correct approach would be to return the items or notify the neighbors rather than discarding them. So, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a line by destroying the items instead of dealing with them appropriately.\n"
