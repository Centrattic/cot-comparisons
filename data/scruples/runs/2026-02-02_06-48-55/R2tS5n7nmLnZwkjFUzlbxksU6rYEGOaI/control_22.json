Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along because of differences and past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard or leaving things there. Their own kids stay out of the neighbors' yards. However, the neighbor kids keep coming through the yard to each other's houses, playing games, and leaving items behind.\n\nThe author initially left the items but since the kids never claimed them, they started throwing them back into the neighbor's yard. Now, they just throw them away. The conflict came to a head when the neighbor dad almost had a fight with the author over a baseball glove that was thrown away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, property is private, and the owner can control what happens there. If items are left on someone's property, the owner might have the right to dispose of them if the owner has given prior notice. The author did tell the neighbors not to leave things in their yard, so maybe that's a key point.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more nuanced. The neighbors aren't friends, but the author is enforcing boundaries they set. The neighbor kids are using the yard as a path to each other's houses, which might not be the author's intention. The author is trying to protect their own space and children from past issues. However, the neighbor kids aren't their own, so there's a consideration of how to handle belongings. Throwing items away without returning them could be seen as harsh, but if the items are left unclaimed and after repeated requests, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the neighbor dad almost came to blows, which suggests that the other side feels wronged. The author's actions might be seen as reasonable from their perspective, especially given the prior issues. But others might argue that the author should have tried other means first, like contacting the parents to return items or using a neighbor service to hold them until claimed.\n\nIn AITA, the community often considers both legal rights and social expectations. The author's actions are within their legal rights if they've notified the neighbors. But socially, people might debate the harshness, especially if the items are valuable or if there's a history of conflict. However, given the context of prior issues and the author's efforts to set boundaries, many might side with the author not being in the wrong.\n"
