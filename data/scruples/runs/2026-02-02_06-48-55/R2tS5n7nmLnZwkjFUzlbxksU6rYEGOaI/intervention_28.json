Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation is that the neighbors don't get along with them, there's been some bullying issues, and the parents have a tense relationship. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still go there and leave things. The author used to put the items back but now throws them away, leading to an altercation with the neighbor dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is private property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If the items are left there without permission, the author isn't legally obligated to keep them. However, the social aspect is tricky. Even if the neighbors are problematic, disposing of someone else's property might be seen as hostile. The author did warn them multiple times, but the kids ignored those warnings. The author tried to return items before, but that didn't stop the kids. Now they're discarding the items, which could be seen as a reasonable action given the prior communication and the ongoing issue.\n\nBut maybe there's an expectation in the community to return lost items, even if you don't like the people. Throwing them away might be seen as harsh, especially if the items are valuable or sentimental. The fact that the neighbor dad got angry suggests that he felt it was wrong. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, they might be overstepping by not returning the items, even though they gave prior notice. However, since the neighbors weren't respecting the author's boundaries, this could be a justified stand to enforce their space. It's a balance between property rights and community relations. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're on their own property and tried to communicate their boundaries, but others might see it as A because of the social friction. Hmm.\n"
