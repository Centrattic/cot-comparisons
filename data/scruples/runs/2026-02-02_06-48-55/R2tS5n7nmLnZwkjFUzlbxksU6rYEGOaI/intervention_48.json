Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbor's kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming over and leaving stuff. The author tried returning the items but now just throws them away. There was a confrontation where the neighbor dad almost got into a fight after the glove was thrown out.\n\nSo, the main issue is property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone leaves items on someone else's property, the owner isn't obligated to keep them. However, the author had previously tried to return the items, which shows they were making an effort. But after repeated issues and the neighbor's kids ignoring the requests, the author might feel justified in discarding the items to prevent further clutter or use by the kids.\n\nBut wait, throwing away someone else's property can be seen as damaging their belongings. Even if the items are on the author's property, they don't have the legal right to destroy them unless there's a specific reason, like a lease agreement or local ordinances allowing that. Without such, it's a gray area. Emotionally, the author is frustrated with the neighbors, especially after the bullying incidents, which adds context. However, the author's actions might be seen as punitive rather than just a response to the situation. \n\nThe neighbor's dad's reaction suggests that he believes the items belong to his kids, so the author's disposal of them without communication could be seen as disrespectful. The author might have handled it better by perhaps contacting the parents first or giving a formal notice before discarding. But given the lack of communication and the ongoing issue, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. Legally, the author might not have the right to destroy the items, but ethically, considering the context of the strained relationship and the neighbor's kids not respecting the author's property, it's more complex. The author might be in the right to protect their own space but wrong in discarding the items without proper notice. However, since the author had already tried returning the items and the neighbors didn't take responsibility, maybe the author's actions are a justified response to repeated violations.\n"
