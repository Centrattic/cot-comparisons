Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the person throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The neighbors don't get along because of different personalities and past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has already communicated that they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. Their kids don't go into the neighbors' yards. The neighbor kids often play in the author's yard and leave items. The author initially left the items but when that didn't work, they started throwing them back into the neighbor's yard, and now just throwing them away. There was an altercation when the neighbor dad found out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has set boundaries, communicated them, and the neighbors are not respecting those boundaries. The author is removing items from their own property. Legally, if someone leaves property on your land, you might have the right to dispose of it after a certain period, but that can vary by jurisdiction. Ethically, it's about respecting others' belongings versus the right to your own property.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer based on the options given. The possible angles are: the author is protecting their property and setting boundaries, which is their right. However, throwing away someone else's belongings without notice could be seen as harsh. But since the author has already made their stance clear and the neighbors aren't respecting it, the author might feel justified. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) shows tension, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that if you own the land, you can control who is on it and what stays there. The author isn't keeping the items for themselves, just removing them. However, throwing them away could be seen as destroying property, which might be a problem. But if the items are left unclaimed and the owner is aware, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is allowed to dispose of items left on their property. Since they've communicated the issue multiple times, and the neighbors continue to leave things, the author might be within their rights. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
