Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. The neighbors don't get along with them, there's been some past issues with the kids bullying their children and a dog incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard, and the kids are still coming through, leaving items behind. The author tried leaving the items but they were never claimed, so they started moving them back, then started throwing them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor Dad almost got into a fight because the author threw away a glove.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what happens there. The neighbors' kids are entering without permission, which the author has already told them not to do. The items left in the yard are considered abandoned property legally? If the items are left on someone's property without permission, the owner can dispose of them, especially if they're not claimed. But maybe there are some nuances here.\n\nBut wait, there's a conflict here. The neighbor kids are using the yard without permission. The author has communicated their boundaries and the kids aren't respecting them. The author's actions could be seen as enforcing their property rights. However, sometimes in such situations, there's an expectation of good faith. Even if the kids are trespassing, throwing away their belongings might be seen as harsh. The neighbor Dad's reaction was intense, perhaps because he felt the author was overstepping.\n\nBut legally, the author owns the property. If someone else's items are on their land without consent, the owner can remove them. However, if the items are still usable, the owner might need to make a reasonable attempt to return them. The author tried leaving them in the yard but the items were never claimed. So maybe after a reasonable time, the author is justified in disposing of them.\n\nBut the neighbor kids are using the yard as a path, which complicates things. The author's kids aren't allowed to go over there, so the neighbor kids are essentially using the author's property as a shortcut. That's trespassing, so the author has a right to remove any items left behind. However, if the items were left intentionally, maybe the author should have tried to contact the parents first, but the author did communicate their request multiple times. The author's actions are enforcing their own space, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response to the confrontation is a problem. Throwing away items might be seen as going too far, especially if the parents weren't aware their kids were leaving things. But the author has already tried leaving the items and the parents didn't collect them. So the author's actions are a form of self-help, which might be acceptable in some jurisdictions.\n\nBut in terms of community relations, the author's actions are causing tension. The neighbor Dad's reaction suggests that the author's approach is causing conflict. Even if legally justified, the author might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not whether they should have handled it differently.\n\nIn terms of legal principles, property owners can remove trespassing items. However, if the items are left on the property, the owner might be responsible for keeping them safe until they can be returned. But if the items are considered abandoned, then disposing is acceptable. The author might be in the right legally but in the wrong socially. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they should be more polite.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions are protecting their property after clear communication. They tried to leave the items, but since they weren't claimed, disposal is reasonable. The neighbor's aggressive reaction is inappropriate, but the author's actions are justified. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
