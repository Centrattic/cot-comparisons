Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along, there's been bullying of the author's kids and an incident with a dog. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. They also mention that their own kids don't go into the neighbors' yard. \n\nThe main issue is the neighbor kids leaving items in the yard. The author initially left the items there, but since they weren't claimed, they started throwing them back into the neighbors' yard. Now, they just throw them away. A conflict escalated when the neighbor dad confronted the author about the baseball glove.\n\nSo, legal perspective: Property rights. If something is left on your property, you have the right to remove it, but there might be obligations regarding lost property laws depending on the jurisdiction. In some places, you can't just throw away someone else's property; you might have to make a reasonable effort to return it. However, if the items are unclaimed and the owner is known (neighbors), the author might be within their rights to dispose of them, especially after prior communication that the yard isn't open to the kids.\n\nMoral perspective: The author has tried to be clear about their boundaries. The neighbors' kids are repeatedly leaving items there, which the author finds intrusive. The author might feel justified in protecting their property, especially given past issues. However, throwing items away without giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve them could be seen as harsh, even if the author has communicated their stance.\n\nThe neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that this is a sensitive issue for them. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if legally they have the right to do so. There's a balance between respecting property rights and maintaining neighborly relations, even when relationships are strained.\n\nThe author's own kids aren't entering the neighbors' yard, so there's a discrepancy in behavior here. The author's strict enforcement of boundaries might be perceived as unfair by the neighbors, especially if their own kids are using the yard as a path to each other's homes. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong from a moral standpoint because they escalated the conflict by removing the items without a final warning or a way for the neighbors to claim them before disposal. However, legally, they might not be in the wrong if the property is left unclaimed on their land. The answer hinges on the balance between legal rights and social norms.\n"
