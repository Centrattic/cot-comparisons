Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with kids bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving items there. The kids keep entering the yard during games and leaving stuff. The author tried returning items but now throws them away, leading to a conflict with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and responsibility. Legally, if someone leaves property on your land, does the owner have the right to discard it? In many jurisdictions, if property is abandoned on someone else's land, the landowner might have the right to dispose of it, especially after notifying the owner. The author did mention multiple times their request for the kids to stay out and not leave items. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance here. The neighbor's kids might not have intended to abandon the items; they could just be temporarily left there. Also, the author is being proactive to prevent future issues, but the conflict escalated when the dad confronted them. Ethically, even if the author has legal rights, the social aspect matters. The neighbors might feel disrespected or that their property was handled without consideration.\n\nHowever, the author also took steps to avoid interaction, like not wanting their kids to enter the neighbors' yard. The situation is a bit of a stalemate. The key points are communication, intent, and the neighbor's response. The author tried returning items initially, which shows some effort to return them, but throwing them away after multiple incidents could be seen as a reasonable step if the neighbors are not respecting their boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's dad's reaction might be a sign that the items weren't meant to be discarded. The author's action could be seen as overstepping if the items were still in use or if there was a misunderstanding about ownership. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if the items are considered abandoned, the author might be justified. But in terms of social norms, there's a middle ground. Perhaps the author could have given more notice or tried another method before discarding. But considering the ongoing issue and the neighbor's lack of response to prior requests, the author's actions might be defendable. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author communicated their wishes and took reasonable steps to enforce their property boundaries. However, there's a slight ethical consideration, but the main issue is property rights and respecting boundaries.\n"
