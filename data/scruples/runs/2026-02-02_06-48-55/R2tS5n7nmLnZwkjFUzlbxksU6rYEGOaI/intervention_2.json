Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The background is that the neighbors don't get along, there was bullying, and the kids are leaving items in the yard. The author initially tried to return the items but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author owns their property and has set boundaries. They've communicated that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving things there. The neighbors' kids are still doing it, and the author is removing the items. The question is whether throwing away someone else's property is wrong, even if the items are left on your property.\n\nFirst, property rights. The author's yard is their property. If someone leaves items there, legally, those items are considered abandoned. But does that mean the owner can dispose of them? Maybe, but in some places, you might need to make a reasonable effort to return the items first. The author did return them initially, but now just throws them away. The neighbor reacted strongly when the glove was thrown away. \n\nAlso, the fact that there's a history of conflict complicates things. The author has a legitimate reason to not want the kids in their yard, especially given the bullying and the dog incident. But throwing away items could be seen as taking a stand, but maybe it's a bit harsh. The neighbor might feel entitled to their belongings and see the author's actions as theft or destruction of property, even if the items were left behind.\n\nThe author made clear their boundaries, but maybe they should have taken a different approach. Instead of throwing things away, maybe contacting the parents first or putting up a sign. But the author tried returning the items once, and since the kids keep doing it, the author is frustrated. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author is standing up for their property and their kids' safety. But the act of throwing away someone else's belongings, even if left on your property, can be seen as crossing a line. The neighbor's reaction might be valid if they believe the items were still theirs and the author's action was intentional to harm their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, maybe the author can dispose of abandoned items, but morally, considering the ongoing conflict and the neighbor's perspective, the author might be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. The answer could lean towards A (in the wrong) because the author's actions could be perceived as hostile, even if their intentions are to protect their property and family.\n"
