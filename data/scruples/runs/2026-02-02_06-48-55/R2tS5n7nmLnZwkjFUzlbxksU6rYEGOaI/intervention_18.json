Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along, there was some bullying and a previous incident with a dog. The author has told the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard, but the kids keep coming through and leaving stuff. The author used to put the items back but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. If the author's yard is their private property, they have the right to control who is there and what's in it. The neighbors' kids were using the yard without permission, which the author had already prohibited. The kids were leaving items, which are technically on the author's property. \n\nBut then, the items belong to the neighbors. The author is disposing of someone else's property. Even if the items were left there, if the author had already asked the neighbors not to let their kids in the yard, maybe the neighbors have a responsibility to retrieve their belongings. However, the author might argue that since the kids were trespassing, any items they left behind could be considered abandoned.\n\nBut legally, even if someone trespasses, their belongings still belong to them. The owner of the property can't just throw away another person's property without trying to return it. The author tried returning them initially, but when that didn't work, they started disposing of them. This might be where the issue lies. The neighbors might feel that the author is being vengeful or not making a good-faith effort to return the items.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that their kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so there's a one-sided situation. The author's actions might be seen as harsh because they're not reciprocating. The neighbor dad almost came to blows about the glove, which suggests that the neighbors feel wronged, even if their kids were in the yard without permission.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be justified in protecting their property and ensuring their kids aren't harmed by the neighbor kids. However, throwing away items is a form of retaliation and could be seen as taking things too far. The author could have documented the items and kept them for a period, giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve them, especially after multiple requests to stop the kids from using the yard.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for wanting to prevent the kids from using their yard, the act of throwing away the items without a proper attempt to return them could be considered in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're disposing of others' property, even if the items were left there. However, some might argue B (No) because the author has the right to their property and the neighbors should have taken responsibility for the items.\n"
