Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The neighbors don't get along, and the author has already asked the kids not to leave things in their yard. The kids keep coming through the yard, leaving items, and the author ends up throwing them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. However, the issue is whether throwing away someone else's property is acceptable. If the items are left in the yard, technically, the author could be responsible for them, but they might not have the right to dispose of them without returning them.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate their boundaries by telling the neighbors not to have their kids in the yard and not leave things. The neighbors' kids are still coming through, which complicates things. The author's response is to throw the items away after they've already tried returning them to the other yard. The conflict escalated when the neighbor dad almost came to blows over the baseball glove.\n\nLegally, the author might not own the items left in their yard, so throwing them away could be seen as destruction of another's property. Even if the author has given notice, the law often requires proper handling of found property, like returning it or holding it until the owner can claim it. Throwing them away might be against that. However, in practice, if the items are left for a long time and the owner isn't claiming them, there might be some leeway, but the author's approach is confrontational.\n\nMoral and social aspects matter too. The neighbors might feel disrespected by the author's actions, especially after a history of tension. The author's actions could be seen as justified if they've clearly communicated their wishes and the neighbors are ignoring them. But the line is thin between standing up for one's property and being overly harsh.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they destroyed property that doesn't belong to them, even if it was left in their yard. They should have tried to return them or perhaps even kept them for a while before disposal. The answer is A.\n"
