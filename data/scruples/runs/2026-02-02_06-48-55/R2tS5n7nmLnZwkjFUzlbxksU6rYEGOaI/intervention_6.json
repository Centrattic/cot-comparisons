Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The neighbors don't get along with the author's family. There were past issues with the neighbor kids bullying the author's children and a dog incident. The author has made it clear that they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yards, so there's a mutual agreement of sorts, but the neighbors' kids still use the yard as a path for their games and leave stuff.\n\nThe author initially left the items but after they were ignored, started moving them back, and now throws them away. There was a confrontation when a neighbor dad found out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider property rights and communication. The author owns the property, so they have the right to control what's on it. However, the items left behind could be considered lost property, not trash. In many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you can't just throw it away; you might have a duty to return it. But if the owner is unresponsive or refuses to claim it, there might be a process to follow, like giving notice before disposing of it.\n\nThe author has asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave things in their yard, so there's a history of communication. The neighbors didn't heed the request, and now the author is taking action. However, the author's response (throwing away items) could be seen as excessive or not following proper procedures. Throwing away someone else's property without trying to return it directly might be problematic. Even if the author moved them back initially, maybe they should have tried to contact the parents again before discarding them.\n\nAlso, the neighbor dad's reaction leading to almost a fight suggests that this is a sensitive issue. The author's approach might be seen as rude or inconsiderate, even if they have a valid complaint. While the author's boundaries are understandable, the method of enforcing them could be in question. There might be a better way to handle the situation, like a polite but firm conversation, or involving a mediator if necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they disposed of others' property without following proper steps to return or notify the owners. Even with prior communication, throwing things away could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
