Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that their neighbors' kids are leaving toys in their yard. The author has asked the neighbors multiple times not to let their kids leave things there, but the kids still do it. The author has tried moving the items back into the neighbors' yard, but now they just throw them away. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor dad when he found out a glove was thrown away.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the author is doing the right thing by discarding the toys. Well, the author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids are ignoring that and leaving stuff. The author tried to return the items, but the problem persists. Now they're throwing them out. \n\nFrom a property rights standpoint, if something is left on your property, technically you own it. But if it's someone else's belongings left there by accident or negligence, you have a responsibility to return it. However, if the owner is neglectful, maybe the obligation decreases. The author tried returning them before but the items stayed there indefinitely. Now they're just getting rid of them. \n\nBut wait, the neighbor kids are using the yard as a shortcut, which is another issue. The author has a right to control their property. If the items are left there without permission, the author isn't obligated to keep them. However, throwing them away might be seen as harsh. Maybe they could have tried another approach, like contacting the parents first or putting a sign up. \n\nThe neighbor dad got angry, which suggests that the parents might not be aware of the issue or didn't take the previous warnings seriously. The author could be seen as standing up for their property. On the other hand, discarding someone else's property without trying to return it could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the author did try returning them before. The items just stayed there. Maybe the neighbor parents aren't taking responsibility. So the author's actions could be justified as self-defense for their property. They've made their boundaries clear. The neighbors are not respecting those boundaries, so the author has a right to protect their space. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they've communicated their wishes and tried to return the items, but the neighbors didn't take action. Throwing away the items is a reasonable step after previous attempts didn't work. So answer B.\n"
