Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The neighbors have a history of conflict, including the kids bullying their own children and a prior incident with a dog. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the neighbors' kids keep coming through and leaving items.\n\nFirst, property rights: The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. If someone leaves items there, technically, those items could be considered abandoned. But there's a nuance here. The author's kids don't enter the neighbors' yard, but the neighbor kids are using the yard as a path. The author tried returning the items but eventually started throwing them away.\n\nNow, legal perspective: In many places, if someone leaves property on your land, you can't just throw it away; you should make a reasonable effort to return it. However, if the items are left repeatedly and the owner isn't responding, maybe the burden shifts. But the author did try returning some items initially.\n\nMoral/ethical angle: The author has a history of conflict. They've made their boundaries clear. The neighbors aren't respecting those boundaries despite being asked. The author's action is a reaction to ongoing disrespect. However, throwing away items might be seen as harsh, especially if the kids aren't old enough to understand the consequences. The neighbor dad almost got into a fight, which shows the tension is high.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might be overreacting, but given the prior issues (bullying, the dog incident), their actions are defensive. They're protecting their space and their kids. On the flip side, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like involving the parents to resolve the issue instead of unilateral action.\n\nIn conclusion: The author's actions are within their rights regarding property, but the morality depends on context. Since they tried returning items before and the neighbors kept ignoring the request, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
