Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The background includes some tension with the neighbors, past issues with bullying, and the author making it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep leaving items there, and the author started throwing them away, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author owns their yard, so anything left there isn't theirs. Legally, they might have the right to dispose of items left on their property, especially if the owners don't claim them. But there's also the social aspect. Even if it's legal, it's about how it's handled. The neighbors might feel disrespected or think the author is being aggressive.\n\nThe author mentioned they tried throwing the items back into the yard first, but then escalated to throwing them away. The neighbor Dad almost came to blows over the glove. The author had already asked the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard, so maybe they felt justified. But the problem is that despite the author's requests, the kids kept coming in. The author's response is to remove items, which might be seen as necessary to enforce boundaries.\n\nHowever, the neighbors might see the disposal as hostile. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so it's a one-sided issue. The author is trying to protect their property and kids from potential harm. But the act of throwing away items might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the items are expensive or sentimental to the kids. There's a balance between personal property rights and maintaining neighborly relations. The author's approach is strict, maybe to the point of being confrontational, leading to conflict. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong. Socially, it's more ambiguous. The fact that they tried to return the items first shows they tried to be polite, but escalating to disposal after repeated issues could be seen as necessary. However, the neighbor's reaction suggests it's not seen that way. The key points are the initial requests, the attempts to return items, and the escalation. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, they might be seen as overreacting, especially if the conflict led to almost physical confrontation. The answer depends on whether the focus is on property rights or social conduct. Since the question is about being in the \"wrong\" in a social context, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're protecting their property after being asked multiple times and the neighbors not respecting that.\n"
