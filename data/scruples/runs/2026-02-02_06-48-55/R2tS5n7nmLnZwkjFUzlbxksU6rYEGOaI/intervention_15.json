Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The situation involves ongoing tension between the neighbors. The writer has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in their yard or leave things there. Despite this, the kids keep coming through and leaving items. Initially, the writer left the items, but after the items stayed for a long time, they started returning them to the neighbors' yard. Now, they just throw them away.\n\nThe key points here are: the writer made their boundaries clear, the neighbors' kids are not following those boundaries, and the writer is taking action to remove the items. The question is about ownership and responsibility. The toys are the neighbors' kids', but they were left on the writer's property. Legally, if someone leaves property on your land, you have a duty to safeguard it, but after a certain period, you might be able to dispose of it if not claimed. However, the writer has tried returning the items before, but the neighbors didn't claim them. Now, they're throwing them away. \n\nThe writer's actions could be seen as reasonable if they've given the neighbors ample opportunity to claim the items. However, the neighbor dad almost came to blows, indicating that the neighbor felt disrespected. The writer might be in the wrong if they didn't give a final warning before throwing away the items. Alternatively, if they've made their stance clear multiple times and the neighbors still don't comply, the writer might not be in the wrong. There's also the aspect of the initial conflict with the kids bullying their children and the dog incident, which adds context to the tension. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while it's understandable to want to enforce boundaries, the method of disposal could be contentious. Maybe a better approach would be to hold onto the items for a longer period or use a more formal process for disposing of unclaimed property. But given the ongoing issues and the writer's clear communication, it might not be entirely their fault. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The key is whether the writer followed proper steps to return or notify before disposal. Since they tried returning before, but the neighbors didn't take them, maybe B is the answer. But the immediate throwing away without a final notice might be the issue. Hmm.\n"
