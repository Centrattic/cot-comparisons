Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids.\n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There were issues with their kids bullying the author's kids and a dog incident. The author has clearly communicated that their yard is not for the neighbors' kids. Despite this, the neighbor kids keep using the yard, leaving toys behind. The author tried returning the items but now just throws them away. One time, this led to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about the author's right to dispose of items on their property. Legally, if the items are left on the author's property, they might have the right to do with them as they please, especially if they've given notice. The author did mention they asked the neighbors not to leave things there multiple times. However, there's a social aspect too. Even if legally okay, socially, it might be seen as harsh, especially since the neighbor kids might need those toys. Also, the fact that the neighbor dad almost got into a fight suggests that this action is a sensitive point.\n\nThe author's actions could be justified if they are protecting their space and have tried other methods first (like returning the items). But the escalation to throwing away items and causing conflict might make the author seem at fault from a social standpoint. People might argue that the author should find a less confrontational way, like contacting the parents to return the items or placing them somewhere safe until claimed. \n\nThere's also the consideration of the kids' well-being. The author mentions their son is autistic, so the situation might involve protecting his environment from unexpected intrusions and potential triggers. However, that doesn't necessarily negate the neighbor's rights to their children's belongings.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not be legally wrong, the social etiquette angle and the resulting conflict could place some responsibility on them for not handling the situation more diplomatically.\n"
