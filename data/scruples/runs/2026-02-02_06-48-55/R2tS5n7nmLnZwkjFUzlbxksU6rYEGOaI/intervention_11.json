Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbors' kids are leaving toys in their yard, and the author has started throwing them away after previous attempts to return them failed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If someone else leaves items there, they aren't technically trespassing with the items, but the owner can decide to remove them. However, throwing away someone else's property might be a bit harsh.\n\nThe author did mention they asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave things in their yard. The neighbors didn't comply, so maybe the author feels justified in taking more drastic action. But is throwing them away the right approach? Maybe contacting the neighbors first or trying to return the items in a different way could be better. \n\nAlso, the neighbor dad almost came to blows, which indicates that the author's action was perceived as aggressive. Even if the author is within their rights, the way they handled it might have escalated the conflict. Perhaps there's a more diplomatic solution, like setting up a lost and found box or sending the items via mail. \n\nBut from the other side, the neighbors have been problematic, with issues like bullying and the dog incident. The author might feel justified in protecting their space. However, the key point is whether the author's action was legally or morally wrong. Legally, they can remove items from their property, but ethically, maybe there's a better approach. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but their method could be seen as harsh. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer could depend on context. Since they've made their boundaries clear and the neighbors didn't respect them, throwing the items away could be seen as self-preservation. However, escalating the conflict by being confrontational is a problem.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to their property, but they should consider a less confrontational method. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe there's a nuance. Maybe the fact that they threw it away without trying to return it again is the issue. The previous attempt was returning them, but since the neighbors didn't pick them up, maybe the author is within their rights to dispose of them. \n\nSo, final answer: B (Not in the wrong).\n"
