Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The neighbors don't get along because of various issues, including their kids bullying the author's kids and a dog incident. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come through, leaving items behind. The author initially left the items, but when that didn't work, started throwing them back, and now throws them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nNow, legal perspective: Property rights usually mean that the owner can control what happens on their land. If the toys are left on the author's property, they might have the right to dispose of them, especially if they've communicated their wishes. But there's also a social aspect. Even if legally correct, socially, it might be seen as harsh, especially after multiple warnings. The neighbor's kids might not realize the items are being thrown away, and the confrontation suggests that this is a sensitive issue.\n\nEthical considerations: The author is protecting their property and ensuring their kids' safety by keeping the neighbors' kids away. However, throwing away items could be seen as taking it too far if the neighbors are trying to retrieve them. The author might be justified in enforcing their boundaries, but the escalation to throwing things away might be crossing a line, especially if it leads to conflict.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author has the right to their property and the items left there are considered trash. They tried to be polite by leaving the items first. The neighbors' kids are trespassing, so any items they leave are fair game.\n\nBut also, maybe the author should have tried other methods first, like contacting the parents to inform them about the items, rather than just discarding them. However, the author did mention that the neighbors don't get along, so communication might be difficult.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider both legal rights and social norms. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they own the property and have communicated their wishes. However, some might argue A (in the wrong) because it's creating conflict and the neighbors might expect a different resolution.\n\nLooking at similar AITA posts, people are often not in the wrong for enforcing their property rights, especially after setting boundaries. So the answer is likely B.\n"
