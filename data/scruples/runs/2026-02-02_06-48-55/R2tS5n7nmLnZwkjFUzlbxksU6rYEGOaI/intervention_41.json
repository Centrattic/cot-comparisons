Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author is throwing them away after multiple requests for the kids to stay out.\n\nFirst, property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control who enters and what stays there. If the neighbors' kids are crossing into the yard and leaving items, that's an issue. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming in and leaving things.\n\nNow, the author used to put the items back but now throws them away. The key point here is whether throwing away the items is a reasonable response after multiple requests. The neighbors aren't respecting the author's property boundaries, so the author might feel justified in taking action. However, when the neighbor confronts them, it escalates the situation. The author's response could be seen as harsh, especially if the items are valuable to the kids. But considering the prior issues with the kids bullying and the author's efforts to keep their yard private, maybe they feel it's necessary to enforce boundaries strictly.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author might not have given the neighbors a chance to resolve the issue through dialogue. Instead, they escalated by throwing away the items, leading to conflict. But if the neighbors are uncooperative and the kids continue to leave items despite warnings, the author's actions could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nLegally, the author can control their property, but throwing away someone else's belongings might be seen as theft or disposal without notice. However, in practice, items left unclaimed might not be protected the same way. Yet, in a civil dispute, the author could be considered at fault for not giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve the items after the first few incidents. The fact that there was a confrontation where the neighbor almost came to blows suggests that the author's actions were provocative.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they escalated the situation by discarding the items, leading to direct conflict. They could have tried to communicate again or given the neighbors more time to resolve the issue. Throwing away items without a final warning might be seen as overstepping, even if the neighbors were the initial problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
