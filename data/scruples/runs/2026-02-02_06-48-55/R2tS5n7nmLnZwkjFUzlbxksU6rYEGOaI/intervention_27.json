Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The neighbors don't get along with the author's family. There's a history of issues: the neighbor's kids bullied the author's kids, and there was a conflict about a dog. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. However, the neighbor kids still come through the yard to play between each other's houses and leave items behind. The author used to leave the items but eventually started throwing them away, which led to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nNow, the key points here are ownership of the property and the items. The author's yard is their private property. If someone leaves items on private property, legally, the owner can dispose of them if they notify the person. But here, the author has already communicated that they don't want the kids in their yard, so the items are left intentionally or carelessly. \n\nThe author tried to return the items initially but now tosses them. The problem is that the items belong to the neighbors, so even if they're on the author's property, the author isn't the legal owner. However, in many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you can dispose of it after giving a reasonable notice. The author did give notice by asking the kids not to come into the yard and by previously returning the items. \n\nBut there's a conflict here. The neighbors are using the yard as a passageway to each other's houses. Maybe they have an agreement between themselves to use that path, even if the author doesn't approve. The author's kids aren't using the neighbors' yards, but the neighbors' kids are using the author's space. \n\nThe author's action of throwing away the items is a direct response to the kids' continued presence and the items left behind. While the author has the right to their property, the items belong to others. The author might not be legally in the wrong if they've given proper notice, but morally, it's a gray area. The neighbors might feel that the author is being overly strict or taking it too far by throwing away their property. \n\nAdditionally, the confrontation with the neighbor dad suggests that this is a sensitive issue. The author's actions led to almost physical conflict, which indicates that the neighbors feel wronged. The author's justification is that they've asked multiple times, but the neighbors' kids are still coming through. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, maybe not if they gave notice. Morally, it's a bit iffy because they're disposing of others' property. However, considering the prior issues with bullying and the conflict, the author might feel justified. On the other hand, throwing away items that belong to others, even if left on their property, is a form of taking control over someone else's belongings. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between property rights and respecting others' belongings. Since the author has communicated their boundaries and the neighbors are ignoring them, the author's frustration is understandable. However, throwing away the items might be seen as aggressive. The correct approach might have been to report the issue to a mediator or local authorities rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong legally but could be in the wrong morally or socially because they escalated the situation. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because while the property is theirs, the items aren't, and the action might be seen as overstepping. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check some laws. In many places, you can't just dispose of someone's property on your land without trying to return it. The author did try to return them at first but then stopped. If they didn't make a good-faith effort to return, they might be in the wrong. Since they did try to return them but then stopped, maybe it's still A. Yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
