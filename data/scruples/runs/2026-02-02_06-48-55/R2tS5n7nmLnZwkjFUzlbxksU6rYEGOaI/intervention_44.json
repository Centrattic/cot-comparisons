Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys that neighbor kids left in their yard after previous conflicts with the neighbors.\n\nFirst, the neighbors and the author don't get along. There were past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in the yard or leave items. The neighbors' kids still come through and leave stuff like baseball gloves, balls, etc. The author tried returning the items but now just throws them away. There was an altercation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, legal vs. moral? Legally, property owners have the right to control their property. If items are left on someone's property, the owner isn't legally responsible for keeping them. However, morally, there's a question of fairness. Did the author make efforts to return the items first? Yes, they tried putting them back in the neighbor's yard. Then after that, they started discarding. The neighbor's kids might not be aware they're not supposed to leave items, but the author made that clear. The author's actions are within their legal rights, but maybe the escalation from returning to discarding is where the moral line is crossed. The neighbor's dad was upset, leading to a confrontation. The author's stance is that they've been clear about their boundaries, but the neighbors are still violating them. However, throwing away items that might have sentimental value could be seen as harsh. The author's justification is protecting their kids and maintaining their space. The neighbors' kids might not understand the rules, but the parents are responsible for their children's actions. The author's actions are understandable given the prior conflict, but maybe the way they handled the situation (throwing away instead of returning) escalated the issue. It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author is right, but morally, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they set boundaries and took reasonable steps. However, the neighbor's perspective is that the author is being too strict. The answer hinges on empathy and understanding both sides. Since the author made their stance clear and tried returning items before discarding, they might not be in the wrong. But if the neighbor's items held value, the author could be seen as overstepping. Given the context, the answer might be B.\n"
