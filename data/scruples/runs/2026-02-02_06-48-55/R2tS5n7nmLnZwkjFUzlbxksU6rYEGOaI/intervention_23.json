Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves prior issues with the neighbors, including the neighbor's dog scaring the writer's autistic son, and ongoing conflicts about the kids using the yard.\n\nFirst, the key points here are property boundaries and ownership. The writer made it clear to the neighbors that they don't want their kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming through and leaving items. The writer initially tried returning the items but now throws them away. The neighbor almost got into a physical altercation because of this.\n\nThe writer's actions could be seen as enforcing their own property rights. They've communicated their boundaries, and if the neighbors are violating those by allowing their kids to leave items, the writer might feel justified in removing them. However, throwing away someone else's property, even if it's on your land temporarily, might be a legal gray area. Legally, if the items are left on the writer's property, they might have the right to keep them, but throwing them away could be considered trespassing on the neighbors' rights to their belongings.\n\nBut considering the context of prior conflicts, the writer's frustration is understandable. They've taken steps to prevent their kids from going into the neighbors' yards, so it's a two-way issue. The neighbors aren't respecting the writer's boundaries, leading to the writer's defensive actions. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that the writer's actions are perceived as aggressive, even if they feel it's justified.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the writer has a right to their property, the disposal of someone else's belongings without communication might be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like returning the items or leaving them in a specific spot, but the writer chose to discard them. This could be seen as taking it too far, especially after the initial requests to not leave things there.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the answer could be nuanced. Legally, maybe the writer isn't in the wrong if they own the property where the items were left. Morally, though, throwing things away might be seen as overstepping, especially after prior communication. The fact that the writer is trying to maintain boundaries is a point in their favor, but the method of disposal could be the issue.\n"
