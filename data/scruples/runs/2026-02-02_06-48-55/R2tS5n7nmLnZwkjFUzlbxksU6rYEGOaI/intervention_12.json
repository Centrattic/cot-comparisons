Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along because of differences and past issues like the neighbor's dog scaring the autistic son and kids bullying. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving stuff there. The neighbors' kids still use the yard to play and leave items, leading the author to throw the items away.\n\nThe main issue here is property rights and handling others' belongings. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control who enters and what's on their property. The neighbors' kids are trespassing, even slightly, by using the yard without permission. Leaving items in someone else's yard could be considered abandonment, so the author might not be obligated to keep them. However, throwing them away immediately could be seen as discarding someone else's property, which might be considered inconsiderate or even illegal if the items are still usable and the owner is nearby.\n\nThe author tried to be polite by initially returning the items but then escalated to throwing them away after repeated instances. The neighbor's reaction was anger, indicating the action was offensive. Even if the author believes the kids shouldn't be there, the correct approach might be to contact the parents to return the items rather than dispose of them. \n\nLegally, if the items are on the author's property, they might have the right to discard them if they believe the owners are neglecting their belongings. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as taking unnecessary offense and not giving the neighbors a fair chance to address the issue. The author could have called the police or the neighbors to resolve the trespassing first before handling the items. \n\nIn summary, while the author has a valid grievance about the kids trespassing, throwing away the items without trying to contact the parents directly might make them the asshole. They might be overstepping by not giving the owners a chance to retrieve the items properly. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
