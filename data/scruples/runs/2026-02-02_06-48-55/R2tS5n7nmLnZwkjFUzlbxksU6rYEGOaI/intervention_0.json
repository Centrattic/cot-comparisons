Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids.\n\nSo, the background is that the neighbors don't get along with the author. There were issues with their kids bullying the author's kids and a past incident with the neighbor's dog. The author made it clear that the neighbors' kids shouldn't be in their yard or leave things there. However, the kids still come through the yard for games and leave items. The author used to put the items back into the neighbors' yard but now throws them away. There was an almost physical altercation when a baseball glove was thrown away.\n\nHmm. The key points here are property rights and communication. The author owns their yard and has the right to control who enters and what's on their property. They've already communicated their disapproval of the kids using the yard and leaving items. The neighbors are continuing to disregard these boundaries, which the author is responding to by removing the items.\n\nBut legally, if someone leaves property on your land, you might have a duty to return it or give notice before disposing of it. However, in reality, people often don't do that, especially if there's a hostile relationship. The author might feel justified given the prior issues, but the neighbors might see the items as lost and want them back. Throwing them away could be seen as going too far, especially after a previous warning. The fact that the author had a confrontation with the neighbor suggests there was no prior agreement on handling lost items.\n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their property and enforcing their rules. On the other, the items might still belong to the kids, and the author might have a responsibility to try to return them, even if it's inconvenient. The line between reasonable enforcement and overstepping could be blurry here. Since the neighbors are not cooperative, maybe the author's actions are a form of retaliation, which complicates things. So, depending on the perspective, the author could be seen as justified in protecting their own space or as being too harsh by discarding personal items without trying to return them. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they've set clear boundaries and the neighbors aren't respecting them, but there's a counterpoint about the ownership of the items.\n"
