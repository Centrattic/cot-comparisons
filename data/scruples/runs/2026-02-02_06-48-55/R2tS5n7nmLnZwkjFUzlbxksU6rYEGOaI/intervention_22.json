Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves some past conflicts between the families, including bullying and a disagreement about a dog.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep entering and leaving items. The author initially left the items, but when that didn't work, started moving them back, then eventually started throwing them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor dad got angry about the glove being thrown out.\n\nLegally, if the items are on your property, you have the right to dispose of them, especially if they're abandoned. But there's a social aspect too. Even if legally okay, the author's actions might be seen as harsh, especially since the items might be valuable to the kids. The initial communication was clear, but maybe the author could have tried another method, like a note or contacting the parents directly instead of discarding the items. The fact that the parents were already hostile might add context, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. Throwing away items without returning them could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author isn't at fault legally. So, while the author's intent was to protect their property, the method might be considered wrong in terms of neighbor relations.\n"
