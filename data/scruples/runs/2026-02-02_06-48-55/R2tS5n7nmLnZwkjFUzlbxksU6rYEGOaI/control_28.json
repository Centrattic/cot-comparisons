Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The background is that the neighbors don't get along with them, there's been some bullying, and the neighbor's dog scared their autistic kid. They've made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving stuff there.\n\nThe user didn't mention if they warned the neighbors first. Wait, they did say they made it clear multiple times. The neighbors' kids still leave things there. The person started by leaving the items there, but since they stayed forever without being claimed, they started throwing them back into the neighbors' yard, and now just throw them away.\n\nSo, the main issue is ownership. If the items are on the user's property, does the user have the right to dispose of them? Legally, property owners usually have the right to remove items left on their land, especially if they're considered abandoned. But there might be a responsibility to notify the owner first. However, in this case, the user has already tried to return them by putting them back in the yard, but now just throws them away. The neighbor dad got angry when the baseball glove was thrown out.\n\nBut the user did communicate their boundaries clearly. The neighbors' kids aren't following those boundaries. The user isn't taking the items for themselves, just disposing of them. Since the items are left in the yard (implying abandonment), the user's action might be justified. However, there's a possible legal nuance here. In some jurisdictions, you can't just throw away someone else's property; you have to make a reasonable effort to return it. The user tried returning them by placing back in the yard, which might be considered reasonable. But when the items are still left there, maybe they can be considered abandoned.\n\nAnother angle: the user's intent is to enforce their boundaries because of past issues. The neighbors aren't respecting the user's space, so the user is trying to protect their own property. But the neighbor's reaction suggests that they didn't expect the items to be thrown away. The user might be seen as overreacting, especially if the items were not in a place where the kids would leave them intentionally. However, the user has tried multiple times to address it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be in the wrong because they set clear boundaries and tried to be reasonable, but the line is thin. If the items were clearly abandoned after repeated notices, then disposal is acceptable. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
