Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along, there was some bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave items.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, if items are on your property, you can dispose of them, right? But there might be nuances. Socially, even if you have the right, it's about how it's handled. The author mentions they first left the items but then started returning them, and now just throwing them away. The neighbor got upset, leading to a near confrontation.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they asked the neighbors not to leave things in their yard. The neighbors didn't comply, so the author is taking action. But maybe the author could have tried other methods first, like contacting the parents to return the items. Throwing them away without communication might be seen as harsh, especially since the items might have value to the kids. The fact that the neighbor almost came to blows suggests that the action was offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their property and might feel that the kids are trespassing and creating a mess. But the author's kids aren't doing the same, so it's a bit one-sided. The key here is whether the author gave the neighbors enough notice and handled it in a reasonable way. The author did mention they asked multiple times, but maybe not in a documented way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, possibly not, but socially, it's a gray area. The neighbors might feel disrespected, especially if the items are valuable. The author could be seen as taking it too far by throwing away the items without trying to return them through the parents again. The initial approach was to return them to the neighbors' yard, but maybe that wasn't effective, and escalating to disposal is seen as too harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to enforce their property boundaries, but the action of throwing away the items might be seen as disproportionate, especially after multiple warnings. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because while they have a point about the property, the method of disposal is considered rude or excessive.\n"
