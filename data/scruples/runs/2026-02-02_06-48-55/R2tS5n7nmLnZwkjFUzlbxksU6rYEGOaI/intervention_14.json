Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left by the neighbor's kids in their yard.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has a contentious relationship with their neighbors. There were past issues like bullying and a dog incident. They've made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids use the yard for games and leave items. The author tried moving the items back but now just throws them away. One incident led to a confrontation.\n\nSo, legally, if someone leaves property on another's land, the owner has the right to dispose of it. But morally and socially, it's different. The author's neighbors might feel entitled to retrieve the items since they're their kids' belongings. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive, especially after the initial warnings. However, the neighbors didn't respect the author's boundaries by letting the kids use the yard. The author might feel justified in enforcing their space, but throwing away items without notice could be harsh. It's a conflict of boundaries and respect. The author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate, but given the neighbors' past behavior, maybe they're protecting their space. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards A because the items belong to others, and even if there's conflict, discarding them without trying to return or notify them could be seen as wrong.\n"
