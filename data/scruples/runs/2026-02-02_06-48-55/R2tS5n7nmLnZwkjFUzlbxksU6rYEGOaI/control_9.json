Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who threw away their neighbor's toys is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbors have a bad relationship with the author. The kids from both sides don't play together much, and there's been some bullying. The author told the neighbor to keep their dog leashed after it scared their autistic son. They also made it clear that the neighbor's kids shouldn't hang out in their yard. Despite that, the kids leave toys in the yard. The author used to leave the items but now throws them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor Dad.\n\nFirst, property rights are important here. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what happens on their property. If the neighbors' kids are trespassing and leaving items, the author can ask them to stay out. If they ignore the requests, the author might feel justified in removing the items. However, throwing away someone else's property could be seen as extreme. Maybe they should try other methods first, like returning the items or contacting the parents.\n\nBut the author did mention they asked multiple times, and the kids kept entering. So the author's actions might be a response to repeated violations. The key points are: ownership of the yard, communication of boundaries, and the neighbor's failure to respect those boundaries. If the items are left in the yard, they might become abandoned property. However, the author's decision to discard them could be seen as harsh, but given the context, maybe it's understandable. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong if they've made their limits clear and the neighbors kept trespassing. But legally, tossing someone's belongings without notice could be an issue. However, since they've already had confrontations, the author's actions might be justified as self-defense of their property. So the answer might be B (No), but there's some nuance here.\n"
