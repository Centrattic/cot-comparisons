Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about neighbors whose kids leave toys in the yard. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through and leave stuff. The author initially left the items there, but since they weren't claimed, they started taking them back to the neighbors' yard. Now, they just throw the toys away. The neighbor got angry when one of the items was thrown away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so anything left on it is technically on their land. But the items belong to the neighbors' kids. So, does the author have the right to dispose of someone else's property? That might be a legal question. Legally, you can't just throw away someone else's belongings without notice, especially if there's a chance they might come to claim them. But the author says they asked the neighbors multiple times to not leave things there. \n\nThere's also the issue of prior communication. The author made their boundaries clear. The neighbors' kids are going through the yard anyway despite the author's wishes. The author tried returning items but that didn't work, so they switched to throwing them away. The problem here is that throwing away the items might be seen as going too far, even if the neighbors aren't respecting the boundaries. \n\nAnother angle is the relationship between the neighbors. They don't get along, and there's been past issues like bullying. The author's actions might be motivated by frustration. However, even in a bad relationship, there are social and legal norms about handling others' property. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, which suggests the action was perceived as hostile. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have given more notice or documented the attempts to return items. Maybe leaving a note or contacting the parents first. But the author says they tried returning items but that didn't work. Still, throwing away items without any prior communication (except the initial requests) might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they disposed of others' property without a proper process. Even if they asked the kids not to leave things, once the items are left, the author can't just throw them away. They might need to contact the parents to retrieve the items, even if it's inconvenient. The author's actions could be seen as trespassing on the neighbors' rights. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the author did try to enforce their boundaries. However, the act of throwing away might be the problem. So leaning towards A.\n"
