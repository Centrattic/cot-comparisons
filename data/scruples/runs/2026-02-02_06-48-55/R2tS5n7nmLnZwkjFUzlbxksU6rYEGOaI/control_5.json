Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys that neighbor kids left in their yard. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The neighbors don't get along, there were issues with their kids bullying the author's kids, and a prior incident with the dog. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The author's kids don't go to the neighbors' yard, but the neighbors' kids come through, play games, and leave items. The author initially left the items but then started moving them back, and now throws them away. There was an altercation when the neighbor dad found out about the glove being thrown away.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author has communicated their boundaries, the neighbors are ignoring those boundaries, and the author is taking action to remove items left on their property. \n\nOwnership of the items is a factor. Since the toys are left on the author's property, the author might have the right to dispose of them, especially if the neighbors aren't claiming them. However, maybe there's an expectation that if something is lost, the owner can come back for it. But the author mentions that the items stayed there indefinitely without being claimed, so maybe they have a right to get rid of them after a reasonable time.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the neighbors not respecting the author's space. The author tried to be polite by moving the items back, but when that didn't work, they escalated to throwing them away. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, but the author was clear about their stance. \n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, property owners can generally remove items left on their property if they're considered abandoned. However, the neighbor might argue that the items are not abandoned and that the author is being inconsiderate. But given the prior issues (bullying, the dog incident), the author might feel justified in being strict about boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author has made their position clear and the neighbors are repeatedly not respecting that, then the author isn't necessarily wrong in protecting their property. However, some might argue that throwing away items is harsh, especially if the kids didn't mean to leave them. But considering the context, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
