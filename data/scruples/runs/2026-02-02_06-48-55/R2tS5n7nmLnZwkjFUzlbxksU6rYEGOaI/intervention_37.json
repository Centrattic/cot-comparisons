Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a history of conflict with their neighbors. The neighbors' children have been bullying the author's kids, and there was an incident where a dog scared the author's autistic son. The author has made it clear that they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard or leaving items there. However, the kids still walk through the yard during games and leave things behind. The author used to leave the items but now throws them away, which led to an argument with the neighbor dad.\n\nNow, the key points here are ownership and communication. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what happens there. They have communicated their boundaries multiple times. The neighbors' kids are not supposed to be there, yet they keep entering and leaving items. The author is removing items from their property, which they own, so that's a right. However, the neighbors might argue that the items belong to their children, and throwing them away could be seen as damaging or discarding property without consent. \n\nBut considering the prior communication and the fact that the author has already tried options like returning the items back to the neighbors' yard before throwing them away, the escalation to throwing them away might be seen as reasonable under the circumstances. The neighbors allowed their kids to enter a private property despite being told not to, so the author is enforcing their boundaries. However, there might be a legal angle if the items are considered someone else's property. In many jurisdictions, if you find someone else's property on your land, you should return it or leave it for them to retrieve, not dispose of it. So if the author is legally supposed to return lost items, discarding them could be an issue. But if the items were left there intentionally, and the owner isn't claiming them, maybe it's different. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to almost a physical altercation, which complicates things. While the author's intent was to enforce boundaries, the method might be seen as confrontational. However, the neighbors also have a responsibility to keep their kids from entering private property.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether discarding items is legally permissible when someone else's property is found on your land. If the law requires you to make a reasonable effort to return lost property, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the items were just left there and not claimed after being returned, maybe it's justifiable. Given that the author tried returning them before, but now throws them away, maybe the legal duty is not being fulfilled. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if they are legally obligated to return lost items rather than dispose of them.\n"
