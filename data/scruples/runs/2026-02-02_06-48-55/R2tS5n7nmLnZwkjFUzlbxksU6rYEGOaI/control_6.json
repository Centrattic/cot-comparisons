Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with their kids bullying the author's kids, and the author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The kids still come over and leave items behind.\n\nThe author tried leaving the toys initially, but they were never picked up. Then they started moving them back to the neighbor's yard, but now they just throw them away. There was an argument about a baseball glove. The key points are property rights and the prior communication from the author.\n\nLegally, the author owns their yard, so items left there could be considered abandoned. But ethically, maybe they should make more effort to return them, especially if there's a way to do so without confrontation. However, the neighbors have been problematic, and the author has made their boundaries clear. The kids aren't supposed to be there, so maybe the author isn't at fault for not keeping items that were left by kids who shouldn't be there. \n\nAlso, the author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so there's a consistent boundary. The neighbors' kids are the ones overstepping. The author did try to return items before, but after repeated issues, it's understandable they'd get frustrated. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong. They've communicated their wishes and the neighbors aren't respecting that, leading to the author protecting their property. The answer might be B (No).\n"
