Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves a contentious relationship with the neighbors, past issues with the kids bullying their own children, and a previous incident with a dog.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come over and leave stuff. The author tried to return items but now throws them away. When confronted, the neighbor almost had a fight. \n\nLegally, the author owns their property, so they have the right to remove items left on their land. But there's a social aspect here. Even if it's their property, the neighbors might feel it's their kids' belongings. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the items are valuable or sentimental. \n\nThe author did ask multiple times for the kids not to leave things, so they're following up on their own boundaries. However, throwing away items might be harsh. Returning them might be a better approach, even if the neighbors are annoying. Throwing them away could escalate tensions, especially since the neighbor had a confrontation. \n\nEmotionally, the author might be frustrated due to past issues. But the neighbors could view this as a lack of respect. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as reasonable for property management or as overstepping. \n\nConsidering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong. Socially, it's debatable. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, there's an argument both ways. However, given the context of the author's clear boundaries and the neighbors' repeated disregard, some might side with the author. Others might say that even with boundaries, throwing away items is too extreme. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action of throwing away is seen as reasonable. Since the author tried returning them before and the neighbors didn't retrieve them, maybe throwing away is acceptable. But the confrontation suggests it's hurtful. The community might split, but the author isn't entirely wrong. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
