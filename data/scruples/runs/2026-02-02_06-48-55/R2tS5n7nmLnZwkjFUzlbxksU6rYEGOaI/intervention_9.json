Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kids leaving toys in the author's yard after being told not to. The author used to leave the toys there, but now just throws them away, leading to a conflict with the neighbor's dad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The neighbors don't get along with the author. There's a history of their kids bullying the author's children, and a past incident where a dog scared the author's autistic son. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things. Despite this, the kids still come through, play in the yard, and leave items. The author initially left the toys but after they were never claimed, started throwing them away. This led to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for throwing away the toys? Let's think about property rights. If the author owns the property, they have the right to control what's there. The neighbor's kids are leaving items on the author's land without permission, and the author has been clear that they don't want the kids there. If the items are left unattended, they might be considered abandoned, which gives the property owner the right to dispose of them. However, in some places, there could be laws about abandoned property and how long you have to keep it before you can throw it away. But the user is more interested in the moral aspect here, not just legalities.\n\nThe author's actions are a response to prior conflicts and the kids not respecting their boundaries. The neighbor's dad coming to blows suggests high tension. The author's justification is that they've asked multiple times and the kids continue, so they're taking a stand. However, the neighbor's kids might still see the author's yard as a common area, especially if they're moving between their houses. Throwing the toys away might be seen as harsh, but the author has had issues with their children before. The fact that the author's own kids don't go into the neighbors' yards shows they're trying to respect the other side's boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have given the neighbor's kids a chance to claim the items first, even if they didn't. Or perhaps there's a more diplomatic way to handle it without escalating. But since the author has already been very clear and the kids aren't heeding the requests, the author might feel justified in taking stronger action. The neighbor's dad might not be aware of the prior incidents, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nSo, considering the context of the bad relationship and the author's attempts to enforce boundaries, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the toys are the neighbor's property left on the author's land, there's a gray area. However, the author's right to their own property and the neighbor's repeated disregard for that might tip the scales in the author's favor. The answer is probably B (No), but I need to check if my reasoning holds.\n"
