Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbor's kids. The neighbors don't get along with them because of past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The person made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, but the kids keep coming through and leaving stuff. They tried leaving the items but it didn't work, then tried putting them back in the neighbor's yard, and now just throw them away.\n\nFirst, property rights come into play here. The person owns their yard, so they have the right to control who uses it and what's on it. They've communicated their boundaries clearly, and the neighbors aren't respecting them by letting their kids use the yard and leave items. The person isn't keeping the items; they're discarding them. But maybe there's a nuance here. \n\nHowever, throwing away property that belongs to someone else could be an issue. Even if the items are left in their yard, they technically belong to the neighbors. The person might be right in enforcing their boundaries by removing the items, but throwing them away might be seen as taking ownership or destroying someone else's property. That could be considered wrongful if the neighbors didn't give permission for the items to be discarded. \n\nBut the key here is that the neighbors are not respecting the person's space. The person tried multiple approaches: ignoring, returning items, and finally disposal. Since the neighbors are using the yard without permission, the person might argue that any belongings left are trespassing items. In some jurisdictions, you can remove trespassing items but not necessarily dispose of them. However, if they have no way to return them and the neighbors aren't claiming them, maybe the person's actions are understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the person could be seen as taking it too far by destroying the items. The neighbor's dad was upset about the glove, leading to a confrontation. The person might be in the wrong for not giving the neighbors a chance to collect the items first, but they did mention trying to return them. The problem is the neighbors aren't following up. \n\nSo, there's a balance between property rights and ownership. The person has the right to keep their yard free, but discarding others' property might be crossing a line. However, given the context of the neighbors not respecting boundaries and the items being left without permission, the person might be justified in removing them. But legally, throwing them away could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually return lost items or leave them for the owner to retrieve, not throw them away. So maybe the person is in the wrong socially, even if they're trying to enforce their boundaries. But if the items are considered abandoned after multiple attempts to return, the person might be justified. \n\nI think the answer is a mix, but since the question is a yes or no, I need to decide. The person is not in the wrong for protecting their property from trespassing and removing unclaimed items after attempts to return them. However, throwing them away could be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe they're justified. So the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
