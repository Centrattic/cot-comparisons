Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The neighbors don't get along with the author, and there have been issues with the kids bullying the author's children. The author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in their yard or leave things there. Despite this, the kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author initially left the items but eventually started throwing them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nLegal perspective: Property ownership is a key point here. As the owner of the property, the author has the right to control what happens on their land. If items are left on their property without permission, the owner isn't necessarily obligated to keep them. However, throwing away someone else's belongings might be seen as trespassing or possibly theft, depending on local laws. But in many jurisdictions, if someone leaves property on your land, you can dispose of it if it's not claimed after a reasonable time.\n\nEthical perspective: The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids continue to use the yard, which could be seen as disregarding the author's wishes. The author's actions might be seen as a response to protect their space and safety, especially considering the past issues with the dog and bullying. However, some might argue that throwing away items is harsh and could escalate tensions.\n\nSocial norms: People generally expect to be able to ask others not to enter their property. If the neighbors are ignoring those requests, the author has a right to enforce boundaries. Throwing away items that are left behind could be seen as a reasonable step after repeated violations. However, the confrontation with the neighbor indicates that this is a sensitive issue, and the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The neighbors might claim they have a right to use the yard if it's part of a common area or if there's a history of mutual use. Also, the items might belong to the kids, and the parents might feel entitled to retrieve them. The author's actions could be seen as punitive rather than a simple cleanup.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a legal basis for the author's actions, the ethical and social aspects might make some people side with the neighbors. However, the author's right to control their property and the prior issues with the neighbors could justify their actions. The answer likely depends on how strict the community's norms are regarding property and neighborly conduct.\n"
