Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with kids bullying and a dog incident. The author has set boundaries, telling the neighbors not to let their kids hang out in the yard or leave things. The kids still do it, and the author moves the items back or throws them away. Now, a confrontation happened when the neighbor dad found out about the baseball glove being thrown away.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their property, so technically, they can control what's left there. But the items in question belong to the kids, right? So even though they're on the author's property, the items are someone else's. The author is disposing of others' belongings, which might be the issue.\n\nBut wait, the author tried to return the items before, but the neighbors never claimed them. So maybe they were abandoned. However, the neighbor dad still might feel entitled to those items. The line here is between respecting property and the ownership of the items. If the items are left unattended on someone else's property, does the property owner have the right to dispose of them? That's a legal question. \n\nIn many places, if someone leaves items on your property and you've made efforts to return them (like putting them back in their yard), but they don't take them, you might have a right to dispose of them after a certain period. But this is after multiple attempts. The author said they used to leave them there, but now throw them away. The neighbor dad's reaction suggests that he still wants them, so maybe the author didn't give enough time to retrieve them. \n\nAlso, the author has a history of not getting along. The neighbor kids are using the yard as a path, which could be seen as trespassing. But even so, the items are still theirs. The author is taking ownership by disposing of them, which could be considered theft or negligence in returning property. \n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author has valid reasons for not wanting the kids in their yard, throwing away the items might be crossing a line. They could have notified the parents first, given a final warning, or tried to store the items temporarily. Disposing without notice might be inconsiderate, even if the property is theirs. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they disposed of someone else's property without a clear process or communication, leading to conflict.\n"
