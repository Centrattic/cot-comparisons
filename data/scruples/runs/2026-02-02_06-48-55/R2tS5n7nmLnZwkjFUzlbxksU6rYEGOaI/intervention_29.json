Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves a long-standing conflict between the neighbors. The main points are that the neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with their kids bullying the author's kids, and the author has made it clear that the neighbor kids shouldn't be in their yard. Despite this, the neighbor kids keep coming into the yard and leaving items behind.\n\nThe author initially tried to return the items but now throws them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost came to blows over the thrown-away glove. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control who enters and what items are left there. Since they've communicated their boundaries clearly, the neighbors' kids should be aware. However, when items are left on the property, the author's responsibility might be to take reasonable steps to return them, not just discard them. Throwing away property could be seen as trespassing or damaging someone else's belongings, even if those items were left behind.\n\nBut there's also the context of the hostile relationship and the prior issues with the kids. The author might feel justified in protecting their space, especially after repeated violations. However, the act of throwing away items could be seen as going too far, especially if the items can be returned to the owners. The key here is whether the author gave the neighbors a chance to retrieve the items before disposing of them. The author mentioned they used to leave the items, but since the neighbors never claimed them, they started throwing them away. However, even if the items are left unclaimed, the owner (the neighbor kids) might still have a claim to them, and the author could be liable for destruction of property.\n\nIn legal terms, in many places, if someone leaves property behind on your land, you have a duty to safeguard it until it can be returned or until the owner is notified. Simply throwing it away without making a reasonable effort to return it could be problematic. The author's action of throwing away the items might be seen as an overreaction, especially when there's a clear way to return them (like placing them in the neighbor's yard). However, the neighbor dad reacted aggressively when the glove was thrown away, which adds complexity.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because they destroyed someone else's property, even if it was left unclaimed. The appropriate action would be to either return the items or hold onto them for a reasonable time. Throwing them away without that step could be seen as not in the right. However, the hostile situation might mitigate some responsibility, but legally, ownership of the items still matters.\n"
