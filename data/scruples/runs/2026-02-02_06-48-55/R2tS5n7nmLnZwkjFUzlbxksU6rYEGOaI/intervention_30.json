Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves some tension between the families.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear they didn't want the neighbor kids in their yard or leaving things there. The kids kept coming in and leaving items despite being told. The author initially tried leaving the items, but when that didn't work, they started throwing them away. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about property rights and the right to dispose of items left on one's property. Generally, if someone leaves property on your land without permission, the owner of the land can dispose of it. But there might be some nuances here. The author did warn the neighbors, so they had a chance to avoid the issue. But the neighbor kids kept coming in, leading to repeated problems. \n\nHowever, the author could have tried other steps first, like contacting local authorities or posting signs. But given that they've tried moving the items back and that didn't work, throwing them away might be seen as a reasonable next step. The fact that the neighbors aren't on good terms adds to the tension, but if the author is within their legal rights, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a more considerate approach. Even though the author is within their rights, the way they handled it could be seen as harsh, especially since the items belong to kids. However, the author did communicate their boundaries, and the neighbors didn't respect them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong legally or morally because they've set clear boundaries and the neighbors kept violating them. The answer could be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no legal obligation to return lost property. Some places require reporting lost items to authorities before disposing of them. If the author didn't do that, maybe they are in the wrong. But the question doesn't mention that. Assuming the author is in a place where they can dispose of items left on their property after reasonable attempts to return them, then B is the answer.\n"
