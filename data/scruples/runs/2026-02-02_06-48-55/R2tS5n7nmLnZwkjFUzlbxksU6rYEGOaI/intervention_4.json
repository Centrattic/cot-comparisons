Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor throwing away toys left in their yard by the other neighbors' kids.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying, and the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author used to leave the items but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation with the neighbor's dad.\n\nSo, the main question is about the author's right to dispose of items left on their property. Legally, if something is left on your property, you might have the right to discard it, especially if it's considered abandoned. But there might be nuances. For example, if the items are valuable or if there's a dispute, the owner could potentially claim ownership. However, in this case, the author has already tried returning the items before, and the neighbors didn't claim them. Now, after multiple requests for the kids to stay out, the author is taking a stricter approach.\n\nThe author's perspective: They've set boundaries, made it clear, and the neighbors are not respecting them. The kids keep coming, leaving things behind. The author feels justified in getting rid of the items since the owners aren't retrieving them. The neighbor's dad was upset, but maybe the author sees this as a necessary step to enforce their space.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's dad might feel that the author is being too harsh, especially if the items were left unintentionally. However, the author has made their stance clear. The key points are: the author owns the property, they've communicated their boundaries, and the items are left there repeatedly. The legal right to discard abandoned items is a factor here. But there's also the social aspect\u2014how to handle conflicts with neighbors. Throwing away someone else's property might escalate tensions, even if the author feels justified.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014bullying, previous incidents with the dog, and the author's efforts to keep their kids out\u2014maybe the author is within their rights. The answer might depend on whether the items are considered abandoned. If the neighbors never claimed them, the author might be able to dispose of them. However, there's a social expectation to perhaps return the items or at least try to contact the owners. The author tried putting them back into the neighbor's yard, but that didn't work. Now, they're just throwing them away. The confrontation suggests that the neighbors might not be happy, but legally, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the possible answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any legal obligation to return lost property. In some places, you have to make a reasonable effort to find the owner. If the author did that (like placing them back in the yard), maybe they've done enough. If the items are left without any attempt to retrieve them, discarding might be acceptable. Therefore, the author might be in the right.\n"
