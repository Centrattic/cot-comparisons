Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The situation is complicated by existing tension between the families. The author has already told the neighbors not to let their kids come into the yard, but the kids keep doing it and leaving items. The author tried leaving the items but they stayed there forever, so they started throwing them back and now just throw them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. If the neighbors' kids leave items there, they're technically on the author's property. The author isn't obligated to keep those items. However, the neighbors might argue that the items belong to them and that the author should return them. But since the author has already communicated that they don't want the kids in the yard in the first place, maybe the author feels justified in removing the items to prevent future issues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, so there's a sense of fairness. The neighbors' kids are the ones entering without permission. The author tried returning the items but that didn't work, so now they just throw them away. The neighbor Dad almost came to blows over the glove, which shows the tension is high.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land, you can either return it or dispose of it, but you might want to make sure you're not keeping it for yourself. Since the author is throwing them away instead of keeping, that's probably okay. But maybe the neighbors feel disrespected, especially since the items were from their kids. The author's actions could be seen as punitive, especially after the prior conflicts.\n\nEthically, even if the author has the legal right, the social aspect is tricky. The neighbors might see it as the author being spiteful, especially given the existing bad relations. The author's reasoning is that they've asked multiple times and the problem persists, so they're taking action to enforce their boundaries. But maybe there's a middle ground, like giving the items to charity or a local school instead of just throwing them away, but the author might not want to do that.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on rights vs. social responsibility. Legally, the author is probably okay, but socially, it's a gray area. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the context of prior communication and the items being left on their property, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to protect their property and set boundaries, even if it leads to tension.\n"
