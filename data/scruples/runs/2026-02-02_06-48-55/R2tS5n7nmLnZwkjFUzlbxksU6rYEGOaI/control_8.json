Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. There's a history of not getting along with the neighbors, some bullying issues, and the author has clearly told the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming through, leaving stuff, and the author has gone from returning items to just throwing them away. One of the neighbors got angry about this.\n\nHmm. The author's property is their own, so they have the right to control what's on it. They've communicated their boundaries, which is important. The neighbors' kids are trespassing, even if it's just walking through. The author is removing items left on their property, which they own once they're on the author's land. But maybe there's a nuance here. If the items were left by mistake or temporarily, maybe the author could return them. However, the neighbors didn't claim the items, and the author tried returning them before. Now they're just getting rid of them. The question is whether throwing them away is justified.\n\nLegally, the author owns anything on their property, so they can dispose of it. But morally, maybe there's a consideration for the kids who might have lost the items. However, given the ongoing issues and the neighbors not respecting boundaries, the author is protecting their space. The fact that they tried to return the items first shows they tried to be considerate. The neighbors' reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests they didn't appreciate the author's actions, but the author's stance is about maintaining their own space. So probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
