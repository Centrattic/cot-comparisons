Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation involves some history of conflict between the families, including the neighbor's dog scaring the author's autistic son and bullying of the kids. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving items there. Despite this, the neighbor's kids keep coming through and leaving things. The author went from leaving the items to throwing them back and now just throwing them away, leading to an altercation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership and communication. The author's property is their own, so they have the right to control what happens on it. If the neighbors are not supposed to be in the yard and their kids are doing that, then the items left behind could be considered as abandoned on the author's property. However, the legal aspect might come into play here. When someone abandons property on your land, you can dispose of it after a reasonable time. But how long is reasonable? The author mentions that items stayed there indefinitely without being claimed. So maybe after multiple warnings and the items not being retrieved, throwing them away is within their rights. \n\nBut there's also the interpersonal aspect. Even if legally they might be justified, the neighbor might feel wronged because those items belong to them. The author's actions could be seen as hostile, especially since there's already existing tension. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, which shows the situation is escalated. The author's approach of just throwing things away might be perceived as aggressive, especially without a prior notice to the parents. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. If the parents are aware and still allow their kids to enter, then they might share some responsibility. The author might be within their rights to remove the items as they see fit, but the method could be problematic. Maybe returning the items or contacting the parents first would have been better to avoid conflict. \n\nSo, considering both legal and social perspectives, the author might not be in the wrong legally but could be in the wrong socially. However, the answer depends on the jurisdiction's laws regarding abandoned property. Since the question is about right and wrong in a real-life context, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if they followed proper procedures (like giving warnings and then disposing after a reasonable time). But since they escalated by immediately throwing things away without returning them, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Still, given the prior issues, some might argue the author is justified in protecting their property.\n"
