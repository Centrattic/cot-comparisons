Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor throwing away toys that were left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The main points are that the neighbors don't get along, there were past issues like bullying and a dog incident, and the author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids come into their yard. Despite that, the kids keep entering and leaving items. The author used to return the items but now throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their private property. If someone leaves items there, technically, the owner of the property can dispose of them if not claimed. But there might be nuances. In some places, you have to make a reasonable effort to return lost items before discarding them. However, the author says they've asked multiple times for the kids not to enter the yard and not to leave things. If the neighbors were aware of this and still left items, maybe the author is within their rights. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the relationship. The neighbors don't get along, which complicates things. The author's actions, like throwing away items, might be seen as confrontational. Even if legally they can do it, socially, it's a poor move because it escalates tension. The author's justification is that they've made their boundaries clear, so the neighbors shouldn't expect the items to be kept. However, maybe the author could have tried other methods first, like contacting the parents to return the items instead of just throwing them away. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the law allows disposal of unclaimed items on one's property, then maybe not. But if there's a community expectation to return lost items or if the author's actions are overly aggressive given the circumstances, it might be considered wrong. The fact that there was a near-physical altercation suggests that the action crossed a line. Also, throwing away items might be seen as not giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve them, even if they've been warned. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, you might need to give a reasonable period for someone to claim lost property before disposing of it. If the author just throws them away immediately, that could be an issue. However, the user mentions that the items were left \"for infinity\" before, so maybe there was a pattern of neglect. Still, the act of throwing away someone else's property can be legally and socially problematic, especially if done without notice. \n\nConsidering all factors, while the author might have a valid gripe about the kids entering their yard and not respecting their wishes, the solution of discarding items could be seen as excessive. The confrontation with the neighbor dad shows that this action is causing more conflict. Perhaps a middle ground, like returning the items but not allowing the kids to use the yard, would be better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for handling it that way.\n"
