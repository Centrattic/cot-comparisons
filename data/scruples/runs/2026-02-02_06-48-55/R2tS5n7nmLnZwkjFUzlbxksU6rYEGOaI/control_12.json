Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the neighbors don't get along, there's been bullying, and the author has set boundaries about their kids not being in their yard. The author has told the neighbors not to let their kids hang around or leave things. The neighbors' kids still leave items, so the author starts throwing them away. One incident led to a confrontation with the neighbor dad.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The key points are property rights and respecting boundaries. If the author made it clear that their yard is off-limits and they don't want the kids there, then the neighbors' kids are trespassing by entering. However, even if they're trespassing, the items left behind might still belong to the neighbors. The author has the right to their property but shouldn't necessarily take the neighbors' belongings without returning them, even if there's bad relations. \n\nBut the author claims they asked multiple times. Maybe the neighbors aren't taking that seriously. However, legally, if someone leaves personal property on your land, you can't just throw it away. You should return it or notify the owner. The author might be overstepping by disposing of items, even if there's conflict. There's also the aspect of trying to resolve the issue through other means, like involving the police or a mediator, rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nBut the tension here is that the author is trying to protect their space and their children. The neighbors aren't respecting the boundaries, so the author might feel justified. However, the act of throwing away someone else's property is generally not acceptable, regardless of the relationship. The answer might lean towards AITA, but depends on cultural norms and legal perspectives. In many jurisdictions, you can't just discard someone's belongings, even if they're on your property without permission. They should be returned or held for a reasonable time. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they're taking possession of items that aren't theirs. Even if the kids are trespassing, the items are still the neighbors'. So the correct action would be to return them or contact the neighbors rather than throw them away. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
