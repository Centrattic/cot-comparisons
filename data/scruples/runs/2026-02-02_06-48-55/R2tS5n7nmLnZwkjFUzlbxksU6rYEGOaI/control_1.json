Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation is that the neighbors don't get along, there's been past issues with the kids bullying their kids, and the author has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang around their yard.\n\nThe author mentions that their kids don't go into the neighbors' yard, but the neighbor kids do enter and leave items. They tried returning the items but since the neighbors didn't claim them, the author started throwing them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost got into a fight because his kid's glove was thrown away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. The neighbors' kids were entering without permission and leaving items. The author made their stance clear. But when they throw away the items, does that cross a line?\n\nLegally, if someone leaves something on your property, you might have a duty to hold onto it as lost property. However, since the neighbors were told not to leave items, maybe the author isn't obligated. But ethically, is there a responsibility to notify again before discarding? The author tried returning items before, but maybe the neighbors didn't take the message. However, throwing them away without notice might be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, there's the context of the ongoing conflict. The author is trying to protect their kids from the neighbor's kids, which adds to the tension. The act of throwing away the items could be seen as a way to enforce boundaries, but it might provoke the neighbors further. The fact that the neighbor dad was upset suggests that the action was offensive to them.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if you find property on your land, you might need to make a reasonable effort to return it before disposing. Since the author tried returning once, maybe that's sufficient. But if the items were left intentionally after being asked not to, then the author has a right to remove them. The key point is whether the author gave the neighbors a clear chance to retrieve the items before discarding.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as justified in maintaining their property and enforcing their rules, especially after repeated incidents. However, the confrontation with the neighbor might indicate that the method of disposal was too abrupt. Maybe a warning or another attempt to return would have been better, but given the history, the author might feel justified in their actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their property and had warned the neighbors. However, the legal aspect might vary, but ethically, they're upholding their boundaries. Therefore, answer B (No).\n"
