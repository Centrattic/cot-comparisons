Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying, and the author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep leaving stuff there, and the author goes from putting the items back to throwing them away.\n\nHmm. First, property rights are a big factor here. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. But the issue is ownership of the items. If the toys are left on the author's property, technically the author can handle them as they see fit since they're on their own property. However, the items belong to the neighbors, so disposing of them might be considered damaging someone else's property, which could be a problem legally.\n\nThe author did try to return the items at first. When that didn't work, they threw them away. The neighbor's dad got angry. So, even though the author has the right to their yard, they might be overstepping by destroying property that belongs to others. There's a difference between removing items and disposing of them. Returning items back to the neighbor's yard is one thing, but throwing them away could be seen as taking ownership or intentionally harming the neighbor's property, which might be illegal.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the kids are going through the yard to each other's houses. If the author's yard is being used as a pathway, maybe there's an implied permission or a different expectation about the items left behind. But the author had already communicated not wanting the kids in their yard. So they might feel justified in enforcing their rules strictly.\n\nBut legally, if the author is the rightful owner of the property, they can remove items, but they can't necessarily destroy them. They might need to return them or notify the owner. By throwing them away, they might be liable for the loss. So the author might be in the wrong here because they're disposing of someone else's property without proper notice or return.\n\nOn the other hand, if the neighbors are neglecting their kids and the items are considered abandoned, then the author could argue they're cleaning up. But abandonment is tricky. Just leaving something in a yard doesn't necessarily mean it's abandoned. The owner (the neighbor) might still claim it. So the author's actions could be seen as damaging property.\n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're disposing of others' property, which could be illegal. But some people might side with the author due to the conflict and the neighbor's kids not respecting the boundaries. However, legally, it's about handling others' property. So probably A.\n"
