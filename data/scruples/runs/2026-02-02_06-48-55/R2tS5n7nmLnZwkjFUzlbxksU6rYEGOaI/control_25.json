Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The neighbors aren't on good terms, there's been some bullying, and the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The author used to return the items but now just throws them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what's on it. But when they throw away items that belong to others, it could be seen as disposing of someone else's property. However, the neighbors have been told multiple times not to leave things there. The author might argue that since the items were left there without permission and the neighbors didn't claim them, it's reasonable to get rid of them. \n\nBut then there's the issue of ownership. Even if the items are left in the yard, they still belong to the neighbors. The author isn't stealing them; they're just taking possession. However, throwing them away could be seen as trespassing on the items' existence. The key point is whether the author had a duty to return the items or if their actions are reasonable given the prior warnings.\n\nAlso, the neighbor dad almost came to blows, indicating high tension. The author's actions might be seen as escalating the conflict. But considering the initial issues with the kids' behavior and the repeated requests to not enter the yard, the author might feel justified in protecting their space.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can't just throw away someone else's property, even if it's on your land. You might need to make reasonable efforts to return it. But the author tried returning them initially but stopped when the neighbors didn't claim them. However, the line between reasonable action and overstepping might be thin here.\n\nEthically, it's about balancing respect for property rights and the neighbor's rights. If the author has made their boundaries clear and the neighbors are ignoring them, the author might feel justified. But the act of disposal could still be seen as disrespectful or overreacting. The fact that the author's kids aren't in the neighbors' yard adds a point about fairness, but the situation is still about the author's property.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The author is in their rights to control their property but might be overstepping by disposing of the items. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if property rights are the main concern, but some might argue A if considering the neighbors' ownership and potential legal aspects.\n"
