Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbors' kids are using the author's yard for their games and leaving stuff there. The author has already told them multiple times not to do that. They used to leave the items but since the neighbors didn't pick them up, the author started throwing them back into their yard. Now, they just throw them away. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor dad when the glove was thrown away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone leaves property on your yard, you can't just throw it away because it's still their property. They have a right to it unless you get a court order or something. But maybe there's a legal way to have it considered abandoned after a certain period? Not sure. However, the question is more about moral or social blame rather than legal. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors aren't respecting that boundary. The kids keep coming through and leaving items. The author feels justified in removing the items because the neighbors aren't respecting their property. But throwing them away might be seen as harsh. Maybe the author could have tried other steps first, like informing the parents more carefully or sending the items back with a note, but since they don't speak, maybe that's hard. \n\nThe neighbor's perspective: They might feel the author is overreacting. The kids were just playing, and the items are still theirs. Even if the author told them not to leave things, maybe the kids aren't aware or the parents aren't supervising. The author's action of throwing the glove away directly caused conflict, leading to almost a physical fight. That's a bad outcome. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as necessary to enforce boundaries, especially after repeated issues. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without causing confrontation. However, the neighbor's kids are not following the author's rules, so the author might feel they have no choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author is on their own property and the items are on there without permission, they have the right to remove them. But throwing them away might be extreme. If the author could have stored them and tried to return them, that might be better, but the situation seems to be that they've tried returning them but the neighbors didn't claim them, leading to the current action. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is trying to protect their property and enforce their boundaries after multiple violations. While throwing away the items might be harsh, the neighbors aren't respecting the author's wishes, so the author is trying to put an end to it. I think the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're enforcing their boundaries, even if the method is a bit extreme. But I'm not 100% sure because it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
