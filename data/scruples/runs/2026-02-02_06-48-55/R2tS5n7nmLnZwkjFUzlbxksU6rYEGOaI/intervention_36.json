Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about throwing away neighbor kids' toys is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors have a bad relationship, with past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. However, the kids still go through the yard during games and leave items. The author initially left the items but now throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, legal perspective: Property owners generally have the right to remove items left on their property without permission. But there might be nuances. If the items are clearly the neighbors', the author might be expected to return them rather than discard. However, if the neighbors are repeatedly ignoring requests to not leave items, the author could argue self-preservation.\n\nMoral/ethical angle: The author tried to ignore and avoid conflict but now takes a firm stance. The neighbors aren't respecting boundaries, and the author feels justified in protecting their space. However, throwing away someone else's belongings, even if left on their property, can be seen as harsh. Maybe a middle ground like returning items but not letting them stay in the yard.\n\nBut the key points are: The author has set clear boundaries. The neighbors aren't respecting them. The author is taking action to enforce those boundaries. The items are left in their yard, so technically the author can handle them, but throwing away might be seen as overstepping. Maybe the correct action would be to return the items each time, but since the neighbors aren't retrieving them, the author feels justified in discarding to prevent accumulation.\n\nIn some places, abandoned property laws might allow disposal after a certain time, but it's unclear here if the items are considered abandoned. If they're still being used (like multiple baseballs), maybe not. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable to prevent clutter and enforce boundaries, especially after repeated issues. So, the answer leans towards not in the wrong (B). But there's a gray area. However, considering the neighbor's disregard for the author's requests, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
