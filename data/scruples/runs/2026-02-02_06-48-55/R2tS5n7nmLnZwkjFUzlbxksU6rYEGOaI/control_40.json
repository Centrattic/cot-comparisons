Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves neighbors they don't get along with, and there were some past issues with their kids bullying the author's kids. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. Despite being told, the kids still leave items there. The author used to throw them back but now throws them away. There was a confrontation with the neighbor dad when a glove was thrown away.\n\nFirst, property rights: if something is left on your property, you own it? Wait, no. If someone leaves an item on your property, it's technically still their property. So the author doesn't have the right to throw away someone else's belongings, even if they're on their own land. But there's a nuance here. The author tried to return the items, which is the correct approach. However, when they started throwing them away, that's where the issue might be. Throwing away instead of returning could be seen as destroying property, which is different from returning it.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard. But the kids keep coming through, leading to the items being left. The author is frustrated and has taken a firm stance. However, legally, even if someone trespasses, the items they leave behind are still their property. The owner of the property can't just discard them. They should either return them or contact the owner. Since the author tried returning but the items were left for a long time, maybe there's a point where the owner could be considered to have abandoned the items. But in most jurisdictions, abandonment requires intent to give up ownership. If the items were just left temporarily, that might not apply.\n\nThen there's the context of the bad relationship. The author's actions might be seen as a way to assert control, but they might have crossed a line by discarding the items instead of trying to return them. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) indicates that the author's action was perceived as a violation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they disposed of someone else's property without attempting to contact the owner first. Even though they had a prior issue with the neighbors, the correct course of action would be to return the items or contact the parents. Throwing them away could be considered a breach of property rights. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
