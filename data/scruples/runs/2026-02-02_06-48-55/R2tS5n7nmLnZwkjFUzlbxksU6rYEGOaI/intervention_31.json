Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a neighbor throwing away toys left in their yard by the other neighbors' kids. The neighbors don't get along because of some past issues like kids bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. But the kids keep coming through, playing, and leaving items. The author first tried returning the items, but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are property ownership and communication. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. They did communicate their boundaries, which is important. The other neighbors' kids are using the yard without permission and leaving items, which the author is trying to manage. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about how they handle the items. If the items are left on the author's property, technically they can dispose of them since it's their property. However, there's a social obligation to return lost property. The author tried returning them before, but when that didn't work, they switched to throwing them away. The neighbor's reaction was aggressive, leading to an almost fight.\n\nSo, considering property rights and the fact that the author communicated their stance, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author did warn the neighbors and tried to be accommodating by returning items initially. Once the neighbors didn't respect the boundaries, the author's actions might be justified. However, throwing away personal items without trying to return them might still be seen as harsh, even if they have the legal right to do so. The answer could depend on cultural norms and how the community perceives such actions. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the situation is complex, maybe the answer is A or B. But I need to decide based on the given info.\n"
