Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about whether throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The neighbors don't get along, there was bullying, and the writer has explicitly told the neighbors not to let their kids hang out or leave things in their yard. The kids still do it, and the writer starts throwing the items away. There was even a confrontation with the neighbor Dad.\n\nI should think about property rights. Generally, if someone leaves items on your property, you can ask them to remove them. If they don't, you might have the right to dispose of them, especially if they're considered abandoned. But maybe there's a proper legal process, like giving notice first? The writer did tell them not to leave things, so maybe that's sufficient notice.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions that their own kids don't go into the neighbors' yards. So there's a one-way thing here. The neighbors' kids are using the yard as a path, leading to items being left behind. The writer tried leaving the items but they were never claimed. Then they started throwing them back, but now they just dispose of them.\n\nThe key points here are: the property owner's rights, the prior communication, and the neighbors' actions. The writer made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors ignored this. The items were left in the yard, possibly abandoned. The writer is trying to enforce their boundaries after repeated requests.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land, you might need to give them a chance to retrieve it. The writer gave that chance by leaving the items, but since they were never claimed, maybe throwing them away is okay. However, throwing them back into the neighbor's yard might be different from throwing them away entirely. The neighbor's reaction could imply that they didn't expect the items to be discarded.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting boundaries. The writer has tried to be patient but the neighbors haven't respected their wishes. The writer's actions are a form of self-help, enforcing their property rights. But maybe there's a more formal way to handle it, like sending a notice via mail or involving local authorities if needed. However, the writer might not be obligated to go that far if they've already communicated their wishes clearly.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've established boundaries, the neighbors didn't respect them, and the items were left unclaimed. Disposing of them could be justified as self-help. But there might be a better way to handle it, but legally and ethically, the writer's actions seem reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
