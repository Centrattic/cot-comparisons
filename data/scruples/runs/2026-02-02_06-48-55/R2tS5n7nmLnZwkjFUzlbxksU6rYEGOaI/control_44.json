Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the main issue is that the neighbor's kids are leaving toys in the author's yard, and the author is throwing them away after multiple requests not to let the kids hang out there. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the neighbors don't get along with them, especially because of some bullying incidents and a past conflict with the dog. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. However, the kids still come through, leave items behind, and those items stay there for a long time. The author initially left the items but then started throwing them back into the neighbors' yard and now throws them away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for disposing of the toys. Let's consider the legal and moral angles here. Legally, the author owns the property, so anything left on their property could be considered abandoned. If items are left on someone's property without permission, the owner might have the right to dispose of them, especially if they've given prior notice. The author did mention they asked the neighbors multiple times, so there's a clear communication of boundaries.\n\nMoral-wise, the situation is a bit trickier. The author is frustrated with the ongoing issue and the children's behavior. The fact that the neighbor kids continue to come into the yard despite the author's warnings might justify the author's actions. However, some might argue that throwing away personal property could be seen as harsh, especially if the parents weren't aware the items were being discarded. The confrontation with the neighbor's dad suggests that this is a sensitive issue, and the author's directness might have caused tension.\n\nAnother point is that the author's children are not entering the neighbors' yard, so the author is trying to maintain a boundary. The items are left behind repeatedly, which could be seen as the neighbors not respecting the author's space. The author's actions might be seen as a reasonable response given the prior communication and the lack of respect from the neighbors.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that even if the items are abandoned, the author could have returned them instead of throwing them away. Returning the items might have been a more peaceful solution, but the author tried that first and the items still stayed for a long time. The neighbor dad's reaction when finding out about the glove being thrown away indicates that the parents might not have been aware the items were missing, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did try to address the issue through multiple requests. The neighbors' kids aren't respecting the boundaries, so the author's frustration is understandable. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportional to the situation. Since the author gave multiple warnings and the problem persisted, discarding the items might be justified as a form of self-enforcement of property rights.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author is trying to enforce their property boundaries after repeated issues and the items were left without permission. The author's actions, while perhaps harsh, are a response to ongoing disrespect of their property.\n"
