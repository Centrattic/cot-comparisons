Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbors' kids are using their yard to play games and leaving stuff there. The author has already told them not to do that, but they keep doing it. The author then started throwing away the items they left behind. \n\nFirst, I need to think about property rights. If something is left on someone's property, does the owner have the right to dispose of it? I think in many places, if someone leaves personal property on your land without permission, you can legally get rid of it after giving notice. The author did mention they had asked multiple times, so that's a point in their favor.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how they handle it. Throwing away items might be seen as harsh. The neighbor's dad got angry, almost leading to a fight. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like returning the items or giving a warning before discarding them. \n\nAlso, the context of the relationship between the families is important. They already have a strained relationship because of past issues like the dog incident and the kids bullying. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids are causing repeated problems, so the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Legally, if the items are on the author's property and they were notified not to leave them, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, socially, maybe there's a better way to handle it. The author could have tried contacting the parents first or giving the items to the local authorities. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's own kids don't go into the neighbors' yard while the neighbors' kids do might show a difference in respect for boundaries. The author is trying to enforce their rules, which they have a right to do. \n\nBut the act of throwing away items could be seen as extreme. Maybe the author should have given more time or tried to return them. However, since the items were left repeatedly, the author might feel justified in taking stronger action. \n\nSo considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they made their boundaries clear and took action after repeated violations. But it's a bit of a close call because handling it differently might have been better.\n"
