Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor's kids. The situation involves some background tension between the neighbors, including past issues with the kids bullying their kids and a conflict over a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids keep coming through, leaving items. The author tried leaving the items but that didn't work, then moved to throwing them back, and now throwing them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost got into a fight because the glove was thrown away.\n\nLegally, property owners have rights. If the items are left on someone's property, the owner can dispose of them, especially if they've notified the other party. The author did notify the neighbors multiple times, so that's a point in their favor. However, the neighbor's kids are using the yard to go between their houses, which might be a common area or a pathway. Depending on local laws, if the yard is considered part of a shared space or if the kids are just passing through, there might be different considerations. But the author's main issue is with items left behind.\n\nEthically, it's about respect and communication. The author is trying to protect their space and has made their stance clear. Throwing away items could be seen as harsh, but given the prior issues (bullying, the dog incident), the author might feel justified. The fact that they tried to return items before escalating to throwing them away shows some consideration. However, the neighbors might see this as unnecessary conflict, especially if there's a history of not getting along.\n\nAnother angle: Are the items considered abandoned? If they're left there for a long time, maybe the author has a right to dispose of them. But if the items are still in use by the kids, throwing them away could be seen as taking away their belongings without notice. However, the author had already tried returning them, so maybe they're considered abandoned by that point.\n\nThe fact that the author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard adds to the asymmetry. The neighbors' kids are using the yard without permission, leading to more tension. The author's actions are a response to repeated offenses after clear communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the neighbors' kids are the ones causing the issue by entering the yard. The author's actions are a response to protect their property. Legally, the author might be justified, but ethically, some might argue that there's a better way to handle it, like contacting the parents first or giving more notice before disposal. However, the author did mention trying to communicate and escalating only after the problem persisted.\n\nThe almost-physical-confrontation with the neighbor dad complicates things. It shows that the neighbors are sensitive about it, but the author's stance is firm. The key here is whether the author's actions exceed reasonable measures. Since they've communicated their rules and the items are left on their property, throwing them away could be seen as reasonable, especially after prior attempts to return them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've made their boundaries clear, tried to resolve the issue amicably, and the items are on their property. The neighbors' kids are the ones entering without permission. So the answer is B (No).\n"
