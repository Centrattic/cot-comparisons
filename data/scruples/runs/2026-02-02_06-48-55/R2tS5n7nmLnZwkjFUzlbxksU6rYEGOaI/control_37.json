Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for throwing away toys left by their neighbors' kids. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is ownership and property rights. The author clearly states that their neighbor's kids are leaving items in their yard. The author has set boundaries, telling the neighbors not to have their kids hang out in their yard. Despite being told, the kids still come through and leave stuff. \n\nThe author used to leave the items but noticed they weren't claimed. Now, they're throwing them away. The neighbor got angry when a glove was thrown away. So, does the author have the right to dispose of items left on their property?\n\nProperty laws generally state that if someone leaves items on your property, you can't just throw them away because you might be liable for trespassing on their property. Even if the items are left behind, the owner still has rights to them. The author might be infringing on the neighbor's ownership by discarding the toys. \n\nBut there's context here: the neighbors have a strained relationship, and the author has been asked not to have their kids in the yard. However, the author is still on their own property. The problem is that the neighbor's kids are using the yard to get between their houses. If the author doesn't want them there, maybe they should block access or communicate again. But throwing away items might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. \n\nThe author did ask the neighbors multiple times, but if the items are left on their property, the legal stance might still side with the neighbor as the owner of the items. The author's action could be considered overstepping because they're disposing of someone else's property, even if it's on their land. \n\nSo, while the author has a valid concern about their property and safety, especially with the autistic son, the act of throwing away the toys could be seen as wrong because it's not their property to discard. They might need to inform the neighbors first, maybe put up signs, or involve authorities to handle the items properly instead of just throwing them away.\n"
