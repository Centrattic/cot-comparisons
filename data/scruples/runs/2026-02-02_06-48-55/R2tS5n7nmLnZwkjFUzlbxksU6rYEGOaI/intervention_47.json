Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. The situation involves ongoing tension with neighbors, past issues with bullying, and the author making it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. The author used to return the items but now throws them away, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control who enters and what's on their property. If the neighbors' kids are entering without permission, that's a problem. The author made their stance clear, so the kids might be trespassing.\n\nNext, the issue of the toys. If the toys are left in the yard without permission, the author could argue they have no obligation to keep them. However, throwing them away might be seen as discarding someone else's property. But if the author doesn't want the kids in their yard, they might feel justified in removing the items and not being responsible for them.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author tried to return the items initially, which shows some effort to resolve the issue. When that didn't work, they escalated to throwing them away. The neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) indicates this is a sensitive issue. \n\nLegally, the author might not be in the wrong since they're on their property. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author has the right to their space but might be overstepping by discarding items, even if the items were left without permission. However, given the context of prior conflicts and the author's attempts to set boundaries, it's understandable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The key points are property rights, prior communication, and the nature of the items. If the author clearly stated the rules and the neighbors ignored them, then the author's actions might be justifiable. However, the act of throwing away property, even if left in a trespassing manner, could be seen as harsh. But considering the ongoing issues and the author's efforts to maintain boundaries, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
