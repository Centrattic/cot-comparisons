Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor throwing away toys that the neighbor's kids left in their yard. There's some backstory about the neighbors not getting along, kids bullying, and a previous incident with a dog. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard, but despite that, the kids still come through and leave items. The author used to return the items to the neighbors' yard but now just throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away the items. The user thinks they are in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, property rights. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. If items are left there, they can legally dispose of them. However, there's a social aspect. The author has already communicated their boundaries multiple times. The neighbor kids are not supposed to be in the yard, yet they still come in and leave things. The author tried returning the items but the neighbors didn't claim them. Now, throwing them away is a response to the continued disregard for their boundaries.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of just throwing them away, maybe contacting the parents each time? However, the neighbors are hostile, so that might not be feasible. The author is trying to enforce their own space. On the other hand, the items might still belong to the kids, and the author is taking ownership by discarding them, which could be seen as going too far. However, the parents might be responsible for their kids' belongings. The confrontation with the neighbor Dad suggests that this is a sensitive issue. \n\nIn many places, if someone leaves property on your land, you can dispose of it if you've tried to return it and the owner doesn't claim it. But the author is not giving the items a chance to be claimed now; they just throw them away immediately. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if the items are valuable or the parents might want them. But the author has already done this multiple times without issue before the confrontation. The key here is whether there's a legal right to dispose of items left on one's property after a reasonable attempt to return them. Since the author tried returning them before, but the neighbors didn't pick them up, maybe the author is justified. However, once the items are on their property, the author has the right to handle them as they see fit. The problem is the relationship aspect. The neighbors are already unhappy, and this adds to the tension. \n\nSo, legally, the author might not be in the wrong, but socially, it's a gray area. The question is whether AITA is about legal right or social norms. Since AITA is a social context, the answer might lean on whether the action is seen as inconsiderate or aggressive. But the author has clearly stated boundaries and the neighbors are violating them. The author is trying to enforce those boundaries, which is reasonable. However, throwing away items could be seen as taking it too far if the parents expected to retrieve them. \n\nThe answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is enforcing their property rights. However, some might argue that they should have given more notice. But the author has already communicated the boundaries and tried returning the items. The neighbors' kids keep violating the rules, so the author's response is a logical step to stop the problem.\n"
