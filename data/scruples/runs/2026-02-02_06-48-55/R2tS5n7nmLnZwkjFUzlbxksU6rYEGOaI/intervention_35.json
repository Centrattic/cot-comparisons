Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away. The neighbors don't get along with them, and there was some bullying and a previous incident with a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their private property, so they have the right to control what's on it. The neighbors' kids are entering the yard without permission and leaving items behind. The author initially tried to return the items but later started throwing them away. \n\nThe author did communicate their boundaries, telling the neighbors not to let their kids come into their yard. But the neighbors' kids keep entering and leaving stuff. The author's actions might be seen as a response to the ongoing issue. However, throwing away the items could be seen as excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to remove items from their property, especially if they've informed the neighbors. The problem is that the items might belong to the neighbors, so the author might have a responsibility to return them. If the author has already asked the neighbors to not leave items but they continue, maybe the author is within their rights to dispose of them to prevent further clutter. \n\nBut there's a question of ownership. The author isn't the owner of the toys, so throwing them away could be seen as damaging someone else's property. Even if the items were left unattended, the author might need to make a reasonable effort to return them, like placing them on the neighbor's property or contacting the owners. \n\nThe neighbor's reaction (almost coming to blows) suggests that the author's actions are causing conflict. The author's initial approach of returning the items was better, and escalating to disposal might be too harsh. However, if the neighbors aren't respecting the author's boundaries, the author might feel they have no choice but to take stronger action. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, property owners can remove items left on their property, but there might be a duty to safeguard lost property. However, since the items are being left by children who are entering without permission, the author's responsibility might be less. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They have a right to their property, but disposing of someone else's items can be seen as taking ownership. The fact that they communicated the rules and the neighbors didn't comply might justify their actions. But ethically, maybe they could have tried to return the items in a more constructive way. \n\nConsidering the situation, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they have a right to control their property and have communicated this. However, the other side argues that they should return the items. The conflict arises from the neighbors not respecting the boundaries, so the author's actions are a response to that. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
