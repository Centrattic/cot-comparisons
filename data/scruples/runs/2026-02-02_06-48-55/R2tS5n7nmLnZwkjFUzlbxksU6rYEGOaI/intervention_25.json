Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids. The key points here are ownership, communication, and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've made it clear to the neighbors that they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. The neighbors' kids are using the yard for games and leaving items. The author initially left the items, but after the items stayed there for a long time, they started throwing them back and now just throw them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost came to blows because the author threw away a glove they left in the yard.\n\nOwnership: The author owns their property, so they have the right to control what happens there. However, the neighbor's kids are using the yard, implying that maybe there's an unspoken understanding. But the author has communicated their boundaries, so the neighbors should respect that.\n\nCommunication: The author has clearly stated their boundaries. The neighbors' kids are still using the yard and leaving items, which could be seen as a violation of those boundaries. However, the author's response is to throw away the items, which might be seen as extreme. Maybe a better approach would be to contact the parents first to address the issue before discarding items.\n\nActions: Throwing away someone else's property, even if it's on your land, is a serious action. The author could have tried other methods like returning the items, contacting the parents, or posting signs. Throwing away items might be seen as not giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve them, especially if the items were left accidentally.\n\nThe neighbor dad's reaction suggests that the parents might not have been aware of the items being left or the author's actions. The author's justification is that they've asked multiple times, but if the neighbors are not communicating effectively, maybe there's a need for a different approach. However, the author's property rights are on their side. Still, discarding items without prior notice could lead to conflict and might not be the most responsible action.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to their property, the method of dealing with the items might be too harsh. The author could be in the wrong because they didn't give the neighbors a chance to claim the items before discarding them, even if the neighbors were at fault for leaving items. The appropriate step would be to notify the neighbors before getting rid of the items. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
