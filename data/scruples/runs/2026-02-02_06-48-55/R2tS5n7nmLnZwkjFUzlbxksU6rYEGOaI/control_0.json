Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The context is that there's existing tension between the neighbors, including past issues like bullying and a disagreement over a dog. The author has clearly communicated their boundaries about not wanting the kids in their yard and leaving items there. Despite this, the neighbors' kids keep coming through and leaving stuff. The author initially tried returning the items but now throws them away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most jurisdictions, property owners have the right to control their property. If items are left on someone's property, the owner isn't necessarily obligated to keep them. However, there might be a duty to make a reasonable effort to return lost property. But if the items are abandoned, the owner might have the right to dispose of them. However, the neighbor might argue that the items weren't abandoned but just temporarily misplaced.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author made their boundaries clear, which is their right. The neighbors' kids are repeatedly violating those boundaries. Throwing away items that are left in the yard could be seen as a defensive measure to enforce their space. However, directly confronting the neighbor and causing a conflict might escalate tensions. The author's actions could be seen as justified if they've tried to communicate and the neighbors aren't respecting their wishes.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of community relations. Even if the author is within their rights, the way they handle it might affect neighborhood dynamics. The question is whether the author's actions are proportionate. Throwing away items without trying to return them first might be seen as harsh, especially if the items have sentimental value. However, the author mentions previous attempts to return them, but the items were left for a long time. So maybe their escalation is understandable.\n\nAnother angle is the initial conflict over the dog. The author had a valid concern about their autistic son being scared, so their stance on keeping the yard to themselves is stronger. The neighbors not getting along adds to the complexity. The author's actions might be seen as self-protective given the prior issues.\n\nIn summary, the author has a right to their property and tried to set boundaries. Disposing of items left on their property, especially when the neighbors aren't respecting those boundaries, might be justified. However, the confrontation with the neighbor could have been handled more diplomatically. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering the prior context, the answer might lean towards B (No).\n"
