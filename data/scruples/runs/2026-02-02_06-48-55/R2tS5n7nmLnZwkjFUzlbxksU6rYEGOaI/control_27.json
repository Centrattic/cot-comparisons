Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is wrong for throwing away toys from their yard that were left by neighbor kids. The context is that the neighbors don't get along, there were past issues with bullying and a dog incident, and the AITA had made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard. Despite being told, the neighbors' kids kept leaving items, leading the AITA to start discarding them.\n\nFirst, property rights come into play here. The AITA owns the yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. They had communicated their boundaries, and the neighbors didn't respect them. The AITA tried to return items but when that didn't work, they stopped. Throwing away items that are left on your property isn't inherently illegal, but it might be seen as harsh depending on the circumstances.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect. Even if legally they can do it, socially it might be frowned upon because it escalates tensions. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, so this action has consequences. The AITA might be seen as taking it too far, not giving the neighbors a chance to retrieve items, or being uncooperative.\n\nBut considering the prior issues\u2014bullying, the dog incident, and the neighbors not respecting boundaries\u2014it's understandable that the AITA wants to enforce their rules. They tried to be polite initially by returning items, but when that failed, they had to take more direct action. The key point is that the AITA made their stance clear and the neighbors didn't comply. In such a hostile environment, the AITA's actions could be seen as self-protective.\n\nSo, while the AITA might have a valid reason based on the neighbors' behavior, the act of throwing away items without a clear warning or alternative might still be considered harsh. But given the context, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether you prioritize property rights and boundaries over social harmony. Since the AITA had already communicated their wishes and the neighbors didn't adhere, it's more about the neighbors' failure to respect boundaries than the AITA being wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
