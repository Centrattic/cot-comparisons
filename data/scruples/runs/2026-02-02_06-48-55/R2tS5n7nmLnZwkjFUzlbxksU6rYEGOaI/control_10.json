Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along with the author. There were issues with the neighbor kids bullying their kids and a dog incident. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The neighbors' kids still come through, leave items, and the author used to leave the items but now throws them away. There was a conflict when the neighbor dad found out.\n\nSo, the question is about ownership and property rights. The items are left in the author's yard. Legally, if someone leaves something on your property, does the owner of the property have the right to dispose of it? I think in many jurisdictions, once property is left on your land without permission, you can dispose of it, especially if the owner hasn't claimed it. The author did mention they asked the neighbors not to leave things, so it's not like they didn't try to communicate.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Even if legally the author is right, the neighbors might feel it's rude. The author's actions led to a near-confrontation. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like leaving the items at the neighbor's door or contacting them before disposal. However, the neighbor kids were already in the yard despite being asked not to be, so the author is trying to enforce boundaries.\n\nThe author's kids don't enter the neighbors' yard, so it's a consistent boundary. The author is protecting their own property from unwanted items and interactions. While the neighbors are upset, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for removing items from their own yard. The key points are communication (they did ask), ownership of the yard, and the items being abandoned.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're enforcing their property rights and have communicated their boundaries. However, maybe there's a nuance if local laws require giving notice before disposing of items. But generally, it's the property owner's right.\n"
