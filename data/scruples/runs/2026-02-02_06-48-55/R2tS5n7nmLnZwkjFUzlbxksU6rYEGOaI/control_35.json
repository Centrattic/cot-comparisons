Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away after being asked multiple times to not let the kids use their yard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what happens there. They've already told the neighbors not to let their kids use the yard, so if the kids are still coming in, the neighbors might be at fault for not controlling their children.\n\nBut when items are left on the property, there's a question of ownership. Just because the items are on the author's property doesn't mean the author can just throw them away. The items belong to the neighbors, so discarding them without returning them could be considered theft or at least damaging someone else's property. Even if the neighbors are being difficult, the author has a responsibility to handle the neighbors' belongings properly.\n\nThe author tried to return the items by putting them back into the neighbors' yard, which is a reasonable approach. However, when they started throwing them away, that might cross a line. If the items were clearly left behind and not claimed, maybe there's a point where they become abandoned, but usually, there's a process to notify the owner first. The author has tried to communicate, but if the neighbors are not responsive, the author might feel justified. However, throwing away someone else's property is generally not acceptable, regardless of the tension.\n\nAlso, there was an incident where the neighbor's dog scared the author's autistic son, leading to a conflict. This context might explain the author's frustration, but it doesn't negate the fact that discarding property is a legal issue. The author could have taken other steps, like contacting the police or a mediator, but destroying or discarding property without notice is typically not advised.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone leaves items on your property, you might need to make a reasonable effort to return them before disposing of them. Since the author tried to return them but the neighbors didn't claim them, there's ambiguity. However, the act of throwing them away could still be seen as trespassing on legal rights. The author's actions might be considered in the wrong because they're handling the neighbors' property without permission, even if the neighbors are at fault for allowing the kids to use the yard.\n\nSo, considering the legal perspective and the usual expectations of property handling, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
