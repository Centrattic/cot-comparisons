Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbor kids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The neighbors don't get along with them, there were past issues with the kids bullying their own kids, and there was a specific incident with the dog. The author has made it clear they don't want the neighbor kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming in and leaving items. The author used to leave the items but eventually started throwing them away. There was a confrontation when the neighbor found out.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership of the property and the items. The author's yard is their private property. If someone leaves items on your property, technically, you might have the right to do with them as you see fit, especially if they're not claimed. But there's also the aspect of negligence. If the items are left by mistake, maybe the author could have tried to return them. However, the author says they tried throwing them back into the neighbor's yard but that's not working. Now they just throw them away.\n\nBut the problem is that the items belong to the neighbors. Even if they were left in the yard, the author might not have the right to dispose of them, especially without trying to contact the owner first. However, the author did make it clear they don't want the kids in their yard, and the neighbors are not following that. So maybe the author is within their rights to remove the items, but the method of disposal could be an issue. Throwing them away without trying to return them might be seen as harsh, but given the ongoing issues and the lack of cooperation from the neighbors, it's understandable.\n\nAlso, in some places, there are laws about found property. If someone leaves an item on your property, you might have to make a reasonable effort to return it. If you can't, then it becomes abandoned. But the author has tried leaving them and then returning them, but the neighbors aren't claiming them. So maybe the author is justified in disposing of unclaimed items.\n\nBut the fact that the neighbor's dad almost came to blows over it complicates things. Maybe the author could have given more notice before throwing them away. However, the author has already made their stance clear, and the neighbors aren't respecting that. So the author's actions might be seen as self-preservation, especially after repeated issues.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they are protecting their property and have made their wishes known. The neighbors are not following the boundaries, so the author is within their rights to remove the items, especially if they are unclaimed. The main issue is the neighbor's lack of respect for the author's property and the prior warnings. The author is not obligated to keep someone else's abandoned property indefinitely, especially if it's causing conflict. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
