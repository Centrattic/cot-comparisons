Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throws them away after previous attempts to return them were ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Property rights are important here. The author owns their yard, so they have the right to control what's on their property. However, just because the toys are on their property doesn't mean they can dispose of them. The toys belong to the neighbors, so the author might be trespassing on their rights by throwing them away without permission.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The neighbors have a history of conflict, including bullying and a disagreement about a dog. The author made it clear they didn't want the kids in their yard, but the kids still come through. The author tried returning the items initially, but when that didn't work, they started discarding them. The neighbor dad almost got into a fight because of this, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points are: the author's property rights versus the neighbors' ownership of the items. Legally, the author might be able to remove the items, but throwing them away could be seen as going beyond necessary. Maybe they should have stored them and waited longer or posted notices. The author's actions might be seen as confrontational, especially given the existing tensions. Even if they're on their own property, the way they handled it could be considered inconsiderate or aggressive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't let their kids use the neighbors' yard, which is consistent. But the neighbors' kids are using the author's yard despite being told not to. The author's response is to throw away the items, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. The neighbors might feel disrespected or that the author isn't giving them a chance to retrieve the items properly.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't legally wrong, but socially, they might be. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. The answer might depend on the community norms and how the neighbors perceive it. Since the neighbor almost came to blows, it shows the action had a significant impact. The author could have found a less confrontational way, like holding onto the items longer or communicating again. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong because their action escalated the conflict unnecessarily despite previous attempts to resolve the issue.\n"
