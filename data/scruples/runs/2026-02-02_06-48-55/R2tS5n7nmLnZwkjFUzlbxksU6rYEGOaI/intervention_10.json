Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by their neighbors' kids. The situation is that the neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying, and the author has made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite this, the kids keep leaving items behind.\n\nThe author first tried leaving the items, but they stayed there forever. Then they tried putting them back into the neighbors' yard. Now, they just throw them away. There was an incident where the neighbor dad almost got into a fight because his kid's glove was thrown away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's property is their own. They have the right to control what's on their property. The neighbors' kids are entering the yard without permission, which is a problem. But the author has already tried to communicate their boundaries. The issue is the discarded toys. If someone leaves property on your land, do you have the right to dispose of it? \n\nIn many places, if someone leaves property on your land, you have a duty to hold onto it as a bailee, perhaps, and notify the owner. However, if the items are left there repeatedly and the owner is aware, maybe that changes things. The author has tried returning the items to the neighbors' yard, but now throws them away. The problem is that even if the kids are trespassing, the items might still belong to the neighbors, so the author might not have the right to destroy them. \n\nBut the author tried to give them back. The neighbor kids are walking through the yard, which is trespassing. The author's kids don't go into the neighbors' yard. So the author is trying to be consistent. However, the neighbor dad is upset because of the glove. \n\nLegally, if the items are left on your property, you can't just throw them away without trying to return them. The author tried returning them to the neighbors' yard. But maybe they should have kept the items and notified the owners instead. If they can't do that, maybe they can't dispose of them. So, the author might be in the wrong because they destroyed someone else's property without trying to return it. \n\nBut the context of the neighbors not getting along and the author being clear about their boundaries complicates things. The author might feel justified, but legally and ethically, they might have a responsibility to handle the items differently. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they threw away the items instead of trying to return them to the owners or keeping them until claimed. Even if they tried to return by putting them back, maybe that wasn't sufficient. Alternatively, if the neighbors' kids are trespassing, maybe the author can claim the items are abandoned. But it's not clear. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they destroyed property that isn't theirs, regardless of the circumstances. They should have tried to return the items to the owners (the parents) first. Throwing them away without contacting the parents is probably not acceptable.\n"
