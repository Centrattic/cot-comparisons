Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is dealing with neighbors whose kids are leaving toys in their yard. The neighbors aren't on good terms with them, and there's been some past issues like bullying and a dog incident. The author made it clear they don't want the neighbors' kids in their yard. The kids keep going through, leaving toys, and the author started throwing the toys away after previously trying to return them.\n\nThe main question is about ownership and responsibility. The author's property is being trespassed upon by the kids, leading to items being left behind. The key points here are: the author has communicated their boundaries, the kids are ignoring these boundaries, and the author is disposing of the items to prevent further issues.\n\nLegally, if someone leaves property on your land, you might not have the right to destroy it, but practical considerations include repeated trespassing and the items being considered abandoned. There's a balance between protecting one's property and respecting ownership of others' items. The author's actions could be seen as a strong measure to deter future trespassing, but discarding items might be seen as harsh, especially if the items are still valuable to others.\n\nConsidering community norms, people often handle this differently. Some might return the items, others might leave them out, and some might dispose of them if the issue persists. The author's approach is a response to ongoing problems with the neighbors, so their intent is to stop the kids from coming into their yard. However, throwing away items is a final act and could escalate tensions, especially since the neighbor almost came to blows over it.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for a balance between being reasonable and standing up for oneself. If the author had tried other methods first, like returning the items multiple times, they might be seen as more reasonable. But since they've already tried returning the items and the neighbors ignored their wishes, their frustration is understandable. However, discarding the items without a formal notice or communication might be seen as crossing a line, especially if the items aren't truly abandoned but just forgotten.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author gave the neighbors enough notice and if there were other steps they could have taken. Since the author did communicate their boundaries and tried returning the items, but the neighbors continued, the author's actions might be seen as justified. But if the items were still the neighbors' property, even if left behind, the author might not have the right to dispose of them. This creates a conflict between property rights and the neighbors' ongoing trespassing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for being frustrated, the act of throwing away the items might be seen as the wrong move because it could be considered damaging others' property. However, if the items were left on the author's property without permission, and the neighbors are repeatedly violating the boundaries, it's a gray area. The community might see it as a justified reaction, but others might think the author should handle it differently.\n"
