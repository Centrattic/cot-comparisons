Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kids leaving toys in their yard, and the author throwing them away after previous attempts to handle it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are property rights and prior communication. The author made it clear that they don't want the neighbor's kids in their yard or leaving items there. The neighbors' kids are using the yard as a passageway, which leads to items being left behind. The author initially tried returning the items but now just throws them away. There's tension, including an almost physical altercation when a baseball glove was discarded.\n\nLegally, the author owns their property, so they have the right to remove items left there without permission. However, there's a social aspect to consider. The neighbors might feel that the items belong to their children and have a right to retrieve them. The author did communicate their preference, but the neighbors' kids are still coming onto the property, which complicates things. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as reasonable because they've set boundaries and the neighbors aren't respecting them. On the other hand, throwing away the items might be seen as harsh, especially if the items were lost rather than intentionally left. The fact that the author previously tried returning the items but now just discards them might indicate frustration, which could affect public opinion.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider both legal rights and social etiquette. Since the author made their stance clear and the neighbors aren't adhering to the agreed-upon boundaries, the author's actions in discarding the items might be justified. The fact that the neighbors' kids are repeatedly entering the yard despite being asked to stay out adds to the justification. However, the escalation to almost a fight might shift some blame, but the core issue is about respecting property boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are likely within their rights, and given the context of prior communication and the neighbors' continued disregard, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
