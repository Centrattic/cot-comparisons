Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, the context: The neighbors don't get along with the author, there's been some bullying issues, and the author has explicitly told them not to let their kids hang out in the yard or leave items there. Despite this, the kids keep coming through, playing games, and leaving stuff. The author used to put the items back but now just throws them away.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The author's yard is their property, so they have the right to control what stays on it. If the items are left in their yard without permission, they aren't the author's property. So, the author isn't legally wrong for disposing of them. However, there's a social aspect. Even if it's the neighbor's fault for not retrieving the items, throwing them away without return might be seen as harsh, especially if the items are valuable or if the neighbor is trying to be reasonable.\n\nThe author has made their boundaries clear. The neighbors' kids are not following those boundaries, which is a problem. The author's previous approach was to return the items, but that didn't work. Now they're discarding them. While legally the author has a right to do that, socially, it might be considered rude or inconsiderate. The neighbor dad almost came to blows, indicating that this is a sensitive issue. \n\nThe key points are: Right of property owner vs. the neighbor's perspective. Even if the author isn't in the wrong legally, the social implications might make them seem inconsiderate. However, given the history of conflict and the author making their stance clear, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms or community expectations. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider both legal rights and social norms. Since the author has communicated their wishes and the neighbors aren't respecting them, the author's actions could be seen as justified. But if the items are just forgotten, maybe the author should have tried another method first. However, since they tried returning and it didn't help, throwing away might be acceptable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they own the property. However, some might argue A (in the wrong) because of the social aspect. But given the context of not getting along and prior attempts to resolve, B seems more accurate.\n"
