Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by neighbors' kids. \n\nFirst, the neighbors have a history of issues: kids bullying their own, a dog incident, and general lack of communication. The author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard and emphasized not to leave things there. The neighbors' kids still leave items, and the author started throwing them away after previous attempts to return them failed.\n\nThe key points are ownership and communication. The neighbor kids are technically trespassing if they're entering the yard without permission. However, the items left behind could be considered lost property, which in some jurisdictions might require certain steps before disposal. The author did try to return them by placing them back in the yard, but when that didn't work, they started discarding them.\n\nLegally, property owners can sometimes remove items left on their land, but there might be a duty to notify or wait a certain period. The author did warn them, so maybe that's covered. The neighbor Dad's reaction to the glove being thrown away could be seen as escalating the conflict. The author's actions are a form of self-help, but if the items are the neighbors', discarding them without notice might be seen as damaging their property. However, the author made their stance clear.\n\nEmotionally, the author has valid reasons due to past issues. The neighbors aren't respecting boundaries, which adds context. But legally or morally, throwing away items might be seen as wrong if the owner is still identifiable and reachable. The author could have tried another method, like contacting the parents directly or giving a notice period before disposal.\n\nSo, while the author has a legitimate grievance, the act of discarding items might cross a line. It's a judgment call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because even with the prior issues, they could have handled it differently to avoid damaging belongings.\n"
