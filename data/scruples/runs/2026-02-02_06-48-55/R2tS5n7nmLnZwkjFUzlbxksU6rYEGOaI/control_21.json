Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor's kids. The situation is that the neighbors don't get along, there was some bullying, and the author made it clear they don't want the kids in their yard. Despite that, the kids keep coming through and leaving stuff. The author used to put the items back, but now just throws them away. The neighbor got angry when a glove was thrown away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. The author's yard is their private property. If someone else's kids leave items there, the author isn't obligated to keep them. However, there's a social aspect. Even if it's their property, how they handle the items could affect neighborly relations. The author did warn the neighbors, and the kids ignore the request. So the author's actions are in response to prior issues. \n\nBut the problem is, when they throw away the items, it's causing conflict. The neighbor dad almost came to blows. The author's justification is that they've been asked multiple times to stay out and not leave things. Legally, the author can remove items from their property, but ethically, maybe they could have tried other methods first, like contacting the parents or using a lost and found. However, the author says the neighbors don't communicate with them. So maybe they feel there's no other option. \n\nAlso, the kids are leaving items repeatedly, and the author is frustrated. The author's son was scared by a dog, which adds to the tension. The author's actions are a reaction to ongoing issues. Legally, they can dispose of items left on their property, especially if the owners are known and the items are left without permission. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author's approach might be seen as harsh, but given the strained relationship, they might feel it's necessary. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they have the right to their property, then technically no. But maybe they could have handled it differently to avoid conflict. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because they're acting within their rights. But some might argue that throwing away items is inconsiderate, even if it's legal. However, the context of prior conflicts and the neighbor's actions might mitigate that. So probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
