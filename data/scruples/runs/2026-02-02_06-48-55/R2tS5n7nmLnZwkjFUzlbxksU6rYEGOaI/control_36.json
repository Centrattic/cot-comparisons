Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for throwing away toys left in their yard by the neighbor kids.\n\nFirst, the background: The neighbors don't get along, there's been some bullying issues, and the neighbor's dog scared the autistic son. The writer has communicated clearly that they don't want the kids in their yard or leaving things there. Despite this, the kids keep using the yard for games and leaving items behind. The writer used to leave the items but then started throwing them back, and now just throws them away. There was even an altercation when the neighbor Dad confronted the writer about a glove being thrown away.\n\nSo, the main question is about ownership and property rights. The writer owns their yard, so anything left there by others is technically their property. The writer is removing items that don't belong to them, which is a common practice. However, there's a nuance here. The writer tried to return the items but now throws them away. The neighbor's kids are using the yard as a passageway, which the writer might be trying to deter by removing the items. \n\nBut the problem is that the items belong to the neighbors. Throwing them away might be seen as destroying someone else's property. However, the writer did communicate their stance before, maybe even multiple times. The neighbors' kids are not heeding the warnings, so the writer is trying to enforce their wishes. \n\nIn some cases, if someone leaves items on your property, you can store them, but not necessarily throw them away. However, the writer might argue that the items are being used as an excuse for the kids to keep coming into the yard. The altercation with the neighbor Dad complicates things, showing that the issue is causing tension. \n\nLegally, the writer might not be in the right because they're disposing of others' property without giving them a chance to retrieve it, even if they've been asked multiple times. But morally, considering the prior communication and the ongoing issues, it's a gray area. The writer is trying to protect their space and their children, but the method might be seen as harsh.\n\nSo, the answer could swing either way. If the writer had tried returning the items or gave a formal notice to retrieve them, it might be different. But since they now just throw them away, especially after the neighbor's confrontation, it might be seen as them going too far. Hence, maybe the writer is in the wrong (A). But others might argue that the neighbors' kids are trespassing, so the writer has the right to remove items (B). Hmm.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong because while they have the right to control their property, they are disposing of others' belongings, which is legally and ethically problematic. Even if the neighbor children have previously trespassed or ignored requests, the proper course of action would be to return the items or provide a formal notice for retrieval, not to destroy them. Throwing away personal property without giving the owner a reasonable opportunity to claim it constitutes damage to their belongings, which is a violation of their rights. The situation also escalates tensions unnecessarily, especially after a prior altercation, making the author's actions unjustified.",
