She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author correcting their girlfriend about her view of sex as a bargaining tool and a get-out-of-jail-free card. The author admits they let it go on too long because they enjoyed the sex but finally pushed back when she tried to use it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend uses sex to manipulate him into doing things he doesn't want to do. The author agrees to spend his day off helping her mom in exchange for sex, but he's exhausted and decides to back out. He confronts her, explaining that sex isn't everything and that he's better off resting. The argument gets heated, and he says she thinks too highly of herself, which might have crossed a line.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is. Let's analyze both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative and unhealthy. The author is finally setting a boundary, which is a positive step. However, his response during the argument might have been harsh. He accused her of overestimating her worth, which could be hurtful. But he also admitted that he's been complicit in letting it go on, which shows self-awareness.\n\nIn relationships, setting boundaries is important. The author had the right to say no, especially when he's exhausted. The girlfriend's reaction to being turned down might indicate issues with how she perceives their dynamic. However, the way the author communicated his needs could be improved. Instead of making her feel undervalued, a more constructive approach might have been better. Still, the core issue is her manipulation, and the author is addressing that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He made a mistake in how he phrased his rebuttal, but the main issue was the girlfriend's behavior. The author is taking a stand for his needs, which is necessary. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
