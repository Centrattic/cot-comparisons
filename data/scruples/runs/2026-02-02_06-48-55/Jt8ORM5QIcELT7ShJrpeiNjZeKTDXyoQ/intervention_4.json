She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's girlfriend thought sex was the most important thing and used it to persuade him to do things he didn't want to do. The author initially went along with it because the sex was great, but now he's pushing back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip, which is a form of manipulation. That's not healthy. The author is finally setting a boundary by refusing to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex, which he's entitled to do. However, he went a bit too far by saying she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself. That might have been harsh.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting the record. He's standing up for himself after letting things slide for too long. The problem was her using sex as a tool for control, not his refusal. His comment about her self-esteem might have been a mistake, but the core issue is her manipulation. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
