She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip to get the author to do things he doesn't want to do, like working at her mom's house. The author finally says no, leading to an argument where he tells her she thinks too highly of herself.\n\nFirst, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because he corrected her by asserting that sex isn't everything, which might come off as dismissive. But wait, he did acknowledge that sex is great with her, so maybe he's not entirely wrong. He's standing up for his boundaries, which is important. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her out on using sex as a bargaining chip, which is valid, but the comment about her \"thinking too highly of herself\" could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior of using sex to manipulate is problematic. The author had a right to set a boundary after being taken advantage of. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. He admitted he was wrong for letting it go on too long. Now, when he finally says no, the reaction might be justified as self-preservation. But the way he phrased his correction could have been more considerate. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He's right to set boundaries but maybe wrong in the delivery. However, since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), I need to decide. The author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary, but his comment about her self-image might be the over-the-line part. However, the user's main point is about correcting her manipulative behavior. The manipulator here is the girlfriend, so the author isn't wrong for pushing back. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
