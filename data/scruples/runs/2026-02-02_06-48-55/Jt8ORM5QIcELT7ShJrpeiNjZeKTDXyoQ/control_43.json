She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex and setting boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions his girlfriend has \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. He admits he let it go on too long, which shows he realizes some fault there. But when he finally says no to her request, she gets angry. He then explains that sex is great but not everything, and he needed to relax. He also said some harsh things, like she thinks too highly of herself, which he acknowledges might be over the line.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's setting a boundary, which is his right. He's tired and needed rest. Using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative, so he's trying to correct that. On the other hand, his response was harsh. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself could be hurtful and maybe escalate the conflict. Also, the fact that he admitted to letting it go on too long suggests he didn't address the issue earlier, which could contribute to the problem.\n\nBut the key point is that he's trying to correct a dynamic where she's using sex as leverage. Setting boundaries is important in a relationship. Even if his delivery was harsh, the core issue of her manipulation is a valid concern. He's not wrong for wanting to address that. However, his approach might have been confrontational. The fact that he says \"understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot\" shows he's aware of her behavior and is trying to push back against it. \n\nSo, considering both sides: he's not entirely wrong for setting boundaries, but his method could be improved. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he was standing up for himself against manipulative behavior, maybe he's not in the wrong. But his harsh words might be a factor. The answer might be B (No), because he's correcting a problematic dynamic, even if his approach could be better. The main issue is her using sex as a tool, and he's trying to address that.\n"
