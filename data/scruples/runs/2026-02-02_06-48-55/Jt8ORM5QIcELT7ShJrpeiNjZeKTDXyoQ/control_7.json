She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy correcting his girlfriend's views on the importance of sex in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has some misconceptions. She thinks sex is the most important thing and uses it to convince him to do things he doesn't want to do. The guy admits he's been letting this happen for too long, probably because he enjoys the sex. Then, when she asks him to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex, he says no because he's tired and wants to relax. This causes an argument where he tells her that sex isn't everything and that he could take care of himself, which she took as over the line.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The guy is trying to set boundaries, which is generally a good thing. If someone is using manipulation or coercion (like a \"get out of jail free card\") to get their way, the person being manipulated has the right to say no. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. He admitted that telling her she thinks too highly of herself was over the line. That's probably a hurtful thing to say, even if he's frustrated.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about whether he's in the wrong for correcting the record. The main issue is his refusal to do something she wanted, which she expected due to the sex. If he's setting a boundary by saying no, that's his right. However, the argument escalated because of his harsh words. So maybe he's not entirely wrong for setting a boundary but perhaps crossed a line in how he communicated it.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's using sex as a bargaining chip, that's a manipulation tactic. He's correcting that by stating sex isn't a reward but a mutual thing. But when he says she thinks too highly of herself, that's a personal attack, which isn't helpful. So maybe he's justified in setting the boundary but handled it poorly.\n\nThe key points are: Is it right for him to set boundaries, even if it causes conflict? And is it wrong for him to make a harsh comment, even if it's in response to her manipulation?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he's been letting her manipulate him and now decided to change that, he's taking a stand. However, the way he communicated his needs could be improved. But being in the wrong usually means he shouldn't have set the boundary. Since setting boundaries is generally healthy, he's not wrong for doing that. However, the harsh words might make him partially at fault for the escalation.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. The main issue is the correction of her misuse of sex. He's right to address that, so he's not entirely wrong. The harsh comment is a mistake, but that doesn't necessarily make the entire situation his fault. So the answer might be B (No), because he's standing up for himself, even if he could have handled it better. Alternatively, the harsh words might tip the balance to A (Yes), if the comment was too aggressive.\n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The act of correcting her misuse of sex is justified. The over-the-line comment is a separate issue. So the answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong for setting the boundary, even if he made a mistake in his phrasing.\n"
