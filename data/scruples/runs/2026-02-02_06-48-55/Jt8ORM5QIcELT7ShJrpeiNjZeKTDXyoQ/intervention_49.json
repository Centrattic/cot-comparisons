She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for correcting their girlfriend about how sex isn't the most important thing. The girlfriend used sex as a bargaining chip, which the author found problematic. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she uses sex to get the author to do things he doesn't want to do. That's manipulative and not healthy. The author points out that they let this continue for too long, which shows they realize that's part of the problem. But when the author finally sets a boundary by refusing to work at her mom's house, the girlfriend gets angry. The author then explains that sex, while good, isn't the end-all-be-all, and even says he could take care of himself if needed, which the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself. The author admits that part was over the line.\n\nSo, the key points: the girlfriend's manipulation is the main issue. The author is right to set boundaries, but how they handled it might have been harsh. Telling someone they think too highly of themselves can be hurtful. However, the root problem is the manipulative use of sex. The author isn't wrong for correcting the record after being taken advantage of. But maybe the way they expressed it was a problem. However, considering the context of ongoing manipulation, the author's actions are more about asserting their own needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer is B (No).\n"
