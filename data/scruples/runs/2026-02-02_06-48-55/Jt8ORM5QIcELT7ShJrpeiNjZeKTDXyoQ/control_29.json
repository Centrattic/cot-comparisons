Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author correcting their girlfriend about her views on sex and setting a boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend has these ideas where she thinks sex is the most important thing in the author's life and uses it to persuade him to do things he doesn't want to. The author agrees because the sex is great, but he's now realizing that he's letting it go on too long. \n\nThen, the girlfriend asks him to work at her mom's house on his only day off in exchange for good sex. He's tired and wants to rest, so he turns her down. She gets angry, and he explains that sex isn't everything. He even says that he can take care of himself and that she thinks too highly of herself, which he admits might be over the line. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nTo determine this, I should consider both sides. The author's actions: he's setting a boundary by refusing to work on his day off, which he's entitled to. However, he also made a harsh comment about her thinking too highly of herself, which could be hurtful. The girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip is problematic, as it's manipulative and not healthy. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author is trying to correct her manipulative behavior, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. However, his response might have been too harsh. The fact that he acknowledges he's at fault for letting it go on shows he's self-aware. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? He's standing up for himself, which is good, but the way he communicated it might have been poor. The girlfriend's use of sex as leverage is definitely an issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person is making a reasonable stand to correct an unhealthy dynamic. The author is trying to address a pattern of behavior that's been going on, so he's not entirely wrong. However, his harsh comment might have been inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting a necessary boundary and addressing her manipulative behavior, even if his delivery could have been better. But I should check if there's any other angle. \n\nWait, maybe some people might think he's being rude by saying she thinks too highly of herself. But given her manipulative tactics, his frustration is understandable. The main issue is her using sex as a bargaining chip, which is the real problem here. The author is trying to correct that, so he's not the one at fault.\n"
