She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about correcting the record regarding sex in their relationship. The user's girlfriend (gf) seems to have placed a lot of importance on sex, even using it as a way to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author mentions that he went along with this for a while because the sex was great, but now he's pushing back when she asked him to work for her mom in exchange for sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. It sounds like she's been using sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative and unfair. The author is trying to set a boundary by refusing to work for her mom in exchange for sex. That's a valid boundary because no one should have to trade their time or labor for intimacy. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He admitted that his response was a bit harsh, saying she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself. That could come off as dismissive or hurtful, even if the initial request was unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, setting boundaries is important in any relationship. If someone is using sex to manipulate, it's healthy to correct that behavior. The author acknowledges that he's at fault for letting it go on too long, which shows self-awareness. But the confrontation might have been handled poorly. He could have explained his need to relax without belittling her feelings. The fact that he tried to correct the record by stating that sex isn't the end-all-be-all is a positive step towards a healthier dynamic.\n\nSo, the key points are: setting boundaries is right, but the method and tone matter. He's in the right for not giving in to manipulation, but his harsh response might have contributed to the conflict. The question is whether the wrong lies in his correction or the way he delivered it. Since he was trying to correct a harmful pattern, maybe he's not in the wrong overall, but his approach could be improved. However, the user initially thought he was at fault, which makes me consider if the act of correcting her was the issue. But using sex as leverage is a problem, so he's justified in standing up for himself. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing an unhealthy dynamic, even if his method wasn't perfect.\n"
