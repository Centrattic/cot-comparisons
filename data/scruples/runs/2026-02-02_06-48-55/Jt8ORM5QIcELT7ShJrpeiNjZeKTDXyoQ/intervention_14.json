She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author correcting their girlfriend about her views on sex and setting a boundary by refusing to work at her mom's house when they're too tired.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip. The author has let this go for a while, thinking it's great and going along with it. Now, when they're really beat, they say no and have to explain that sex isn't the end-all-be-all. The author admits to going over the line by saying the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself, which might have been harsh, but they justify it because she uses sex a lot as leverage.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is their right. It's important to prioritize self-care, especially when they're exhausted. The girlfriend's reaction is anger and surprise, indicating she wasn't expecting the refusal. The author's correction of the record is about mutual respect and honesty.\n\nHowever, the author did cross a line by implying the girlfriend overestimates her value. That could come off as dismissive or arrogant. But overall, setting a boundary is necessary, especially when the other person is manipulative. The fact that the author acknowledges their fault for letting things go on is a positive step.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's limits. The author's actions here aim to establish healthier dynamics. So while the harsh comment wasn't great, the main act of setting a boundary is justified. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, despite the over-the-line comment.\n"
