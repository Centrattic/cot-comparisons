She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is in a relationship where his girlfriend uses sex as a way to get him to do things. He admits he let it go on for too long because he enjoyed the sex. Now, when she asked him to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex, he turned her down because he was tired. The argument escalated, and he said some harsh things, like she thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is using sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative and can be a red flag in a relationship. The author acknowledges that he's at fault for letting this continue. But when he finally says no, she gets angry. He responds by making her feel bad about herself, which is mean and probably not okay. \n\nIs it wrong for him to correct her? Well, he's setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. That part is understandable. But the way he communicated the boundary might be the issue. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself and that she's not essential in that moment could be hurtful. Healthy communication is key in relationships, so maybe he should have handled it without putting her down. \n\nHe also mentions that he's beat and wanted to relax. That's a valid reason to say no, but the method of refusal matters. The problem might be that he didn't address the underlying issue of her using sex as a manipulative tool. Instead, he focused on the immediate rejection, which led to a heated argument. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate needs without attacking the other person. The author might have been right to set a boundary but in a way that's disrespectful. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong for saying no, but the way he handled it is where he made a mistake. Therefore, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because his response was hurtful, even if his initial refusal was justified. Or maybe B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for himself. It's tricky. I need to decide if the main issue is the refusal or the harsh words. Since he admitted he went over the line with his words, that's probably the key point. So the answer is A.\n"
