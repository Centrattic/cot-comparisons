She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the author (AITA) corrects their girlfriend on her views about sex. The girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip, which the author has let slide before but now pushed back. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend has some beliefs that sex is the most important thing and uses it to manipulate the author into doing things they don't want to do. The author acknowledges they let it go for too long. Now, the author turned down her request to work at her mom's house, leading to an argument. The author also made a harsh comment, saying the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself, which the author admits might be over the line.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants opinions. The answer should be A or B. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries. Using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative and unhealthy. The author is correcting that behavior, which is a positive step. However, the way they did it\u2014making a harsh comment\u2014could be seen as hurtful. The author acknowledges that part was over the line, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is problematic. She's using sex to control the author's actions, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The author is trying to stop that by asserting their needs. The author's outburst might have been a mistake, but the core issue of setting boundaries is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are: the author is addressing an unhealthy dynamic, but their method included a harsh comment. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's manipulative behavior. The author's correction is justified, but their delivery could be improved. The fact that the author admits they overstepped might balance it. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not addressing issues earlier. The author did let it go for too long but is now trying to correct it, which is positive. The harsh comment is a flaw, but the overall action of setting boundaries is right. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior and the author is taking steps to address it, even if the method had a flaw.\n"
