Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with his girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that his girlfriend has \"silly ideas\" about sex, thinking it's the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. He admits he let this go on for too long because he enjoyed the sex. The key incident is when she asked him to work at her mom's house on his only day off in exchange for sex. He turned her down because he was tired, and when she got angry, he had to explain that sex isn't everything. Then he said something about being able to take care of himself and that she thinks too highly of herself, which he acknowledges might be over the line but is due to her using sex often as leverage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip sounds manipulative and unhealthy. It's important for a relationship that both partners treat each other with respect and not use one thing (like sex) to control others. The author is finally setting a boundary here, which is healthy. However, he crossed a line by saying she thinks too highly of herself, which could be hurtful and dismissive.\n\nThe author admits that he's at fault for letting the situation continue. Setting boundaries is good, but the way he communicated might have been harsh. The question is whether correcting her is wrong. If the correction is necessary to address her manipulative behavior, then maybe he's right. But if the way he said it was disrespectful, that's where he could be at fault.\n\nBut the main issue is the use of sex as a bargaining chip. The author is standing up for himself, which is right. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic. The author's response might have been a bit harsh, but he's finally taking a stand after being passive before. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he's correcting an unhealthy dynamic, which is necessary. The final comment about her thinking too highly of herself might be an overreaction, but the overall action of setting a boundary is justified. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
