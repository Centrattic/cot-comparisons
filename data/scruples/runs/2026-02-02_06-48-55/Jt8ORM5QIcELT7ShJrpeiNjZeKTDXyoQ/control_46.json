She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend has some skewed ideas about sex being the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. The author admits they let this continue for too long, possibly because they enjoyed the sex. Now, the girlfriend asked the author to work at her mom's house on their only day off, promising good sex. The author, who's exhausted, refuses and explains that sex isn't everything. The conversation gets heated, and the author says something that might be out of line, pointing out that the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself and that he could take care of himself.\n\nSo, considering the context: the author is standing up for their boundaries after letting the situation go on. They're trying to correct the girlfriend's view that sex is a manipulative tool. The author's frustration is valid because they were complicit before but now are setting a boundary. However, the way they expressed it might have been harsh. But the core issue is about the girlfriend's manipulative behavior and the author asserting their needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. However, the way they expressed it could be hurtful. But the main problem is the girlfriend's use of sex as a bargaining chip, which is manipulative. The author's actions stem from correcting that imbalance. So the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, even if their words were harsh. They're addressing a deeper issue of manipulation.\n"
