She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex. The main points I notice are:\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has what the author considers \"silly ideas\" about sex being the most important thing and using it as a bargaining chip. The author admits he let this go on for too long but now is correcting her. He turned down her request to work at her mom's house after saying he was too tired. The argument got heated, and he said something that might have been over the line, like implying she thinks too highly of herself.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is standing up for his own needs, which is important in a relationship. If someone is using sex to manipulate, it's valid to set boundaries. The author did acknowledge that he went along before but now decided to say no, which shows he's trying to establish limits. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her out on her self-importance, which could be hurtful. But given that she was using sex as leverage, maybe that was necessary to correct.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it more calmly instead of escalating. But he also mentions he's beat and just wanted to relax, so his frustration is understandable. The key here is whether correcting her is in the wrong. If she's been manipulative, he's not entirely at fault. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner is using sex to get their way, the other has a right to push back. The author isn't wrong for asserting his needs, even if the method could have been better. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
