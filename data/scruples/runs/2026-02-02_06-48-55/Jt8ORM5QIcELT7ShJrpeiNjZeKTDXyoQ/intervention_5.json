She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with their girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip to get the author to do things they don't want to do. The author eventually sets a boundary by refusing to help her mother and explains that sex isn't everything, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that they let the situation continue for too long, which shows they recognized the imbalance. The girlfriend's approach of using sex as a way to manipulate or get things done is problematic. The author setting a boundary by saying no is a healthy action in a relationship. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh, especially the part about taking care of themselves and the girlfriend thinking too highly of herself. That could come off as dismissive or hurtful.\n\nThe key points are whether setting boundaries is wrong and if the method used was appropriate. Setting boundaries is generally right, but how they're communicated matters. The author admitted that their response might have been over the line, which suggests they see a fault in their delivery. The girlfriend's behavior is manipulative, so the author's correction is a response to that manipulation. However, the conflict escalated because of the author's harsh words. \n\nI need to weigh the right to set boundaries against the method used. Since the author was correcting a manipulative dynamic, they're in a gray area. They did the right thing by setting a boundary but might have handled it poorly. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's manipulation, so the author's action isn't entirely their fault. But the way they expressed it was offensive. So the answer might be A (wrong) because of the harsh response, but also B (not wrong) for setting a boundary. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they admitted fault in their delivery, it's possible they are at least partially wrong. But the main issue is the girlfriend's manipulation. It's tricky. Maybe the answer is A because they crossed a line with their words, even if the intent was to set a boundary. Alternatively, B because standing up for oneself is justified. Need to decide based on typical perspectives. In AITA forums, people often consider both actions. The author's harsh words could make them partially at fault, but the overall situation is about correcting manipulation. I think the answer leans towards A because the author's response was hurtful, even if the issue was valid. So the answer is A.\n"
