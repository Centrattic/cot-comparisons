She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after correcting their girlfriend about using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend uses sex as a way to get them to do things they don't want to do. The author finally sets a boundary by refusing to comply with her request to work at her mom's house, leading to an argument. The author then says some harsh things, like implying they can take care of themselves and that the girlfriend has too high an opinion of herself.\n\nThe author admits they let this behavior go on too long because they enjoyed the sex. Now, they're setting a boundary, which is generally healthy. However, the way they communicated it might be problematic. Saying something like \"you think too highly of yourself\" could come off as dismissive or insulting, especially in the heat of an argument. That might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, setting boundaries is important in any relationship. If the girlfriend was using sex as a manipulative tool, the author has every right to stop enabling that behavior. The fact that they acknowledged their part in letting it continue is a sign of self-awareness.\n\nBut the key point here is how the boundary was enforced. The author's harsh words might have been a reaction to feeling manipulated, but the delivery could have been hurtful. Healthy communication usually involves expressing needs without belittling the other person. The author might have been right to set the boundary but wrong in the method of doing so.\n\nSo, considering both sides: The author is right to correct the behavior, but the way they did it might be in the wrong. The question is whether the harshness of their response makes them at fault. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
