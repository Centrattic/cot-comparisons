She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting their girlfriend about the importance of sex in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend has a view that sex is the most important thing and uses it as a bargaining chip. The author finally stood up for themselves by refusing to comply with her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex. They had a heated argument and said some things that might have been harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author felt taken advantage of, which is a valid reason to set a boundary. Using sex as a bargaining chip is manipulative and not healthy. The author's frustration is understandable because they had been letting it go too long. However, the way they expressed their feelings might have been too harsh, like saying the GF thinks too highly of herself. That could have been hurtful and might have escalated the situation.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was in the wrong. The act of correcting the record and asserting their needs isn't inherently wrong. Setting boundaries is important in any relationship. The problem might be in the tone or the specific words used, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the GF. The GF's behavior was manipulative, so the author had a right to address it. However, the author could have handled it more calmly to avoid escalation.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had a valid reason to set boundaries. However, the approach could be improved. But according to the question, the main point is whether the author is in the wrong, not the method. So the answer should be B.\n"
