She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for correcting their girlfriend about the importance of sex in their relationship. The situation is that the girlfriend uses sex as a way to get things done, like making the author work at her mom's house. The author finally says no, explaining that sex isn't the be-all and end-all and that they need to relax. They admitted that maybe their response was harsh, but they felt it was necessary because the girlfriend overestimates her role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's behavior of using sex as a bargaining chip could be manipulative or transactional, which isn't healthy. The author was allowing this for a while, which they admit they're at fault for. Then, when they finally set a boundary, they were met with anger. The author corrected the dynamic, stating that sex isn't everything, which is a valid point because relationships should be about mutual respect and not transactional sex. \n\nHowever, the way the author communicated this might have been confrontational. They said things like the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself, which could come off as disrespectful. But the root issue is the manipulation through sex. The author had the right to set a boundary, especially after enduring it for so long. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're standing up for themselves and correcting a unhealthy dynamic, then no. However, the method of communication could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for the action of correcting the record. Since the manipulation is on the girlfriend's part, the author isn't wrong for addressing it. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
