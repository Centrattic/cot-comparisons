She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex in their relationship. The author's girlfriend (gf) used sex as a way to manipulate him into doing things he didn't want to do, like working at her mom's house. The author finally said no because he was tired and wanted to relax. He explained that while sex is great, it's not the be-all and end-all. They got into an argument, and the author even said something harsh about her thinking too highly of herself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect in a relationship. If the gf is using sex as a bargaining chip, that's a form of manipulation, which is unhealthy. The author had the right to set boundaries. However, the way he communicated his refusal might have been harsh. The key points here are whether the author's actions were justified and if he handled the situation appropriately.\n\nHe admitted he went along with it before because the sex was great. This time, he said no and explained his reasoning. Even though he was tired, he had the right to prioritize his needs. The argument escalated when he made a hurtful comment about her self-esteem. While using sex to manipulate is wrong, his response might have been too harsh. However, he did correct the power dynamic where she used sex as a tool. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he set a boundary and communicated his feelings, even if it was blunt, maybe not. But the harsh remark could be problematic. However, the main issue is her manipulation, which he had a right to address. I think the balance tips towards the author not being in the wrong because he's asserting his needs and correcting an unhealthy dynamic. So the answer would be B.\n"
