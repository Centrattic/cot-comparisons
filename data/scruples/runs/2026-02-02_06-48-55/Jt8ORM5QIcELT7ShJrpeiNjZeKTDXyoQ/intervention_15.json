She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip to get the author to do things he doesn't want to do. The author finally corrects her, stands up for himself by refusing a request and mentions that he can take care of himself, which upset her.\n\nFirst, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to consider both perspectives. The author admits fault for letting things go on too long and acknowledges that sex is great. However, he's now asserting his boundaries. The key points here are about mutual respect, consent, and healthy relationship dynamics.\n\nUsing sex as a bargaining chip can be manipulative. The author is trying to correct that by setting boundaries, which is a healthy step. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh, especially saying she thinks too highly of herself. That could come off as disrespectful. But the situation is about him finally standing up for himself after enduring her manipulative behavior.\n\nIs it wrong to correct someone when they're using sex inappropriately? Probably not. Healthy relationships require both partners to respect each other's boundaries. The author was complicit before, but now he's taking a stand. The initial part where he admits fault is important because it shows self-awareness.\n\nThe argument here is whether correcting her is justified. Since she used sex as a tool for manipulation, the author's correction is necessary for a balanced relationship. The harsh part might be the way he phrased it, but the intent is to set a boundary. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's addressing an unhealthy dynamic in the relationship.\n"
