She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a relationship where their girlfriend uses sex as a way to get them to do things they don't want to do. The author finally decides to correct her by saying that sex isn't the most important thing even though they usually go along with it because they enjoy it. They ended up getting into an argument, and the author said some things that might have been a bit harsh, like saying the girlfriend thinks too highly of herself.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to see both sides. On one hand, the author is standing up for their own needs, which is important in a relationship. It's healthy to set boundaries and not let someone manipulate you, even if it's your partner. The author mentions that they were letting it go on too long, so they're acknowledging that they had a role in allowing the behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the way the author handled the situation might have been confrontational. They called out the girlfriend's manipulation tactics and even said she thinks too highly of herself, which could have been hurtful. The girlfriend was surprised and angry, which shows that the conversation was unexpected and maybe not handled in the best way. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for correcting the behavior? The core issue here is the use of sex as a bargaining chip, which is a form of manipulation. The author has the right to set boundaries and communicate that they won't be pressured into things. However, the method of communication could be improved. Instead of being confrontational, maybe a more gentle approach would have been better. \n\nAlso, the author admits that they had been letting it slide for too long, which implies that they should have addressed it earlier. They took action, which is good, but the way they did it might have been harsh. So there's some responsibility on the author's part for not handling the conversation more carefully. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's intention was to correct a problematic behavior, which is valid. But the execution might have caused more conflict than necessary. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" overall. Given that the main issue was the girlfriend's manipulation and the author was trying to correct it, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance because of how they handled it. But since the user is asking for a yes or no, and the main fault lies with the girlfriend's behavior, the author is justified in setting boundaries, so the answer is B.\n"
