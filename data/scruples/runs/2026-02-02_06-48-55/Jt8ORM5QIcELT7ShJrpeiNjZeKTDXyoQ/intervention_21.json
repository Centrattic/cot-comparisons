She thought it was the most important thing in my life and kinda a get out of jail free card.   Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting the record about sex with his girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says his girlfriend had some silly ideas about sex being the most important thing in his life and used it as a bargaining chip. He let it go on too long, but now he's setting a boundary by refusing her request to work at her mom's house in exchange for sex. He ended up saying that sex isn't the end all and that he could take care of himself, which he admits might be over the line. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that the author is being dismissive or not honoring the previous dynamic where sex was part of the negotiation. On the other hand, the author is trying to set a boundary, which is important in any relationship. Healthily, people should be able to say no without guilt, but the way the author expressed it might have been harsh. He called her self-centered for using sex as a bargaining chip, which could be seen as an attack on her motives. Even if he's justified in needing rest, the manner of his response matters. \n\nSetting boundaries is good, but the method and communication style are key. If he was rude or invalidated her feelings, that's problematic. Also, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The author admitted that his comment about her thinking too highly of herself was over the line, which suggests he acknowledged some fault. However, the core issue is whether he had the right to correct her and set this boundary. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because setting boundaries is necessary. However, the way he communicated it might be where he went wrong. So, he's not entirely at fault, but there's room for improvement in how he approached the situation. The answer might be B (no), but with the caveat that communication style was an issue.\n"
