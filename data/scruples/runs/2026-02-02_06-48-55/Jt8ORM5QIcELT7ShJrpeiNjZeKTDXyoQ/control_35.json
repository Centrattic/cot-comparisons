Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting their girlfriend's view that sex is the most important thing and using it to manipulate them.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author mentions that their girlfriend has \"silly ideas about men and sex,\" thinking it's the most important and a \"get out of jail free card.\" She uses it to convince him to do things he doesn't want to do. The author admits they let it go on too long because the sex is great, so they complied. \n\nThen there's the incident where the girlfriend asked him to work for her mom on his only day off, promising good sex. He's exhausted and declines. She gets angry, and he explains that sex isn't the end-all. The argument heats up, and he says he can take care of himself and she thinks too highly of herself. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend's manipulative behavior, the author's past inaction, and the recent confrontation. The question is whether the author is wrong for correcting her.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author did correct her, which is reasonable if she's using sex as a manipulative tool. However, he admitted he didn't address it until now, which might have contributed to the problem. In the argument, he went too far by saying she thinks too highly of herself, which could be hurtful. But defending himself against manipulation is valid. \n\nThe user is asking for a binary answer A or B. The options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. Considering that the author is trying to set boundaries after a period of inaction, but also made a harsh comment, but the main issue is the girlfriend's manipulative tactics. The author isn't entirely wrong for correcting the behavior. However, the initial part where he didn't address her manipulative behavior for a long time might be a point against him. But the question is about the recent situation. The immediate action he took was to correct her, which is right. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but the harsh comment was probably over the line. However, the main issue is the manipulation, so he's in the right to correct her. So the answer is B.\n"
