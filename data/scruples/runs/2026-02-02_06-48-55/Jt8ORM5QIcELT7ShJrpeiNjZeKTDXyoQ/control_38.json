Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about him correcting the record regarding sex with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that his girlfriend has some incorrect ideas about sex being the most important thing in his life and uses it as a bargaining chip to get him to do things he doesn't want. He admits he let this go on for too long because sex with her is great. Now, he turned down her request for a day of work in exchange for sex because he's tired and wants to relax. The argument escalated, and he said some harsh things, making him question if he crossed a line.\n\nSo, to figure out if he's in the wrong, I need to look at both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend is using sex as a manipulative tool, which is unhealthy. He's trying to set boundaries, which is generally a good thing. It's important to communicate needs and not let others pressure you into things you don't want to do. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. He says he went too far by implying she thinks too highly of herself, which could be hurtful. \n\nBut the core issue is whether he's in the wrong for asserting his needs. If the girlfriend's behavior is manipulative, then standing up for himself isn't wrong. However, the method of communication matters. Yelling or being disrespectful could be where he's at fault. However, in AITA scenarios, people often get labeled as \"not at fault\" if they're addressing toxic behavior. The user also admits he's not perfect for letting it continue, but the main action here is setting a boundary. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he's correcting a manipulative dynamic, even if his words were harsh.\n"
