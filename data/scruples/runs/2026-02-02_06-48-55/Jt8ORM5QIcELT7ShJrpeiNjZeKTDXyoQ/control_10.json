Also she would use it to talk me into doing stuff I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nI\u2019m at fault here for letting it go on as long as I did.   Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author correcting their girlfriend about her views on sex. The girlfriend uses sex as a bargaining chip to get him to do things he doesn't want to do, like working at her mom's house. The author finally says no because he's tired and wants to relax. He explains that sex is great but not everything, and then gets a bit harsh by saying she thinks too highly of herself. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's behavior is manipulative, using sex as a tool to get what she wants. The author has let this continue for a while, which he admits he's at fault for. Now, when he sets a boundary by refusing her request, she gets angry. The author then explains his reasoning, which is that he values his own time and relaxation. He goes a bit too far in his words, which the user acknowledges might be over the line.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and mutual respect in their relationship. Using sex as a bargaining chip is a form of coercion, which is unhealthy. The author finally standing up for himself by setting a boundary is a positive step. However, his approach might have been harsh, especially the part about her thinking too highly of herself. That could be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nBut considering the context, the author is trying to correct a pattern of behavior that's been ongoing. He's taking responsibility for letting it go on too long, which shows self-awareness. His main point is to assert his own needs, which is important in any relationship. The key is whether correcting her and setting boundaries is wrong. Since the girlfriend's approach is manipulative, the author isn't wrong for addressing it. The harsh comment might be an issue, but the overall action of setting a boundary is valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's correcting an unhealthy dynamic and asserting his own needs, even if the method could be improved. The girlfriend's use of sex as a manipulative tool is the real problem here.\n"
