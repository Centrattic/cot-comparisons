Sex with her is pretty great and I would go along with it. \n\nLast night however she asked me to spend my only day off this week (today) working at her mother\u2019s house with the promise of some good sex.  Normally I\u2019d go along with it, but I\u2019m beat.  I just wanted to sit around and recover. \n\nShe was really surprised when I turned her down. She got angry.  I ended up having to explain to her that sex with her is awesome and all, but it\u2019s not the end all. That I would rather go without it and be able to relax today.  \n\nThings got heated and I told her that if I really needed to I could take care of myself and she thinks way too highly of herself.  That was probably over the line, but understand that she uses sex as a bargaining chip a lot.   \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy correcting his girlfriend about her views on sex. He's saying she thought sex was the most important thing and used it to get him to do things. He ended up rejecting her last time when she asked him to work at her mom's house, which made her angry. He had to explain that while sex is good, it's not everything, and he needed to take a break. He went a bit too far by saying he could take care of himself and she thinks too highly of herself. The user is unsure if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend using sex as a bargaining chip is definitely an issue. Manipulating someone into doing things they don't want through sex is not healthy. The author is correct in pointing out that he has boundaries and that sex shouldn't control his actions. However, his response might have been harsh. Telling her she thinks too highly of herself could be hurtful, even if he had a point. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given the context.\n\nHe admitted he let the situation go on too long, which shows some self-awareness. The situation might have been built up over time, and the last incident was the breaking point. The author is asserting his needs, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he communicated it might have been too aggressive. Healthy communication is key, and while he's right to set boundaries, the method could be improved.\n\nOn the other hand, she used sex as a tool for manipulation, which is a problem. The author is correcting the record to establish that sex isn't the only priority, which is reasonable. The fact that he's willing to admit fault for not addressing it sooner is a positive sign. The conflict here is between her manipulative behavior and his response to it. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries. If she's using sex as leverage, that's a red flag. The author is standing up for himself, which is necessary. However, the way he expressed his frustration might have escalated the situation. It's possible he's in the right to correct her behavior, but perhaps the delivery could be smoother.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's main issue is correcting her misuse of sex, which is valid. His harsh words were over the line, but the underlying issue is her manipulation. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing a problem in the relationship, even if his approach could be better.\n"
